1,"A prospective, controlled trial of a pharmacy-driven alert system to increase rates of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical patients.","Although venous thromboembolism is a major cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality, a significant proportion of hospitalized patients at risk do not receive measures known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a pharmacy-driven alert system, compared with usual care, would be associated with a higher rate of adequate venous thromboembolism prevention measures among at-risk hospitalized patients in an internal medicine service. general. The study was a prospective controlled trial conducted at a university teaching hospital. Participants were adults admitted (Monday to Friday) to the general internal medicine inpatient ward from June 19 to September 21, 2006. Their treatment included a pharmaceutical assessment of venous thromboembolism risk and a pharmacist-directed alert to the treating physician. The proportion of patients at risk who received adequate thromboprophylaxis within 36 hours of admission was recorded. Overall, 140 patients were at sufficient risk of venous thromboembolism to be included. In the usual care group, prophylactic measures were ordered for 49 (61%) of the 80 patients at moderate to high risk. In the pharmacist alert group, 44 (73%) of 60 patients at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism received adequate thromboprophylaxis (p = 0.15). Although we did not observe a statistically significant difference between groups, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that alert systems may increase the proportion of hospitalized patients who receive adequate measures to prevent venous thromboembolism.",0,1,
2,Effect of a clinical pharmacy service on lipid control in patients with peripheral arterial disease.,"Objective Our group and others have previously established that patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are significantly undertreated with respect to overall management of cardiovascular risk factors, despite national guidelines to the contrary. In an effort to maximize risk factor control in our PAD patients, we established a physician-controlled, pharmacist-managed algorithmic approach to outpatient lipid management in PAD patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of this service on the detection and control of lipids in patients with PAD. Methods We analyzed the records of patients treated in a large, regional, nonprofit managed care system, group model, serving approximately 405,000 members. An electronic medical record provided complete examination, laboratory, and pharmacy data for all patients. Pharmacy data were analyzed to determine prescriptions for lipid-lowering agents. Lipid control was assessed through fasting lipid data. Patients with validated PAD and no clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) were offered the service between May 2003 and September 2004 and followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Results A total of 5159 active patients diagnosed with PAD were administratively identified. Of these, 1075 could be validated with a non-invasive arterial study. Exclusion of 384 patients diagnosed with CAD resulted in a cohort of 691 patients. Of these, 90 patients were enrolled in the lipid service (study group) and 601 received standard care. The mean follow-up was 17.1 months. Fasting lipid profiles were found in 95.6% (86/90) of study group patients and only 66.9% (402/601) of standard care patients (p < 0.0001 ). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control was improved in the pharmacist-administered group, with 79.1% (68/86) achieving LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL compared with the standard care group (54.8% [219/400]"";"" p < 0.0001). An LDL-C value of more than 130 mg/dl was observed in 1.2% and 14.0% (56/400) in the treatment and control groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Statin use was present in 51.9% (312/601) of patients in the control group and in 84.4% (76/90) in the pharmacist-administered group (p < 0.001). Conclusions Despite the national consensus of PAD as equivalent to CEA, patients currently do not receive adequate treatment with respect to atherosclerotic risk factor modification. Initiation of a physician-monitored, pharmacist-managed lipid service provides better adherence to national guidelines",0,1,
3,Using peer feedback to improve handwashing and glove use among Thai health workers.,"Background: Without protective practices such as Universal Precautions, healthcare workers are at considerable risk of blood-borne infections, especially in areas such as Thailand with a high prevalence of HIV infection. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a peer feedback program (PFP) on handwashing and glove use (HW/GW) among Thai health care workers. Methods: Subjects (N = 91) were randomized to receive PFP versus no treatment. Using a checklist, peer observers rated their co-workers' HW/GW compliance during patient care. For 1 month, the investigator published a report of compliance behaviors for every 3 days of observations. The investigator also assessed HW/GW by direct observation 1 month before the intervention, during the intervention period, and 1 month after the intervention. Results: The initial HW/GW rates for the PFP and control groups were 49.2% and 61.5%, respectively. The PFP group had a significantly higher adjusted compliance rate than the control group during the intervention period (p = 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in compliance scores obtained 1 month after the intervention. Conclusions: The PFP was effective during the intervention period, but there was no retention of the effect. Therefore, complementary methods should be sought to promote effect retention.

6,"“First, do no harm”: legal guidelines for health programs that affect adolescents aged 10 to 17 who sell sex or inject drugs","INTRODUCTION: There is a strong evidence base that stigma, discrimination and criminalization affecting key populations (KP) of adolescents aged 10 to 17 years is intensified due to national and international legal constructions that are based on evidence-based interventions. law enforcement dependent on arrest, detention trial, incarceration, and mandatory ""rehabilitation"" in institutional placement. While there are evidence-based and rights-based technical guidelines for interventions among older cohorts, these guidelines have not yet been adopted by international public health actors for fear that international law will apply different standards to adolescents aged 10-17. years who engage in behavior such as the sale of sex. or inject drugs. DISCUSSION: As a matter of international human rights, health, juvenile justice, and child protection law, interventions among PC adolescents ages 10-17 should not involve arrest, prosecution, or detention of any kind. It is imperative that interventions are not based on law enforcement, but rather on low-threshold voluntary services, shelter and support, using peer-based outreach as much as possible. These services should be mobile and accessible, and allow alternatives to parental consent for the provision of life support, including HIV testing, treatment and care, needle and syringe programmes, opioid substitution therapy, safe abortions, antiretroviral therapy and gender-affirming care. and hormone treatment for transgender adolescents. To ensure enrollment in services, international guidance indicates that informed consent and confidentiality must be guaranteed, including the waiver of parental consent requirements. To remove the disincentive for health professionals and researchers to engage with adolescent PCs ages 10 to 17, government agencies and ethical review boards are encouraged to waive or waive mandatory reporting. In the event that, in violation of international law and guidance, authorities attempt to involuntarily place KP adolescents in institutions, they are entitled to judicial process. The legal guidelines also state that these adolescents have influence over their location, access to legal advice to challenge the conditions of their detention, and regular visits from peers, friends and family, and that all facilities are subject to frequent and regular reviews by independent bodies, including PC-led community groups. CONCLUSIONS: International control law specifies that protection interventions among 10- to 17-year-old KPs must not only include low-threshold voluntary services, but also ""protect"" adolescent KPs from the harms that come with evidence-based interventions. application of the law. Going forward, health professionals must respect the right to health by adjusting programs according to the principles of minimal intervention, due process, and proportionality, and duly limit the involvement of juvenile justice and child protection as a measure of last resort. appeal, if applicable.",0,0,
7,"""How much do they pay you if I volunteer?"" Suggested Institutional Policy on Reward, Consent, and Research","Pharmaceutical companies often ask practicing physicians to conduct phase IV or post-market research on new drugs. Companies pay doctors to enroll their patients and report dosage and side effects. Post-marketing research encompasses a multimillion-dollar promotion and awareness effort, but informed consent from subjects typically does not include physician reward. Improving the financial status of investigators while increasing medical risks to phase IV subjects is ethically unsound, especially if the subjects are unaware of the investigators' rewards. We suggest a model policy and guidelines that affirm the need for informed consent from subjects, the need for recognition and support from investigators, and the need for institutions to protect patients from undisclosed risks and relationships.",0,0,

9,"""Let Me Get You a Nicotine Patch"": Nurses' Perceptions of Implementing Smoking Cessation Guidelines for Hospitalized Veterans","Many hospitalized smokers do not receive guideline-recommended anti-smoking treatment, but little is known about inpatient nurses' perceptions of anti-smoking treatment. We used a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to help explain the findings of a detailed intervention academic trial in the inpatient medicine units of four Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. We surveyed 164 nurses and conducted semi-structured interviews on a purposive sample of 33 nurses with different attitudes towards smoking cessation advice. Content analysis was used to inductively characterize the issues raised by the participants. Emerging themes were categorized using the guideline adherence knowledge-attitudes-behavior framework. Barriers related to knowledge and attitudes included perceived lack of skills in smoking cessation counseling and skepticism about the effectiveness of smoking cessation guidelines in hospitalized veterans. Nurses also reported multiple behavioral and organizational barriers to guideline adherence: patient resistance, insufficient time and resources, the presence of smoking areas in VA facilities, and lack of coordination with primary care. VA hospitals should train inpatient staff on how to negotiate behavior change, integrate smoking cessation counseling into nurses' workflow, develop alternative referral mechanisms for post-discharge cessation counseling and adopt hospital policies to promote abstinence for hospitalized patients.",0,0,

11,(S)Partners for Heart Health: A school-based program to improve physical activity and nutrition to promote cardiovascular health in fifth graders,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association position statement on promoting cardiovascular health in public schools encourages school-based interventions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the prevention or reduction of risk factors in children, with an emphasis on creating an environment that promotes healthy food choices. and physical activity (PA). In an effort to address issues related to CVD risk factors, including obesity, in Michigan children, a multidisciplinary team of Michigan State University (MSU) faculty, physicians, and health professions students was assembled. to ""(S)associate"" with elementary school physicists. physical education (PE) teachers and MSU Extension staff to develop and implement a cost-effective and sustainable program aimed at preventing and managing CVD risk factors for fifth grade students. This (S)partnership seeks to augment and improve the existing fifth grade physical education, health, and nutrition curriculum by achieving the following goals: 1) improve students' knowledge, attitudes, and confidence about nutrition, physical activity and heart health""; 2) increase the number of students meeting national recommendations for PA and nutrition;"" and 3) increase the number of students with desirable CVD risk factor status based on national pediatric guidelines. Secondary goals include promoting school staff and parent support for heart health to help children achieve their goals and providing experiential and service learning for MSU health professions students for academic credit . METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot effectiveness study was approved by the MSU IRB. At the beginning and end of the school year, students undergo a CVD risk factor assessment conducted by MSU medical students and graduate students. Key components of the intervention include eight lesson plans (conducted every other month) designed to promote heart-healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors conducted by physical education teachers with the assistance of MSU dietetics and kinesiology students (Spartners ). The last 10 minutes of each lesson, MSU Spartners conduct small group discussions/breakdowns with 5th grade students. In addition, each Spartner case manages/counsels two to three fifth grade students using a web-based goal-setting and tracking protocol throughout the school year. DISCUSSION: This document describes the rationale, development, and methods of the Spartners for Heart Health program. This is a multi-tiered intervention designed to promote heart-healthy behaviors and prevent or control CVD risk factors in children. We believe that this will be a viable sustainable intervention that can be disseminated and adopted by other institutions with minimal cost by involving university students as an integral part of the measurement and intervention teams.",0,0,

13,100 apples divided by 15 red herrings: a mid-nineteenth-century warning about comparing hospital mortality rates,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially compared to provincial facilities. She buttressed this claim with statistics published in the William Fair Registrar General's report, which stated that 24 London hospitals had mortality rates above 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr had calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died throughout the year by the number of patients hospitalized in a single day. When calculated as the annual number of deaths divided by the total number of patients hospitalized during the year, the mortality rate for London hospitals was 10%. A raucous debate broke out in the London medical press over the best way to calculate hospital mortality rates. Critics claimed that Farr had not adjusted for differences in disease severity between urban and rural hospitals and that his figures would mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale, in turn, criticized the poor quality of the hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics intended to compare the quality of providers.",0,0,

15,2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Treatment Guideline: Paradigm Shifts in Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Management,"The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on Blood Cholesterol Management to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major change from previous cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several important paradigm shifts, including: targeting ASCVD risk reduction rather than targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based statin doses as first-line therapy, and using a new risk calculator and risk cutoff to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion in the medical community, with some doctors hesitant to accept the change. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these important changes, compare them to other important lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to lower the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",0,0,
16,2015 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats,"RATIONALE: Strong advances in pain management for companion animals support the decision by the American Association of Animal Hospitals (AAHA) and the American Association of Feline Physicians (AAFP) to expand on the information provided in the Guidelines for Pain Management 2007 AAHA/AAFP Pain Guidelines. The 2015 Guidelines summarize and provide a detailed review of much of this new knowledge. RELEVANCE: Pain management is critical to veterinary practice as it relieves pain, improves patient outcomes, and improves both quality of life and the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. These Guidelines help veterinarians incorporate pain management into practice, improving patient care. APPROACHES: The treatment of pain requires continuous care that includes anticipation, early intervention and evaluation of the response in each patient. A team-oriented approach, including the owner, is essential to maximize recognition, prevention, and treatment of pain in animals. EVIDENCE BASE: The Guidelines include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities to control pain; they are evidence-based to the extent possible and represent a consensus of expert opinion. Behavior changes are currently the main indicator of pain and its course of improvement or progression, and the basis for recently validated pain scores. Post-surgical pain is eminently predictable, but there is strong evidence supporting strategies to mitigate adaptive and maladaptive forms. Chronic pain is dominated by degenerative joint disease (DJD), which is one of the most significant and underdiagnosed diseases of cats and dogs. DJD is ubiquitous, found in pets of all ages, and inevitably progresses over time;"" Evidence-based strategies for management are established in dogs and emerge in cats.",0,0,
17,5As Team obesity intervention in primary care: development and evaluation of weight control tools for shared decision making,"Despite various clinical practice guidelines, a considerable gap remains in the prevention and management of obesity in primary care. To address the need to change provider behavior, a randomized controlled trial with a convergent mixed-method evaluation, the 5As Team (5AsT) study, was conducted. As part of the 5AsT intervention, the 5AsT Toolkit was developed. This document describes the process of developing and evaluating these tools. The tools were developed jointly by the multidisciplinary research team and the 5AsT, which included registered nurses/nurse practitioners (n = 15), mental health workers (n = 7), and registered dietitians (n = 7), who were previously assigned randomized to the 5AST intervention group in a primary care network in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The development of the 5AsT tool occurred through an iterative, need-based, and practice/implementation-oriented process during collaborative 5AsT intervention learning sessions. Feedback during the development of the tool was received through field notes and the final evaluation of the provider was carried out through anonymous questionnaires. Twelve tools were developed in conjunction with 5AsT. All tools were rated as ""most useful"" or ""moderately useful"" in primary care practice by the 5AsT. Four key findings during the development of the 5AsT tool were the need for: tools that are adaptable, tools to facilitate interdisciplinary practice, tools to help patients understand realistic expectations for weight loss, and shared decision-making tools for goal setting and relapse prevention. The 5AsT tools are primary care tools that extend the utility of the 5A obesity management framework in clinical practice.",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING Six Australian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to 24 acute wards during the trial period. INTERVENTIONS Participating wards were randomly assigned to receive either the nurse-led 6-PACK program or usual care for 12 months. The 6-PACK program included a falls risk tool and individualized use of one or more of six interventions: ""fall alert"" signal, monitoring patients in the bathroom, ensuring that patients' walking aids within reach, a regimen for toileting, use of a low-low bed, and use of a bed/chair alarm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Co-primary outcomes were falls and fall injuries per 1000 occupied bed days. RESULTS During the trial, there were 46,245 admissions to 16 medical and eight surgical wards. As many people were admitted more than once, this represented 31,411 individual patients. Patient characteristics and length of stay were similar for the intervention and control wards. Use of the 6-PACK program components was higher in intervention rooms than in control rooms (incidence rate ratio 3.05, 95% confidence interval 2.14 to 4.34""; P< In total, 1831 falls and 613 fall injuries occurred, and the rates of falls (incidence rate ratio 1.04, 0.78 to 1.37; P = 0.796) and fall injuries (0.96 , 0.72 to 1.27; ""P = 0.766) were similar in the intervention and control rooms. CONCLUSIONS Positive changes in fall prevention practice occurred after the introduction of the 6-PACK program. However, no differences in falls or fall injuries were observed between the groups.

20,vision of poverty from behavioral economics,"Standard poverty theory falls into two camps. Behaviors of the economically disadvantaged are considered by social scientists to be calculated adaptations to prevailing circumstances or to emanate from a unique ""culture of poverty"" riddled with deviant values. The first field assumes that people are highly rational, that they hold coherent and justified beliefs, and that they pursue their goals effectively, without error, and without needing help. The second camp attributes to the poor a variety of psychological and attitudinal deficiencies that make their views often wrong and their choices fallible, leaving them in need of paternalistic guidance. We propose a third vision. We argue that the behavioral patterns of the poor may not be perfectly calculating or especially deviant. Rather, the poor may exhibit the same basic weaknesses and biases as people in other walks of life, except that in poverty, with its narrow margins of error, the same behaviors are often more pronounced and can lead to to worse results. In what follows, we illustrate the kinds of insights that can be gained from a more behaviorally realistic analysis of the economic conditions of the poor, and propose that alternative policies",0,0,

This case report details the challenges to large-scale CI evaluation and proposes solutions that are based on an adaptive study design. Study design We used two sequential evaluation methods to study a QI effort to improve the delivery of HIV preventive care in public health facilities in three districts of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 3-year period. We initially used a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Main findings During the study period of the RCT, tensions arose between intervention implementation and evaluation design due to loss of integrity of the randomisation unit over time, pressure to implement changes in the randomisation unit and the use of administrative rather than functional structures for randomisation. In response to this loss of design integrity, we switched to a more flexible intervention design and mixed-methods quasi-experimental evaluation that relies on both qualitative and quantitative interrupted time-series analysis. Conclusions Cluster RCT designs may not be optimal for evaluating complex interventions to improve implementation in uncontrolled 'real world' settings. More flexible and context-sensitive evaluation designs offer a better balance of the need to adjust the intervention during evaluation to meet implementation challenges while providing the data needed to assess effectiveness. Our case study involved HIV care in a resource-limited setting, but these issues are likely to apply to complex improvement interventions in other settings.",0,0,
25,centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve adherence to guidelines in private primary care practices,"BACKGROUND: Many large health systems now employ clinical pharmacists in care teams to help patients and physicians with the management of cardiovascular (CV) disease. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to assess whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (HRQoL) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve guideline adherence in primary care physician offices in rural and small communities. METHODS: This study is a prospective randomized cluster trial in 12 primary care practices. Physician offices were randomly assigned to the HRQoL intervention or usual care. The intervention will have a duration of 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at the beginning and at 12 months. Primary outcomes will include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be extracted from the clinical history at 30 months to determine if the effect of the intervention is maintained after stopping it.

However, given the limited range of clinical settings in which they have been tested, such systems need to be rigorously evaluated before their widespread introduction into clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the presentation of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines through a CDSS increases the proportion of appropriate clinical practice decisions. DESIGN: Time-series study conducted between December 1997 and July 1999. SETTING: Department of orthopedic surgery at a university hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1971 patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. INTERVENTION: A CDSS designed to provide immediate information related to the prevention of venous thromboembolism was integrated into daily medical practice among surgical patients during three 10-week intervention periods, alternated with four 10-week control periods, with a 4-week washout. weeks between each period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of appropriate prescriptions ordered for anticoagulation, according to pre-established clinical guidelines, during intervention versus control periods. RESULTS: Physicians complied with guidelines in 82.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.6%-87.1%) of cases during the control periods and in 94.9% (95% CI, 92.5%-96.6%) of cases during the intervention periods.

28,clinically integrated postgraduate training program in evidence-based medicine versus 'no intervention' to improve disability assessments: a cluster randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have shown that EBM teaching is effective in improving knowledge, there is currently no convincing evidence that EBM teaching also changes professional behavior in practice. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a clinically integrated postgraduate training program in EBM in evidence-based disability assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, fifty-four case-based learning groups consisting of 132 physicians and 1680 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group was provided with a 5-day postgraduate clinically integrated training program in evidence-based medicine, consisting of homework (at home), peer teaching, interactive training in database searching, lectures, and brainstorming sessions. The control group received no training. The primary outcome was evidence-based disability assessment, as indicated by frequency of use of evidence of sufficient quality in disability assessment reports. There are no general behavioral outcome measures of EBM available. Therefore, we follow general guidelines to construct performance indicators and define an a priori cut-off point to determine sufficient quality as recommended for evaluating EB training. EBM-trained clinicians performed more evidence-based disability assessments compared with clinicians in the control group (difference in absolute proportion 9.7%, 95% CI 3.5 to 15.9). Differences in primary outcomes between groups remained significant after cluster-adjusted analysis and additional sensitivity analyzes that accounted for subject loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: An EBM program successfully improved the use of evidence in a nonhospital medical specialty. Our findings support general recommendations to use multiple educational methods to change physician behavior. In addition, it seemed important that the professional context of the intervention was very supportive in that database searches, use and application of guidelines and other forms of evidence are considered standard practice and are encouraged by colleagues. and management.",0,0,

SETTING: The study setting was a general internal medicine clinic at a university-affiliated county hospital serving the Seattle metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50 to 74 years with at least one routine clinic appointment (when due for mammography) during the study period (n=314) were enrolled in the trial. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention program emphasized nursing involvement and included medical education, provider directions, use of audio-visual and print patient education materials, transportation assistance in the form of bus passes, pre-appointment telephone or postcard reminders and rescheduling assistance. Women in the control company received usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Completion of mammography within 8 weeks of clinic visits was significantly higher among operated women (49%) than firm control women (22%) (p < 0.001). These effects persisted after adjustment for potential confounders of age, race, health insurance coverage, and previous experience with mammography in the hospital (odds ratio 3.5: 95% confidence interval 1.9, 6.5). The effect of the intervention was modified by the type of insurance coverage, as well as by history of previous mammograms. The process evaluation indicated that bus passes and rescheduling efforts did not contribute to the observed increases in participation in controls. CONCLUSIONS: A clinic-based program that incorporates physician education, provider directions, patient education materials, and appointment reminders and that emphasizes nursing involvement may facilitate breast cancer screening adherence among women.

30,cluster randomized controlled trial of the clinical and economic efficacy of a 'whole systems' model of self-management support for the management of long-term illness in primary care: trial protocol,"Background Patients with long-term conditions are increasingly the focus of quality improvement activities in health services to reduce the impact of these conditions on quality of life and to reduce the burden on care utilization. . There is significant interest in the potential of self-management support to improve health and reduce utilization in these patient populations, but there is little consensus on the optimal model that would best provide such support. We describe the implementation and evaluation of self-care support through an evidence-based ""whole systems"" model that includes patient support, training of primary care teams, and service reorganization, all integrated into the routine provision within primary care. Methods The evaluation involves a large-scale, multi-site study of the implementation, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of this self-management support model using a cluster randomized controlled trial in patients with three long-term conditions of diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Outcome measures include healthcare utilization and quality of life. We describe the methods of the cluster randomized trial. Discussion If the 'whole systems' model proves to be effective and cost-effective, it will provide decision-makers with a model for the delivery of self-management support for populations with long-term conditions that can be widely implemented to maximize 'reach' through of the broader patient population.",0,0,
31,cluster randomized clinical trial to improve prescription patterns in pediatric outpatients.,"Objectives Having previously shown that an electronic prescription writer and decision support system improved pediatric prescribing behavior for otitis media in an academic clinical setting, we assessed whether point-of-care evidence delivery could demonstrate effects. similar for a wide range of other common pediatric conditions. . Cluster randomized controlled trial design. Setting A teaching clinic/clinical practice site and a primary care pediatric clinic serving a mix of rural and semi-urban patients. Participants A total of 36 providers at the teaching clinic/practice site and eight providers at the private primary pediatric clinic. Intervention An evidence-based messaging system that presented real-time evidence to providers based on prescribing practices for acute otitis media, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, constipation, pharyngitis, croup, urticaria, and bronchiolitis. Outcome measures The proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with the evidence. Results The proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with the evidence improved four percentage points, from 38% at baseline to 42% after the intervention. The control group improved by one percentage point, from 39% at baseline to 40% at the end of the trial. The adjusted difference between the intervention and control groups was 8% (95% confidence interval, 1%, 15%). The effectiveness of the intervention did not decrease over time. Conclusion For common pediatric outpatient conditions, an evidence-based prescription writer and point-of-care decision support system was associated with significant improvements in prescribing practices.",1,1,
32,cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at implementing local quality improvement collaborations to improve prescribing and test ordering performance of general practitioners: study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The use of guidelines in general practice is not optimal. Although there are evidence-based methods to improve adherence to guidelines, variation in physician adherence to general practice guidelines remains relatively high. The objective of this study is to transfer to the field a quality improvement strategy based on auditing, feedback, educational materials and peer discussion moderated by local opinion leaders. The research questions are: is the large-scale multifaceted strategy implemented as planned?""; what is the effect on the prescribing and test-ordering behavior of general practitioners (GPs)?""; And what are the costs of implementing the strategy? METHODS: In order to assess the effects, costs, and feasibility of this new strategy, we planned a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a balanced incomplete block design. Local GP groups in the southern Netherlands who already participate in pharmacotherapeutic audit meeting groups will be recruited by regional health officials. Approximately 50 groups of GPs will be randomly assigned to two arms. These GPs will be offered two different balanced sets of clinical topics. Each GP within a group will receive comparative feedback on test ordering and prescription performance. Feedback will be discussed in the group and working agreements will be created after discussion of guidelines and barriers to change. Data for feedback will be collected from existing and newly formed databases, both at the start and after one year. DISCUSSION: We are not aware of published studies on the successes and failures of attempts to transfer to stakeholders in the field a multifaceted strategy targeting GPs' prescribing and test-ordering behavior. This pragmatic study will focus on compatibility with existing infrastructure, while allowing a degree of adaptation to local needs and routines.",0,0,
33,Cluster-Randomized Trial of Standard Quality Improvement Versus Patient-Centered Interventions to Improve Depression Care for African Americans in the Primary Care Setting: Study Protocol NCT00243425,"BACKGROUND: Several studies document disparities in access to care and quality of care for depression in African Americans. Research suggests that patients' attitudes and physicians' communication behaviors may contribute to these disparities. Evidence links patient-centered care with improvements in mental health outcomes"";"" therefore, quality improvement interventions that improve this dimension of care are promising strategies for improving depression treatment and outcomes among African Americans. This article describes the design of the BRIDGE (Blacks Receiver Interventions for Depression and Gaining Empowerment) study. The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions for African-American patients with depression: a standard quality improvement program and a patient-centered quality improvement program. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered group will have a greater reduction in their symptoms of depression, higher rates of remission from depression, and greater improvements in mental health functioning at six, twelve, and eighteen months than patients in the standard group. The study also examines patients' assessments of their care and receipt of guideline-based treatment for depression. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 36 primary care physicians and 132 of their African American patients with major depressive disorder were recruited in a cluster randomized trial. The study uses intention-to-treat analyzes to compare the effectiveness of standard quality improvement interventions (academic details on depression guidelines for clinicians and disease-oriented care management for their patients) and patient-centered quality improvement (training in communication skills to improve participation). decision making for physicians and care management focused on explanatory models, sociocultural barriers, and treatment preferences for their patients) to improve outcomes during 12-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: The BRIDGE study includes African American physicians and patients in low-resource community practices who have not been well represented in clinical trials to improve depression care. The patient-centered, culturally driven approach to depression care is relatively new and has not been tested in most previous studies. The study will provide evidence on whether patient-centered accommodations improve quality of care and outcomes to a greater extent than standard quality improvement strategies for African Americans with depression.

34,Combined location alert and web-based tool change clinician behavior and shorten length of hospital stay in acute pancreatitis,"OBJECTIVES: There are many published clinical guidelines for acute pancreatitis (AP). The implementation of these recommendations is variable. We hypothesized that a clinical decision support (CDS) tool would change physician behavior and shorten length of hospital stay (LOS). METHODS: DESIGN/SETTING: Observational study, titled The AP Early Response (TAPER) Project. Emergency department (ED) and hospital of a tertiary center. PARTICIPANTS: Two consecutive samples of patients with ICD-9 code (577.0) were generated for PC emergency department (ED) or hospital admissions. The diagnosis of PA was based on the conventional Atlanta criteria. The Pre-TAPER-CDS-Tool group (5/30/06-6/22/07) had 110 patients presenting to the ED with AP by 976 ICD-9 (577.0) codes and the Post-TAPER-CDS group -Tool (5/30/06-6/22/07) had 113 by 907 ICD-9 codes (7/14/10-5/5/11). INTERVENTION: The TAPER-CDS tool, developed between 12/2008 and 7/14/2010, is a combined automated early pager alert system that sends text messages to emergency physicians about a patient with PA and an intuitive web-based point of contact. -Instrument of attention, composed of seven recommendations for early management. RESULTS: The groups before and after TAPER-CDS-Tool had similar baseline characteristics. The post-TAPER-CDS-Tool group met two management goals more often than the pre-TAPER-CDS-Tool group: risk stratification (P6L/1st 0-24h (P=0.0003). The mean (sd) of hospital LOS was significantly shorter in the post-TAPER-CDS-Tool group (4.6 (3.1) vs. 6.7 (7.0) days, P = 0.0126). Multivariate analysis identified four independent variables for hospital stay: TAPER-CDS tool associated with shorter stay (P = 0.0049) and three variables associated with longer LOS: Japanese Severity Score (P = 0.0361), persistent organ failure (P = 0.0088) and local pancreatic complications (<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The TAPER-CDS tool is associated with changed physician behavior and shortened hospital duration, which has significant financial implications.",0,0,

36,A community approach to the promotion of breastfeeding in Mexico,"comprehensive education strategy is presented that links training, community education, research, and media efforts to improve breastfeeding practices. Breastfeeding promotion models, an administrative system, and lessons learned during the project are described. The keys to effective breastfeeding promotion have been shown to be accurate information""; appropriate education, training, and follow-up; and a supportive administrative system""; PIP: An operations research project designed to determine which intervention model was most successful in promoting breastfeeding among 585 urban women in Mexico began in 1986. mothers in Chihuahua, and both trained promoters and program supervisors train individuals or groups in Cuauhtémoc. Jalapa served as the control site. The breastfeeding prevalence rate in the 4 communities ranged from 64.5% to 81.3% before the intervention, with a mean in the target group of 74.9%. The mean rose to 88.8% for this group after the intervention. In addition, the breastfeeding prevalence rate in Jalapa fell from 65.9% to 56%. In addition, 70% of the women in the experimental group exclusively breastfed their children during the first month, while only 63.3% in the control group did so. Breastfeeding prevalence rates in subsequent months decreased by 13.7% and 14.7% (5 months) and 9.4% and 3.3% (6 months) in the experimental and control groups , respectively. Informal support groups of breastfeeding mothers unexpectedly formed as a result of the educational and outreach activities. The data showed that the intervention model with promoters was the most successful strategy. They also provided guidelines for researchers and other health professionals interested in promoting community breastfeeding programs. For example, supervisors should not discourage promoters from addressing other community needs, as discouraging them may jeopardize their dedication to breastfeeding promotion. In addition, program planners must collect geographic and sociodemographic data on the area and population prior to planning and intervention.",0,0,
37,comparison of the effects of computer and manual reminders on adherence to a mental health clinical practice guideline.,"Objective: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of computerized and manual reminder systems in the implementation of a clinical practice guideline. Design: Seventy-eight outpatients in a mental health clinic were randomly assigned within the clinician to one of two recall systems. The computer system, called CaseWalker, reminded physicians when to perform the guideline-recommended screening for mood disorders, ensured fidelity of the diagnosis of major depressive disorder to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mood Disorders. Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), and generated a progress note. The manual system was a checklist inserted into the paper medical record. MEASURES: Rates of screening for mood disorder and completeness of documentation of DSM-IV criteria met by patients said to have major depressive disorder were compared. Results: The CaseWalker, compared to the paper checklist, resulted in a higher detection rate for mood disorders (86.5% vs. 61%, P = 0.008) and a higher detection rate for mood disorders. full documentation of DSM-IV criteria (100 vs. 5.6%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In a mental health outpatient clinic, computerized reminders were shown to be superior to manual reminders in improving adherence to a clinical practice guideline for depression.",0,1,
38,computer-based intervention to improve the adequacy of antiepileptic drug level monitoring,"Designed and implemented 2 automated computer screens for use at antiepileptic drug (AED) test order entry to improve appropriateness by reminding clinicians when a potentially redundant test was ordered and provide common prompts for monitoring and pharmacokinetics of the specific AED. All computerized orders for serum AED levels from hospitalized patients during two 3-month periods were included in the study. During the 3-month period after implementation of the automated intervention, 13% of all AED tests ordered were canceled following computerized reminders. For orders that seemed redundant, the cancellation rate was 27%. For non-redundant orders, 4% were canceled when information on pharmacokinetics and AED-specific monitoring was provided. The cancellation rate was maintained after 4 years. There has been a 19.5% decrease in the total volume of AED tests since the implementation of this intervention, despite a 19.3% increase in the overall volume of chemical tests. Inadequacy due to repeated testing before reaching pharmacological steady state decreased from 54% of all AED orders to 14.6%. A simple, automated, activity-based intervention targeting specific test requesting behavior effectively reduced inappropriate laboratory testing. The sustained benefit supports the idea that computerized interventions can lastingly affect physician behavior. Computerized delivery of such evidence-based limit guidelines can help bridge the gap between evidence and practice.",1,1,
39,portable computerized decision support system to improve the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a randomized trial.,"Background: Pulmonary embolism tests often differ from those recommended by evidence-based guidelines. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a portable clinical decision support system to improve the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism in emergency department patients. Design: Randomized cluster trial. Allocation was by random number table, providers were not blinded, and outcome assessment was automated. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00188032) Setting: 20 emergency departments in France. Patients: 1103 and 1768 consecutive outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Intervention: After a pre-intervention period involving 20 centers and 1,103 patients, in which providers became accustomed to entering clinical data on handheld devices and investigators evaluated baseline tests, emergency departments were randomly assigned to activation of a decision support system in the devices (10 centers, 753 patients) or posters and pocket cards showing validated diagnostic strategies (10 centers, 1015 patients). Measurements: Appropriateness of diagnostic evaluation, defined as any sequence of tests that yielded a post-test probability of less than 5% or greater than 85% (primary outcome) or strict adherence to guideline recommendations (secondary outcome)"" number of tests per patient (secondary outcome).Results: The proportion of patients who received appropriate diagnostic tests was greater during the trial than in the pre-intervention period in both groups, but the increase was greater in the guideline-based group. (increasing adjusted mean difference, 19.3 percentage points in favor of computer-based guidelines [95% CI, 2.9 to 35.6 percentage points]; P = 0.023).Among patients with adequate assessments , those in the computer-based guidelines group received slightly fewer tests than patients in the paper-based guidelines group (mean tests per patient, 1.76 [SD, 0.98] vs. 2.25 [SD, 1, 04] ;"" PÃ‚ < 0.001).

40,computerized intervention to decrease the use of calcium channel blockers in hypertension.,"Objective To determine if a computer-assisted reminder would modify the prescription habits for the treatment of hypertension according to current clinical guidelines in a general internal medicine consultation. Design A randomized trial. Setting The Puget Sound Veterans Affairs Health Care System General Internal Medicine Clinic, Seattle Division. Patients/Participants Clinic providers were randomized to a control group (n=35) or intervention group (n=36). We are targeting providers of patients treated for hypertension with calcium channel blockers, a class of medication that is not recommended for initial therapy. Intervention An automated computer query identified eligible patients and their providers. A guideline reminder was placed in intervention providers' patient charts"";"" patient charts from control providers did not receive any reminders. Measurements and main results During the 5-month study period, 346 patients were seen by the 36 primary care providers (staff physicians, nurse practitioners, residents, and fellows) in the intervention group, and 373 patients were seen by the 35 providers in the intervention group. control group. Intervention providers switched 39 patients (11.3%) to other medications during the study period, compared to 1 patient (<1.0%) from control providers (p < 0.0001). For patients whose therapy did not change, providers noted angina in 23.1%, indications other than hypertension in 9.5%, adverse effects intolerable with first-line therapy in 13.9%, and inadequate control with first-line therapy in 13.9%. Of those patients without provider-indicated contraindications, 23.6% switched from calcium channel blockers to first-line agents during the intervention period. Conclusions The use of a computerized clinical intervention increased adherence to guidelines in the treatment of primary hypertension in general and decreased the use of calcium channel blockers for the treatment of hypertension in particular.",1,1,
41,computerized reminder for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in surgical patients,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of a computerized reminder system on the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in surgical patients. DESIGN: A prospective trial to measure change in compliance compared to historical controls. MEASUREMENTS: Surgeons at LDS Hospital developed a local consensus on which procedures should have DVT prophylaxis. The historical rate of prophylaxis for procedures was measured through a database search of patient records. A computerized reminder system was then implemented that used an expert knowledge base and a time control mechanism to flag surgical cases for DVT prophylaxis. For eligible patients, a DVT reminder appeared in the operating room schedule"";"" the surgical staff used this as a guide to apply prophylaxis. During the 3-month trial, the rate of DVT prophylaxis was remeasured and compared with the pre-intervention rate. RESULTS: The pre-intervention rate of DVT prophylaxis over a 3-month period was 85.2% (785 of 921 eligible cases). During the 3 months after the introduction of the computerized reminder, compliance with DVT prophylaxis increased to 99.3% (1,084 of 1,092 eligible cases). The difference between historical controls and study subjects was highly significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A computerized reminder is an effective method to increase the rate of DVT prophylaxis in surgical patients.",1,1,
42,computerized reminder system to increase the use of inpatient preventive care,"BACKGROUND Although effective in outpatient settings, computerized reminders have not been shown to increase preventive care in inpatient settings. METHODS We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of computerized reminders on the rates at which four inpatient preventive therapies were ordered. During an 18-month study period, a computerized system processed online information from 6,371 patients admitted to a general medicine service (for a total of 10,065 hospitalizations), generating preventive care reminders as appropriate. Physicians in the intervention group saw these reminders when they were using a computerized inpatient order entry system. RESULTS The reminder system identified 3,416 patients (53.6 percent) as eligible for preventive measures that had not been ordered by the admitting physician. For patients with at least one indication, computerized reminders resulted in higher adjusted rates of requesting pneumococcal vaccination (35.8% of patients in the intervention group vs. 0.8% of those in the control group, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (51.4% 1.0%, P<0.001), prophylactic heparin (32.2% vs. 18.9%, P<0.001), and prophylactic aspirin at discharge (36, 4% vs. 27.6%, P<0.001).

43,"concept for the implementation and evaluation of the guideline ""Early detection of breast cancer in Germany""","Systematically developed, evidence-based, and consensus-based guidelines are important tools for improving health care services. The effectiveness of a guideline is not only related to its methodological quality but also to the implementation strategy used. The following article describes the systematic development of a strategy to implement and evaluate the guideline ""Early detection of breast cancer in Germany"" as part of a national project. A multifaceted systematic implementation strategy has been developed that addresses existing barriers and builds on projects that were recently introduced in Germany to improve early detection and treatment of breast cancer. The goal is to induce behavioral changes in women as health care recipients and in physicians as health care providers, both involved in the medical decision-making process within the scope of the guideline. In addition, it supports organizational changes to ensure compliance with the guideline through quality assurance and quality management. To ensure the evaluation of the implementation process, a set of quality indicators has been identified for the baseline evaluation of the structures, the performance of the providers and the results. Both the effectiveness of the implementation process and the effectiveness of the guideline itself will be measured using the same set of indicators for re-evaluation within a pre-defined time interval of 18 months. The quasi-experimental design of this uncontrolled pre-post implementation study described in this paper allows for the assessment of clinically relevant changes using quality indicators that measure the effectiveness of the guideline at the national level.",0,0,
44,controlled trial of symptom data inclusion in computer-based care suggestions for the management of patients with chronic heart failure,"Background Heart failure is common and associated with considerable morbidity and cost, but adherence to treatment guidelines by physicians is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized controlled study to determine whether adding information about symptoms to evidence-based, computer-generated suggestions for care would affect treatment decisions among primary care physicians caring for outpatients with heart failure at two medical centers in the United States. Veterans Affairs. Methods Physicians were randomly assigned to receive care suggestions generated using electronic medical record data and symptom data obtained from questionnaires mailed to patients within 2 weeks of scheduled outpatient visits (intervention group) or suggestions generated only with data from electronic medical records (control group). Patients had to have a diagnosis of heart failure and objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We assessed physician adherence to heart failure guidelines, as well as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, quality of life, satisfaction with care, hospitalizations and outpatient visits, 6 and 12 months after enrollment. Results Patients in the intervention (n = 355) and control (n = 365) groups were similar at baseline. At 12 months, there was no significant difference in adherence to care suggestions between physicians in the intervention and control groups (33% vs. 30%, p=0.4). There were also no significant changes in NYHA class (P = 0.1) and quality of life measures (P > 0.1), as well as no differences in the number of outpatient visits between intervention and control patients ( 6.7 vs. 7.1 visits, P = 0.48). Intervention patients were more satisfied with their physicians (P = 0.02) and primary care visit (P = 0.02), but had more all-cause hospitalizations at 6 months (1.5 vs. 0.7 hospitalizations, P = 0.0002) and at 12 months (2.3 vs. 1.7 hospitalizations, P = 0.05).

45,controlled trial of web-based diabetes disease control.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of a web-based decision support tool, the Diabetic Disease Management Application (DMA), developed to improve evidence-based management of type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS FROM THE RESEARCH: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of 12 intervention and 14 control staff providers and 307 intervention and 291 control patients with type 2 diabetes in a hospital internal medicine clinic. Providers were randomly assigned from May 1998 to April 1999 to have access to the DMA (intervention) or no access (control). The DMA displays interactive patient-specific clinical data, treatment tips, and links to other web-based care resources. We compared patients in the intervention and control groups for changes in care processes and outcomes from the year before the study to the year of the study using intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: DMA was used in 42% of scheduled patient visits. The number of HbA1c tests obtained per year was significantly increased in the intervention group (+0.3 tests/year) compared with the control group (-0.04 tests/year, P = 0.008), as was the number of LDL cholesterol tests (intervention, +0.2 tests/year""; control, +0.01 tests/year; P = 0.02) and the proportions of patients who underwent at least one foot exam per year (intervention, +9.8%; control, -0.7%; P = .003).HbA1c levels decreased by 0.2 in the intervention group and increased by 0.1 in the control group (P = 0.09);"" the proportions of patients with LDL cholesterol levels <130 mg/dL increased by 20.3% in the intervention group and 10.5% in the control group (P = 0.5).

46,cross-sectional study of the number and frequency of terms used to refer to knowledge translation in a body of health literature in 2006: a Tower of Babel?,"The study of the implementation of research results in practice is growing rapidly and has acquired many competing names (eg dissemination, acceptance, utilization, translation) and contributing disciplines. The use of multiple terms across disciplines poses barriers to communication and progress in applying research results. We attempted to establish an inventory of terms that describe this field and how often authors use them in a collection of health literature published in 2006. Methods We refer to this field as knowledge translation (KT). Terms describing aspects of KT and their definitions were collected from the literature, the Internet, reports, textbooks, and contact with experts. We compiled a database of KT and other articles by reading 12 health journals representing multiple disciplines. All articles published in these journals in 2006 were categorized as KT or not. KT articles (all KT articles) were further classified, if possible, by describing KT projects or implementations (KT application articles), or presenting the theoretical basis, models, tools, methods, or KT techniques (KT theory articles). Accuracy was checked by duplicate reading. Custom-designed software determined how often KT terms were used in the titles and abstracts of articles categorized as KT. Results A total of 2,603 articles were evaluated and 581 were identified as KT articles. Of these, 201 described KT applications and 153 included KT theory. Of the 100 KT terms collected, 46 were used by the authors in the titles or abstracts of articles categorized as KT. For the 581 KT articles, eight terms or variations of terms used by the authors were highly discriminating in separating KT and non-KT articles (p < 0.001): implementation, adoption, quality improvement, diffusion, complex intervention (with multiple endings) , implementation (within three words of) research and complex intervention. More KT terms were associated with KT application articles (n = 13) and KT theory articles (n = 18). Conclusions We compiled 100 terms that describe KT research. The authors used 46 of them in titles and abstracts of KT articles. Of these, about half discriminated between KT and non-KT items. Therefore, the need for consolidation and consistent use of fewer terms related to KT research is evident.",0,0,
47,formative study of colon cancer surveillance care: implications for survivor-centered interventions.,"Colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the United States, and a growing number of survivors have stressed the need for improved quality of colon cancer surveillance care. Post-treatment surveillance includes follow-up care visits and tests, as well as psychosocial support and lifestyle advice. This formative study explored individual, interpersonal, and organizational factors related to adherence to surveillance care guidelines to identify modifiable factors for potential educational intervention strategies. A convenience sample of 22 survivors (12 women and 10 men) from two cancer centers was recruited to participate in focus group or key informant telephone interviews to explore their experiences with care after completing treatment and to complete a short survey. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results confirmed that survivors navigated a complex follow-up care schedule and described a strong trust in their health care providers that guided their follow-up care experiences. Participants defined the terms ""survival"" and ""follow-up"" in a variety of different ways. Critical individual-level themes for survivors' experiences included having a positive attitude, trusting one's faith, and coping with fears. Interpersonal-level topics focused on interactions and communication with family and health care providers in follow-up care. While organizational-level factors were infrequently highlighted, participants rated office reminder systems and communication between their multiple vendors as valuable. Educational interventions that build on survivors' connections with their doctors and focus on preparing survivors for what to expect in the next phase of their cancer experience could be beneficial at the end of treatment to energize survivors for the transition to the post-treatment period.",0,0,
48,framework of good practices in inter-institutional interventions with cases of self-neglect,"Self-neglect is probably more common than generally thought and gives rise to a number of difficult conceptual, identification and intervention problems for health and social care workers. These patient management issues are compounded by the lack of an evidence base for practice on which nurses can draw when faced with managing people who neglect themselves. Nurses working with self-neglecting people operate in an interdisciplinary context that includes professional groups, such as environmental health officers, who are not typically part of health and social care teams. In the absence of such an evidence base, a pragmatic solution has been proposed in the form of a framework for inter-institutional practice. This document briefly describes the background behind this framework, including a research study of self-abandoned housing and interagency responses.",0,0,
49,framework to help healthcare professionals recommend high-quality apps to support chronic disease self-management: an illustrative assessment of apps for type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: This paper presents an approach to help healthcare professionals recommend high-quality apps to support chronic disease self-management. Most app reviews focus on popularity, aesthetics, functionality, usability, and quality of information. There is no doubt that these factors are important in selecting reliable applications that are attractive to users, but behavioral theory can also be useful in tailoring applications to users' needs. OBJECTIVE: The developed framework aims to be methodologically sound, capable of selecting popular apps that include content covered by evidence-based programs, consistent with behavioral theory, as well as a patient-centered approach to matching apps with needs. individual of the patients. METHODS: A single disease, type 2 diabetes, was selected to illustrate how the framework can be applied, as it was thought to represent the types of strategies used in many chronic diseases. A systematic approach based on behavioral theory and best practice guideline recommendations was developed to tailor applications to patient needs. In March 2014, a series of search strategies were used to identify the best health apps for iPhone and Android, representing 29 topics from five categories of type 2 diabetes self-management strategies. Topics were chosen from international guidelines published for the control of diabetes. The lead author (KH) evaluated the most popular apps found addressing these topics using the Behavioral Theory Content Survey (BTS), which is based on traditional behavioral theory. A tool to aid decision making when using applications with healthcare professionals was developed and tested for ease of use and understanding. RESULTS: A total of 14 apps representing the five categories of self-management topics were evaluated. Total theoretical scores (BTS scores) were less than 50 on a 100-point scale for all applications. Each app scored less than 50% of the total possible BTS score for all four behavioral theories and for most of the 20 behavioral strategies"";"" however, apps scored greater than 50% of the total possible BTS score for specific strategies related to their primary focus. Our findings suggest that the apps studied would be more effective when used in conjunction with therapy than as stand-alone apps. The applications were classified according to the topic and the main intervention strategies. A framework was developed to match apps to identified patient needs based on app categorization and principles of patient-centered care. The approach was well accepted and understood by a convenience sample of health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The presented framework can be used by health professionals to better tailor applications to clients' needs. Some applications incorporate highly interactive strategies from behavioral theory and, when used as an adjunct, can increase patient engagement and therapy effectiveness.",0,0,
50,French adaptation of the Overt Behavior Scale (OBS) measuring challenging behaviors after acquired brain injury: The Echelle des comportements observables (ECO),"PURPOSE: To develop a French version of the Overt Behavior Scale (OBS) and to examine some of its psychometric properties. METHODS: The scale was adapted and validated according to the standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of questionnaires (Echelle des comportements observables"";"" ECO). The reliability and construct validity of the ECO were studied among 29 inpatients and outpatients who sustained an acquired brain injury. The instruments were administered by 12 physicians located at eight rehabilitation centers and the local brain injury association. RESULTS: The ECO provided behavioral profile descriptions very similar to the original scale. It showed excellent reliability and good convergent and divergent validity, as reflected by significant associations with other measures containing similar behavioral items and the absence of significant correlations with broader constructs such as physical and cognitive abilities. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the ECO behaves very similarly to the original OBS, has promising initial findings regarding reliability and validity, and is a valuable research and clinical instrument for assessing the severity and typology of challenging behavior. after acquired brain injury and to monitor the evolution of behaviors after intervention in French and bilingual communities.",0,0,
51,portable computer-based smoking intervention tool and its effects on medical advice for smoking cessation,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate a laptop-based smoking cessation intervention tool designed to assist clinicians in their smoking cessation counseling with patients. METHODS: This study used a pre/post survey design, with a 4-month trial period for the software. Study participants included 22 University of Virginia professors and medical residents. Paired samples t-tests were used to assess mean differences on the 4 main subscales (physician behavior, attitudes, comfort related to counseling patients about smoking cessation, and knowledge). RESULTS: No statistically significant mean differences were found for physician behavior (mean increase = 0.44, P = 0.55) or physician attitude (mean increase = 0.44, P = 0.16). A statistically significant mean increase of 2.29 was observed for the physician comfort subscale (t = 3.87, df = 16, P = 0.001). Physicians reported greater comfort in counseling patients about smoking cessation (p = 0.007) and greater comfort in using the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Physician comfort level in counseling patients on smoking cessation can be improved through handheld software. When used in conjunction with other practice modifications, this tool has the potential to improve clinicians' intervention practices for smoking cessation.",0,1,
52,"hybrid cluster-randomized trial of effectiveness-implementation of group CBT for anxiety in urban schools: rationale, design, and methods.","Background Schools present a context with great potential for the implementation of evidence-based psychosocial practices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to be highly effective in treating anxiety in various community settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is an effective group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, evidence-based practices for anxiety are rarely employed in under-resourced urban schools, because many treatment protocols are not appropriate for the urban school setting or population, existing behavioral health staff are not trained o Adequate support to enable them to implement treatment with fidelity, o School districts do not have the resources to hire outside consultants. In our previous work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT protocol for anxiety disorders (CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS)). Methods/Design The objective of this 5-year study is to assess both the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools compared to the original FRIENDS as well as to compare implementation strategies (train the trainer versus train the trainer?+?continuous consultation) by conducting a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial of three parallel groups in 18 urban K-8 public schools. We will also assess profitability and loyalty mediators and moderators. 90 therapists, 18 agency supervisors and 360 children will participate. The Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation guides training and support procedures for therapists and supervisors. Discussion This study has the potential to demonstrate that therapists and agency supervisors who have had little or no prior exposure to evidence-based practices (EBP) can implement EBP for anxiety disorder with fidelity. Comparisons of implementation strategies would provide data to large urban mental health systems to make decisions about EBP adoption.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the adherence and acceptability of two types of diets for diabetes. DESIGN: Controlled trial conducted between 2004 and 2006. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n=99) in a community-based research center. Participants were randomly assigned to a diet following the 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat vegan diet for 74 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attrition, adherence, dietary behavior, diet acceptability, and cravings. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: For nutrient intake and questionnaire scores, t-tests determined differences between groups. For measures of diet acceptability, Wilcoxon's paired-samples rank-sum test assessed within-group changes; independent samples Mann-Whitney U test compared diet groups. Changes in reported symptoms between groups were compared using chi(2) for independent samples RESULTS: All participants completed the initial 22 weeks, 90% (45/50) of the American Association of Dietary Association guidelines diet group Diabetes and 86% (42/49) of the vegan diet group completed 74 weeks. carbohydrate and fiber intake increased more in the vegan group At 22 weeks, 44% (22/50) of members of the American Diabetes Association diet group and 67% (33/49) of vegans met the criteria for adherence to the group-specific diet. -group of participants (P = 0.019); the American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group reported a greater increase in dietary restriction;"" this difference was not significant at 74 weeks.

54,meta-analysis of the association between adherence to drug therapy and mortality,"OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between adherence to pharmacological treatment, including placebo, and mortality. DESIGN Meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases, contact with researchers and adherence textbooks and reviews. Review methods Predefined criteria were used to select studies that reported mortality between participants with good and poor adherence to pharmacological treatment. Data were extracted by disease, pharmacological treatment groups, methods to measure compliance rate, definition of good compliance, and mortality. RESULTS Data were available from 21 studies (46,847 participants), including eight studies with placebo arms (19,633 participants). Compared with poor adherence, good adherence was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.63). Good adherence to placebo was associated with lower mortality (0.56, 0.43 to 0.74), as was good adherence to beneficial pharmacological treatment (0.55, 0.49 to 0.62). Good adherence to harmful pharmacological treatment was associated with higher mortality (2.90, 1.04 to 8.11). CONCLUSION Good adherence to drug therapy is associated with positive health outcomes. In addition, the observed association between good placebo adherence and mortality supports the existence of the ""healthy adherent"" effect, thus adherence to drug therapy may be a surrogate marker of overall healthy behavior.",0,0,
55,midwife-led hospital birthing center within an academic medical center: successes and challenges,"The University of California San Diego Community Women's Health Program (CWHP) has become a successful and sustainable coexistence model of women's health care. The cornerstone of this midwifery practice is California's only hospital birthing center. Located within the medical center, this unique and physically separate birthing center has been the site of more than 4,000 births. With 10% cesarean delivery and 98% breastfeeding rates, it is an exceptional example of low-intervention care. The integration of this previously independent maternity center into an academic center has brought evidence of mistrust and ineffective communication. Education, consistent leadership, and the development of multidisciplinary guidelines helped overcome these challenges. This collaborative model provides a structure in which residents learn to be respectful consultants and appreciate differences in medical practice. The CWHP and its Birthing Center illustrate that through persistence and flexibility, a collaborative model of maternity services can flourish and positively influence not only new families but also future generations of providers.",0,0,
56,"Migraine Management Training Program for Primary Care Providers: An Overview of a Survey and Results of a Pilot Study, Lessons Learned, and Considerations for Future Research","BACKGROUND: There are five to nine million primary care office visits per year for migraine in the United States. However, migraine care is often suboptimal in the primary care setting. An earlier study indicated that primary care physicians (PCPs) wanted direct contact with headache specialists to improve the migraine care they provide. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to further examine PCPs' knowledge of migraine management and assess the feasibility of a multimodal migraine education program for PCPs. METHODS: We conducted a survey to assess primary care physicians' knowledge of migraine. We then held three live educational sessions and developed an email consultation service for PCPs to submit questions they had about migraine. We present both quantitative and qualitative results. RESULTS: Twenty-one PCPs completed the survey. They were generally familiar with the epidemiology of migraine (mean prevalence of reported migraine was 12.6% +/- 10.1), psychiatric comorbidities (mean prevalence of comorbid depression was 24.5% +/- 16.7, mean prevalence of comorbid anxiety was 24.6% +/- 18.3), and evidence-based behavioral treatments. 56% cited cognitive behavioral therapy, 78% cited biofeedback, and 61% cited relaxation therapy as evidence-based treatments. Although most were aware of the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, they did not routinely screen for them (43% did not routinely screen for anxiety, 29% did not routinely screen for depression). PCPs reported frequently referring patients to evidence-based treatments that were not Level A: special diets (60%), acupuncture (50%), physical therapy (30%), and psychoanalysis (20%). Relaxation therapy was a therapy recommended by 40% of PCPs. Only 10% reported referral for cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback. Nineteen percent made little or no use of migraine preventative medications. Seventy-two percent were unaware or barely aware of the American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine. There was variable attendance at the educational sessions (N=22 in the 1st session, 6 in the 2nd session, 15 in the 3rd session). Very few PCPs used the email consultation service (N=4). CONCLUSIONS: Although PCPs are familiar with many aspects of migraine care, there is a need and opportunity for improvement. The three live sessions were poorly attended and the email consultation service was rarely used. We provide an in-depth discussion of specific areas for educational intervention, challenges in developing a migraine education program for PCPs, and areas for future study.",0,0,
57,Model for Collaboration on Quality Improvement Projects: Implementation of a Weight-Based Heparin Dosing Nomogram in an Integrated Healthcare Delivery System,"BACKGROUND: At Aurora Health Care, a Milwaukee-based integrated delivery system, a system-level clinical quality improvement department was established in 1995 to facilitate collaboration on clinical quality improvement (QI) initiatives. THE COLLABORATIVE MODEL: A model was developed to utilize expertise within the system to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, while maintaining acceptance of project interventions at the point of service delivery. It was believed that a single team could design the improvement efforts or guidelines and then work at a more local level with a different group of people to implement the processes. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO THE HEPARIN QI PROJECT: Heparin anticoagulation is considered the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. However, a large gap was found between current anticoagulation practices and published best practice in achieving a key process measure. To reduce the total time to effective anticoagulation, a system-level team created an intervention consisting primarily of a preprinted order form, including weight-based heparin dosing nomogram, and an educational plan for physicians and others. healthcare professionals. Significant improvement was seen at all pilot sites with overall rates of adequate anticoagulation within the first 24 hours improving from 73% to 95%. DISCUSSION: The system was able to standardize care in four of its five main hospitals and provide better patient outcomes in a larger segment of the community, and then replicate the heparin project in four additional sites over a six-month period. This model has been successfully applied to other quality improvement projects.",0,0,
58,modeling tool for policy analysis to support the design of efficient and effective policy responses to complex public health problems.,"Background In the design of public health policy, a broader understanding of disease risk factors throughout the life course and a greater awareness of the social determinants of health have led to the development of more comprehensive intersectoral strategies. to tackle complex problems. . However, comprehensive strategies may not represent the most efficient or effective approach to reducing the burden of disease at the population level. Rather, they can act to allocate finite resources less intensively among a larger number of programs and initiatives, diluting the potential impact of the investment. While analytical tools are available that use research evidence to help identify and prioritize disease risk factors for public health action, they are inadequate to support more targeted and effective policy responses to complex public health problems. Discussion This paper discusses the limitations of analytical tools that are commonly used to support evidence-informed policy decisions for complex problems. It proposes a policy alternative analysis tool that can integrate various sources of evidence and provide a platform for virtual testing of policy alternatives to design solutions that are efficient, effective, and equitable. The case of suicide prevention in Australia is presented to demonstrate the limitations of current tools to adequately inform prevention policy and the usefulness of the new policy analysis tool is discussed. Summary Contrary to popular belief, a systems approach takes a step beyond holistic thinking and seeks to identify where public health action and resources are best directed for optimal impact. It is primarily concerned with what can reasonably be left out of prevention strategies and can be used to explore where disinvestment can occur without negatively affecting the health (or equity) of the population. Simulation modeling used for policy analysis offers the promise of being able to better operationalize research evidence to support decision-making for complex problems, improve public health policy guidance, and offers a foundation for strengthening relationships between policymakers, stakeholders and researchers.",0,0,
59,national cross-sectional study on sociobehavioral factors influencing physicians' decisions to initiate antimicrobial therapy,"PURPOSE: Current efforts to prevent antimicrobial resistance include limiting antimicrobial use, providing education on appropriate use, and developing better point-of-care testing, but what do clinicians really think about rational prescribing and potential interventions? ? We sought to determine what factors might influence a physician's decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy in a patient and their views on measures to promote rational prescribing. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 10,600 physicians from the medical records of all known board-certified physicians in Germany. RESULTS: Among respondents (n = 3,492""; 33%;"" detailed analysis of non-response bias included), 90% indicated that they decide to start antimicrobial therapy in a patient at least once a week, and 66% He informed that he decides it daily. We identify correlates to decide to start antimicrobial therapy in a patient. Predictors were hospital doctor status (odds ratio (OR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.68), male doctor (OR 1.81 (95% CI 1, 42-2.31)), age 50-59 (OR 1.56 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.21)), and practitioners in former East German states (OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.21)) %: 1.15 to 2.21)). Each specialist was significantly less likely to decide to start a course of antimicrobial therapy than were otolaryngologists and urologists. Other predictors agreed to prescribe to be safe (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.03-1.76)), believing that the quality of prescribing practice improves after receiving continuing education from pharmaceutical companies (OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.84)), and experience with failed therapy for resistant pathogens (OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.83-3.19)). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in our sample decide to initiate antimicrobial therapy in a patient and value intervention to support prudent use, eg, continuing education, practice guidelines, and implementation of surveillance measures. Sociobehavioral factors, regional variation, gender, and age deserve further investigation to promote rational antimicrobial prescription and explore related influencing factors.",0,0,
60,new tool to assess the risk of wandering in hospitalized patients,"This article describes the development and implementation of a ambulation detection and intervention program based on the identification of hospitalized patients with cognitive and mobility problems. A wandering screening tool developed by a multidisciplinary team was linked to the appropriate levels of interventions available in the electronic health record. Advanced practice nurses (APNs) confirmed the accuracy of screening and bedside nurse interventions for all patients who tested positive. Of 1,528 patients hospitalized over a 3-week period, 48 (3.1%) tested positive for ambulation. Patients at risk were older (age ≥ 65 years) (66.7%), those admitted to surgical units (41.7%), Caucasian (89.6%), and male (58.3%). Thirteen (27.1%) had dementia and 45 (93.8%) had cognitive problems. Of those patients who tested positive for ambulation, the EPAs coincided with the assessment of the primary care nurses in 79.2% of the cases (38/48) regarding the risk of ambulation and 89.5% (34/38 true positive) for interventions. A two-item wandering screening and intervention tool was feasible for use by bedside nurses. More studies are needed to determine if this tool is effective in preventing wandering.",0,0,
61,"pan-Canadian practice guideline: prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders in adults with cancer","PURPOSE: This study aims to provide recommendations on the optimal strategies and interventions for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of cancer-related sleep disorders (insomnia and sleep syndrome) in adult populations with cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of the published health literature was performed to identify randomized controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and other guidance documents. The Sleep Disorders Expert Panel [composed of nurses, psychologists, primary care physicians, oncologists, sleep physicians, researchers, and guideline methodologists] reviewed, discussed, and approved the final version of the guideline. Healthcare professionals across Canada were asked to provide comments through an external review process. RESULTS: Three clinical practice guidelines and 12 randomized controlled trials were identified as the evidence base. Overall, despite the paucity of evidence, evidence and expert consensus suggest that it is important to screen and screen adult cancer patients for sleep disturbances using standardized screening tools on a routine basis. While prevention of sleep disorders is the desired goal, cognitive behavioral therapies are effective in improving sleep outcomes. As part of the external review with 16 health care providers, 81% indicated that they agreed with the recommendations as written. CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty sleeping is a prevalent problem in cancer populations that needs further recognition by health professionals. Prevention, detection, evaluation and treatment strategies supported by the best available evidence are essential. Recommendations and care route algorithms are offered for practice.",0,0,
62,patient-initiated system for preventive health care.,"Objective To test the efficacy of a patient-initiated touch-sensitive computer system (TSCS) in improving detection rates for breast, cervical, colon and rectal, and oral cavity cancers. Design One-year randomized controlled trial with primary care practice as the unit of analysis. Setting Sixty primary care practices, randomly recruited from 329 non-teaching practices in a southeastern state. Subjects Random sample of the medical records of 50 male and female adult patients before the intervention and 50 adult patients after the intervention in each practice and a random sample of 507 TSCS users. Interventions Touch sensitive computer system and a registered nurse who acted as liaison with the study practices. The TSCS provided patient-specific preventive service recommendations and facilitated workflow to increase completion of these interventions. Main outcome measure Average change, adjusted for health maintenance examination (HME) and TSCS use, in the proportion of eligible patients who underwent screening mammography, clinical breast examination, digital rectal examination, fecal occult blood, flexible sigmoidoscopy, Pap smear, and oral cavity examination. Results We observed a significant increase in the performance of screening mammography (6.6%""; P <= 0.05) and clinical breast examination (6.1%; P <= 0.01) in women of 50 years of age and older, particularly for those who had an HME during the study year. Conclusions Patients who have HME are more likely to be screened for cancer;"" however, a computerized system for preventive services can help improve detection. Among patients who did not have an HME, TSCS users had higher rates of breast cancer detection than nonusers.",0,1,
63,peer review feedback method to promote compliance with preventive care guidelines in an outpatient clinic for residents,"BACKGROUND: Simply distributing clinical practice guidelines to physicians does not change practice behavior. A low-cost peer-review continuous feedback method was used to promote resident physician compliance with nine preventive care guidelines at the Marshall University School of Medicine ambulatory care clinic (Huntington, West Virginia) . METHODS: Preventive care guidelines were distributed and a peer review feedback program was instituted in the resident physician's primary care practice. The frequency of use by the resident doctor of nine preventive care services was evaluated and compared during three periods: preguide (September 1, 1993 to March 1, 1994""; 148 patients), guideline (September 1, 1994 to March 1995; 148 patients) and one year of follow-up (September 1, 1995 to March 1, 1996; 150 patients).Patients in all three periods were similar in age, sex, and risk of influenza and pneumococcal infection. : During the guideline period, resident physicians offered patients four preventive care services: tetanus toxoid immunization, clinical breast exam, Pap smear, and blood occult testing much more frequently than during the preguidance period. All services were offered significantly more often during the one-year follow-up period compared to the pre-guideline period and as often as in the guideline period . CONCLUSION: A low-cost ongoing peer review feedback program significantly and lastingly improves resident physicians' compliance with clinical practice guidelines on preventive care services. However, the effectiveness of the poor review feedback method may not generalize to private practice or other settings. Research should continue on other methods to promote adherence to clinical practice guidelines and to influence the behavior of physicians in general.",0,1,
64,pilot study of an evidence-based interprofessional electronic care planning tool for clients with mental health and addiction problems,"BACKGROUND: The health system must develop effective solutions to the growing challenges it faces regarding people suffering from mental health disorders and addictions. The purpose of this study was to assess the usability and potential impact on outcomes of a knowledge translation system intended to improve evidence-based, client-centered care for hospitalized people with schizophrenia. METHODOLOGY: A pre-posttest design was used. The e-Volution-TREAT system was implemented in two inpatient units at a large mental health center. Thirty-seven nurses, health assistants and doctors participated in two units. Data collection involved questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and observations. Outcome data for thirty-eight consenting clients was collected from the organization's records. RESULTS: Overall, staff participants were very satisfied with the features of the e-Volution-TREAT system. Participants identified barriers to using the system related to work environment, understaffing, equipment issues, discomfort with technology, and a focus on short-term goals rather than long-term ones. There was moderate acceptance of guidelines related to social issues and low acceptance of guidelines related to family support and addictions. There were significant improvements in four client outcomes over time, specifically aggressive behavior, depression, withdrawal, and psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, users were generally satisfied with the e-Volution-TREAT system, although they expressed challenges related to the workload that interfered with the time to use the system. It would be premature to conclude that change in client outcomes was related to the e-Volution-TREAT system without a randomized controlled trial with outcomes compared to a control group. Future research should incorporate strategies to change the context and engage clinicians who are in a position of influence to shape change.",0,1,
65,population-based cross-sectional study of colorectal cancer screening practices of first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the proportions and predictors of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (i) who ever received any CRC testing and (ii) received CRC screening of according to CRC screening guidelines. METHODS: Colorectal cancer patients and their FDRs were recruited through the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry, Victoria, Australia. Seven hundred and seven FDRs completed telephone interviews. Of these, 405 FDRs were considered asymptomatic and suitable for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of FDRs had received any CRC testing. Older first-degree relatives, those with private health insurance, siblings, and FDRs who had ever been asked about a family history of CRC by a physician were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have been tested for CRC. Twenty-five percent of FDRs ""at or slightly above average risk"" adhered to the CRC screening guidelines. For this group, adherence to guideline-recommended screening was significantly more likely for male FDRs and those with a higher level of education. For people at ""moderately increased risk"" and ""potentially high risk,"" 47% and 49%, respectively, adhered to CRC screening guidelines. For this group, guideline-recommended screening was significantly more likely for FDRs who lived in metropolitan areas, had siblings, were married or in a relationship, and were ever asked about a family history of CRC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant level of noncompliance with screening guidelines was evidenced among FDRs. Better CRC detection according to guidelines and effective systematic interventions are needed to increase detection rates among population groups experiencing inequality.

66,primary care nurse-led walking intervention in older adults: PACE (Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Assessment) - elevation cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Brisk walking in older people can increase step count and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) in periods of >/= 10 minutes, as recommended in World Health Organization guidelines. Previous interventions reported increases in step count but no changes in objectively measured MVPA in older people. We evaluated whether a complex intervention performed by primary care nurses increased objectively measured step counts and MVPA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 988 people aged 60 to 75 years, able to walk further and randomly selected from three UK family practices, were invited to participate in a two-arm parallel group randomized trial; random assignment was by household. -ninety-eight people from 250 households were randomized between 2011 and 2012;"" 150 individuals to intervention group, 148 to usual care control group. Intervention participants received four regular care nursing physical activity (PA) consultations for 3 months, incorporating behavior change techniques, pedometer step counting and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, and an individual PA diary and plan.Assessors were not blinded to group status, but statistical analyzes were blinded.The primary outcome was change in mean daily step count assessed by accelerometry between baseline and 3 months, with change at 12 months being a secondary outcome.Other secondary outcomes were change from baseline in time in MVPA weekly in episodes of >/= 10 minutes, accelerometer counts and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months. Reported were adverse events, anthropometric measurements, mood, and pain. Qualitative assessments by intervention participants and practice nurses assessed the acceptability of the intervention. At 3 months, eight participants withdrew or were lost to follow-up, 280 (94%) provided primary outcome data. At 3 months, the changes in both average daily steps and weekly MVPA in sessions of >/= 10 minutes were significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group: at 1037 (95% CI 513 -1560) steps/day and 63 (95% CI 40-87) minutes/week, respectively. At 12 months, the corresponding differences were 609 (95% CI 104-1115) steps/day and 40 (95% CI 17-63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects to steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in the two groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable and enjoyable. CONCLUSIONS: The PACE-Lift trial increased both step count and objectively measured MVPA in episodes of ≥ 10 minutes in people aged 60 to 75 years at 3 and 12 months, with no effect on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first trial in this age group to demonstrate objective increases in MVPA and highlights the value of individualized support incorporating objective assessment of PA in a primary care setting.

67,process to develop a community consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"Large discrepancies remain between pediatricians' practice patterns and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several studies raise additional concerns about access to ADHD treatment for girls, blacks, and poorer people. Barriers can occur at multiple levels, including identification and referral by school personnel, parent help-seeking behavior, medical provider diagnosis, treatment decisions, and acceptance of treatment. Such findings confirm the importance of establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that children of both sexes and all socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic groups receive appropriate assessment and treatment. The AAP ADHD Toolkit publication provides resources to help implement ADHD guidelines in clinical practice. These resources address a number of barriers to office implementation, including unfamiliarity with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, difficulty identifying comorbidities, and inadequate knowledge of effective coding practices. Also crucial to the success of improved processes within clinical practice is community collaboration in care, particularly collaboration with the educational system. Such collaboration addresses other barriers to good care, such as pressures from parents and schools to prescribe stimulants, cultural biases that may prevent schools from screening children for ADHD or may prevent families from seeking medical care, and inconsistencies in recognition and referral between schools in the same system. Collaboration can also create efficiencies in data collection and communications between the doctor and the school, reducing non-face-to-face (and therefore non-reimbursable) elements of care for doctors. This article describes a process used in Guilford County, North Carolina, to develop a consensus among health care providers, educators, and children's advocates regarding the evaluation and treatment of children with symptoms of ADHD. . The result, a community protocol followed by school personnel and community physicians for more than 10 years, ensures communication and collaboration between educators and physicians in the evaluation and treatment of children with ADHD symptoms. This protocol has the potential to increase the efficiency of practice, improve standards of practice for children with ADHD, and improve identification of children in schools. Perhaps most importantly, the community process through which the protocol was developed and implemented has an educational component that increases school personnel's knowledge of ADHD and its treatment, increasing the likelihood that referrals will be appropriate and likelihood that children will benefit from coordination. of interventions between school personnel, physicians, and parents. The protocol reflects a consensus of school personnel and community health care providers regarding the following: (1) ""ideal principles of assessment and management of ADHD""; (2) a common point of entry (a team) into schools for children who need evaluation for inattentiveness and behavior problems, whether the problems are first presented to a medical provider, the behavioral health system, or the school; (3) a protocol followed by the school system , that recognizes the resource limitations of schools but meets the needs of community health care providers for classroom observations, psychoeducational testing, parent-teacher behavior rating scales, and functional assessment; (4) a information packet on each child determined to need a medical evaluation; (5) a contact person or team at each physician's office to receive the information packet e school and direct you to the appropriate physician; (6) an evaluation process that investigates comorbidities and applies appropriate diagnostic criteria; (7) evidence-based interventions; (8) processes for follow-up monitoring of children after the establishment of a treatment plan; (9) roles of core stakeholders (school personnel, physicians, school nurses, and mental health professionals) in the assessment, management, and follow-up of children with attention problems; (10) forms to collect and exchange information at each step; (11) key processes and contacts for the communication flow at each step; and (12) a plan to educate health professionals and schools about the new processes. A replication of the community process, initiated in Forsyth County, North Carolina, in 2001, provides insight into the role of the AAP ADHD Guidelines in facilitating the development of a community consensus protocol. This replication also draws attention to identification and referral barriers at the school level. The following recommendations, drawn from the 2 community processes, describe the role of clinicians in collaborative community care for children with ADHD symptoms. (1) Achieve consensus with the school system regarding the role of school personnel in collecting data for children with learning and behavior problems; components to consider include (a) vision and hearing screenings, (b) school/academic history, (c) classroom observation by a counselor, (d) parent-teacher behavior rating scales ( Vanderbilt, Conner, or Achenbach scales), (e) consideration of speech/language assessment, (f) intelligence screening tests, (g) achievement screening tests, (h) comprehensive intelligence and achievement if discrepancies are apparent on abbreviated tests, and (i) tests of classroom interventions (2) Use pediatric office visits to identify children with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention (history or questionnaire) (3) Refer identified children to the contact person at each child's school, requesting information according to community consensus (4) Designate a contact person to receive school materials it is for practice tic (5) Review school packet and incorporate school data into clinical assessment. (6) Reinforce with parents and the school the need for multimodal intervention, including academic and study strategies for the classroom and home, in-depth psychological testing of children whose discrepancies between cognitive level and performance suggest disabilities learning or language impairments and the need for an individualized education plan (special education), consideration of “other health issues” designation as an alternative route to an individualized education plan or 504 plan (classroom accommodations), behavior modification techniques for specific behavior problems and medication trials, as indicated . (7) Refer the patient to a mental health professional if evaluation suggests coexisting conditions. (8) Use communication forms to share information about medications and diagnoses, recommended interventions, and follow-up plans with the school and family. (9) Receive follow-up reports requested by teachers and parents and make adjustments in therapy as indicated by the child's functioning in specific areas. (10) Maintain communication with the school and parents, especially at times of transition (e.g., beginning and end of the school year, changing schools, times of family stress, times of change in administration, adolescence, and entering college or the workforce).",0,0,
68,multicentre prospective study of a pneumonia practice guideline,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of a length of stay practice guideline on patient outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized intervention trial. SETTING: Six hospitals distributed geographically. PATIENTS: Two hundred and forty-two ""low risk"" patients consecutively hospitalized with pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two patients (63%) completed the post-discharge survey by mail and were included in the analysis. Data were collected prospectively for 85 patients in the initial observation period (B) and 67 patients in the intervention period (I). During I, case managers provided clinicians with information about patient risks based on guideline recommendations. There were no significant changes in guideline compliance (B vs I: 76.5% vs 83.6%"";"" p=0.32) or length of stay (B vs I: 3.5 days [interval 95% confidence interval, 3.2 to 3.8] vs. 3.6 days [95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 4.0]). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant effects of the intervention on patient outcomes, post-discharge care, and patient satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: Patients in this study often had shorter stays than recommended by practice guidelines. This suggests that the external environment may have had a greater effect on physician behavior and length of stay than the practice guideline itself. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of continuous evaluation of medical practices immediately before, during and after the application of the clinical practice guideline.",0,0,
69,protocol for the pharmacological treatment of major depression. A field test of a potential prototype,"BACKGROUND: Much attention is being paid to the development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of mental health disorders. The objective of this study was to test in the field a prototype protocol for the pharmacological treatment of Major Depression. METHOD: The protocol consisted of four six-week treatment phases with critical options in therapy defined by MADRS (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) scores. Observational data collected on the performance of the protocol in terms of relevance, acceptability, ease of use, and efficacy. RESULTS: The efficacy of the protocol was good for those patients who remained within it, with three quarters of them achieving remission. However, more than half of all patients dropped out of care, and adverse events were the most common reason for this. CONCLUSION: The protocol for the treatment of Major Depression was shown to be relevant, easy to use and potentially effective. LIMITATION: Issues of noncompliance by both clinicians and patients posed significant challenges to protocol design. Such difficulties demonstrate the need to field test any proposed design, as preconceived ideas about the performance of a protocol may be misplaced. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The tested protocol represents progress toward the goal of developing optimal strategies for the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents in the treatment of depression.",0,0,
70,qualitative assessment of the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the WHO surgical safety checklist in hospitals in England: lessons from the surgical checklist implementation project,"Objectives: To assess how the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist was implemented in hospitals in England; identify barriers and facilitators to implementation; and extract lessons to implement improvement initiatives in surgery/medical care in general. Background: The WHO checklist has been linked to better surgical outcomes and teamwork, but we know little about the factors that affect its successful adoption. Methods: A longitudinal study of interviews with operating theater staff in a representative sample of 10 hospitals in England was conducted between March 2010 and March 2011. Interviews were audio recorded by telephone. Interviewees were asked about their experience of how the checklist was introduced and the factors that hindered or helped this process. The transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. Results: A total of 119 interviews were completed. Checklist implementation varied widely between and within hospitals, from pre-planned/staged approaches to the checklist simply 'showing up' in operating rooms, or staff felt it had been imposed. Most of the barriers to implementation were specific to the checklist itself (for example, perceived design issues), but also included problematic integration into pre-existing processes. The most common barrier was resistance from experienced clinicians. Facilitators revealed some positive steps that can be taken to prevent/address these barriers, for example modifying the checklist, providing education/training, feeding back local data, fostering strong leadership (particularly at the support level), and instilling accountability. Conclusions: We identified common themes that helped or hindered the introduction of the WHO checklist in England and translated these into recommendations to guide the implementation of improvement initiatives in surgery and wider healthcare systems.",0,1,
71,qualitative study to understand the inconsistent use of imaging guidelines to stage incident prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Approximately half of veterans with low-risk prostate cancer receive images that are inconsistent with guidelines. Our aim was to identify and describe (1) clinicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the use of imaging to stage prostate cancer, (2) patient attitudes and behaviors related to the use of imaging, and (3) compare responses at three VA Medical Centers (VAMC). METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to explore patient and provider knowledge and behaviors regarding the use of images. We conducted 39 semi-structured interviews in total, including 22 interviews with newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 17 interviews with physicians caring for them, between September 2014 and July 2015 at three VAMCs representing a spectrum of inadequate imaging indices. After identifying the core theoretical concepts, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was selected to explore the links between the themes within the dataset and the existing domains within the framework. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded and analyzed using Nvivo software. RESULTS: Patient interview topics were classified into four TDF domains. Patients reported little interest in staging compared to disease management (goals), and many could not remember if they had images (knowledge). Patients tended to trust their doctor to make decisions about appropriate tests (beliefs about abilities). Some patients expressed minor concern about radiation exposure, but anxiety about cancer outcomes outweighed these fears (excitement). Physician interview topics were categorized into five TDF domains. Most clinicians reported knowing and trusting imaging guidelines (knowledge), although some are likely to follow their own intuition, either due to clinical suspicion or years of experience (beliefs about capabilities). In addition, physicians reported that medicolegal concerns, fear of missing associated diagnoses (beliefs about consequences), the influence of colleagues who frequently take images (social influences), and the facility where they practice influence rates of images (environmental context). CONCLUSIONS: Interviews with patients and physicians suggest that physicians are the primary (and in some cases the only) decision makers regarding imaging staging for prostate cancer. This finding suggests that a physician-led intervention may be the most effective strategy for improving guideline-consistent imaging of prostate cancer.",0,0,
72,quality improvement intervention to address provider behavior related to utilization of the CA-MRSA guidelines,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a provider-focused quality improvement educational intervention on appropriate prescribing for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. BACKGROUND: Patient, provider, and health system factors contribute to the appropriate prescription of antibiotics. Achieving an adequate prescription is essential to reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance. Knowledge of appropriate prescribing for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is the first step in shifting prescriber behavior toward evidence-based recommendations. DESIGN: Quality Improvement Project. METHOD: Following a review of best practice guidelines and application of the Stetler Research Utilization model, a brief educational intervention was delivered using PowerPoint speech. Elements of the educational intervention included indications for screening, focusing particularly on the role of watch and wait after culture for simple abscesses. The intervention was delivered in a for-profit, nonacademic urgent care setting and assessed the knowledge and practice of prescribing providers. RESULTS: Of the 48 medical providers, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, 18 (37.5%) participated"";"" 12 of the 18 (67%) participants showed an increase in knowledge. Forty-three percent of prescriber charts demonstrated improved practice through use of the guidelines. Of 18 prescribers, 44% submitted a total of 21 abscess cultures. There was no difference in practice behaviors between the professional groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in knowledge scores, this improvement in knowledge did not translate into a dramatic change in practice, although trends in a positive direction were observed. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This quality improvement project highlights the complexity of changing prescriber behavior and the need for ongoing interventions.",0,0,
73,Quantitative Method for Assessing Prescription Patterns Using Electronic Health Records,"BACKGROUND: Most quality indicators available for hospitals are represented by simple ratios or proportions and are limited to specific events. A generalized method that can be applied to various clinical events has not been developed. The aim of this study was to develop a simple method to assess physicians' prescribing patterns for various events and their level of knowledge of clinical practice guidelines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a quantitative method called Prescribing Pattern Around Clinical Event (PACE), which is applicable to electronic health records (EHRs). Three discrete prescribing patterns (intervention, maintenance, and discontinuation) were determined from the prescription change index (PCI), which was calculated as the increase or decrease in the prescription rate following a clinical event. Hyperkalaemia and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) were used as example cases. We calculated the PCIs of 10 drugs related to hyperkalemia, classified them into prescribing patterns, and then compared the resulting prescribing patterns with known standards for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Physicians' knowledge of hyperkalaemia was estimated using a questionnaire and compared with the prescription pattern. Prescriptions for CDAD were also determined and compared with clinical knowledge. Clinical data from 1698, 348 and 1288 patients were collected from EHR data. Physicians' prescribing behaviors for hyperkalaemia and CDAD were consistent with standard knowledge. Prescribing patterns correlated well with individual physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia (kappa = 0.714). Prescribing behaviors according to event severity or clinical condition were plotted as a simple summary graph. CONCLUSION: The algorithm successfully evaluated prescription patterns from the EHR data. Prescribing patterns correlated well with physician knowledge. We hope that this algorithm will allow the quantification of prescribers' adherence to clinical guidelines and be used to facilitate better prescribing practices.",0,0,
74,"randomized clinical trial of a personalized lifestyle intervention for obese, sedentary and primary care patients","PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to test a personalized lifestyle intervention to help obese primary care patients achieve weight loss and increase physical activity. METHODS: We conducted a 24-month randomized clinical trial in Rhode Island. Primary care physicians identified obese, sedentary patients motivated to lose weight and increase their moderate to vigorous physical activity. These patients were randomized to 1 of 2 experimental groups: enhanced intervention (EI) or standard intervention (SI). Both groups received 3 face-to-face weight loss meetings. The enhanced intervention group also received counseling telephone calls, personalized print materials, and DVDs focused on diet and physical activity. Active intervention occurred at year 1 with a gradual maintenance phase at year 2. RESULTS: 211 obese and sedentary patients were recruited from 24 primary care practices. The participants were 79% women and 16% minorities. They had a mean age of 48.6 years, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 37.8 kg/m(2) and 21.2 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Significantly more EI participants lost 5% of their initial weight than SI participants (per visit group, P < .001). The difference was significant during active treatment at 6 months (37.2% IS vs. 12.9% SI) and at 12 months (47.8% vs. 11.6%), but ceased to be significant during maintenance phase at 18 months (31.4% vs. 26.7%). or 24 months (33.3% vs 24.6%). The IS group reported significantly more minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity over time than the SI group (per visit group, P = 0.04). The differences in minutes per week at 6 months was 95.7 for the IS group vs. 68.3 minutes for the SI group”; at 12 months it was 126.1 vs 73.7”; at 18 months 103.7 vs 63.7 and at 24 months 101.3 vs 75.4. Similar trends were found for absolute weight loss and the percentage meeting national physical activity guidelines. CONCLUSION: A home-based personalized lifestyle intervention in obese and sedentary primary care patients was effective in promoting weight loss and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with effects peaking at 12 months but decrease at 24 months.",0,0,
75,randomized controlled trial of a drug use review intervention for sedative-hypnotic medications,"OBJECTIVES: Both the public and private sectors use medication use review to influence patients' prescribing behavior and medication use. Previous interventions mailed to prescribers have had mixed results. The objective was to assess the effect of a single mailed intervention on subsequent use of sedative-hypnotic medication. METHODS: An experimental design was used. The intervention contained guidelines for the use of sedative-hypnotics, a prescriber profile detailing the prescription of sedative-hypnotics, and a patient profile. Pooling of patients and their shared prescribers was done to avoid contamination bias and statistical problems associated with lack of independence of observations. Subjects were 189 Washington State Medicaid recipients who had received at least one tablet per day of a sedative-hypnotic medication for 1 year and their prescribing physicians or (when physician information was missing) dispensing pharmacy. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the use of targeted sedative-hypnotic medications was measured in the intervention group (-27.6%) versus the control group (-8.5%). In the intervention group, 9.4% of patients started a new prescription for a benzodiazepine not covered in the drug use review, whereas no control patients had a new use of a benzodiazepine not covered. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention achieved a statistically significant decrease in targeted drug use, and the amount of reduction is likely to have decreased the risk of fractures associated with benzodiazepine use. This study adds to recent evidence that mail-order medication use review interventions can have a desirable impact on patients' medication use.",0,0,
76,randomized controlled trial of an extensive lifestyle management intervention (ELMI) after cardiac rehabilitation: study design and baseline data,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) represent comprehensive interventions that are generally limited to four months. After completing CRP, it appears that risk factors and lifestyle behaviors may deteriorate. The Extensive Lifestyle Management Intervention (ELMI) Post Cardiac Rehabilitation trial will investigate the benefits of a randomized intervention to prevent these adverse changes. METHODS: Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) were randomized following standard CRP to ELMI or usual care. The ELMI program is a case management intervention aimed at individualizing risk factor and lifestyle management based on current treatment guidelines. The program consists of cardiac rehabilitation sessions, telephone follow-up, and risk factor and lifestyle counseling sessions. Health professionals work with participants through behavioral counseling and communications with participants' family physicians. Usual care participants return to the care of their family physicians and come to the study clinic only for an annual outcome evaluation. The primary outcome is the change in the global risk of ischemic heart disease after four years. Secondary outcomes include composite cardiovascular events, health care utilization, lifestyle adherence, quality of life, and risk factors. RESULTS: Over 28 months, 302 men and women were randomized. This represented 29% of the total population examined. The average age of study participants is 64 years, 18% are women, 53% have had a prior myocardial infarction, 73% have undergone prior revascularization, and 20% have diabetes mellitus. Ischemic heart disease risk factors for the entire cohort improved significantly after subjects had undergone previous CPAs. Baseline risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, and medications were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study population is representative of patients who complete a standard PCR. The results of the ELMI trial will provide valuable information for future CRP design.",0,0,
77,randomized controlled trial of IVR-based brief alcohol intervention to promote patient-provider communication in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Brief interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care settings are effective but underused. Efforts to improve brief intervention rates through provider education and redesign of office systems have had limited impact. Our novel brief intervention uses interactive voice response (IVR) to provide information and advice directly to unhealthy drinkers prior to a doctor's office visit, with the goal of stimulating office dialogue about alcohol use and decreasing alcohol consumption. unhealthy consumption. This automated approach is potentially scalable for wide application. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the effect of a pre-visit IVR-delivered brief alcohol intervention (IVR-BI) on patient-provider conversations about alcohol during the visit. DESIGN: This was a parallel group randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms: 1) IVR-BI or 2) usual care (no IVR-BI). PARTICIPANTS: In total, 1567 patients were recruited from eight internal medicine and family medicine clinics affiliated with university medical centers. INTERVENTIONS: IVR-BI is a brief alcohol intervention provided by automated telephone. It has four components, based on the intervention steps outlined in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines for clinicians: 1) ask about alcohol use, 2) assess for alcohol use disorders, 3) counsel the patient reduce or stop drinking, and 4) follow-up at subsequent visits. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes were patient-reported: provider-patient discussion about alcohol during visit""; patient initiation of discussion;"" and the provider's recommendation regarding the patient's alcohol consumption. KEY FINDINGS: Patients randomized to BI-IVR were more likely to have reported discussing alcohol with their provider (52% vs. 44%, p = 0.003) and mentioned the topic themselves (20% vs. 12% , p < 0.001), and receiving a recommendation (20% vs. 14%, p < 0.001). Other predictors of outcome included baseline consumption, education, age, and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Providing brief automated interventions to patients prior to a primary care visit promotes discussion of unhealthy alcohol use and increases specific professional advice on changing drinking behavior.",0,0,
78,randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma distance learning program for pediatricians,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the provider acceptability of a distance learning program for pediatric asthma and to test its effects on clinicians' knowledge, attitudes, and treatment practices. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Louisville and surrounding central Kentucky. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four pediatricians in clinical practice. Interventions. A distance learning program for pediatric asthma consisting of CD-ROM or Web-based multimedia learning modules and two teleconference calls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Student satisfaction and change in physician's asthma management knowledge, attitudes, and behavior at 1 to 4 months (short-term) and 6 to 8 months (long-term). RESULTS: Pediatricians had graduated from medical school a mean of 11.6 years before baseline (SD +/-8.9)"";"" 56% were women. For all student satisfaction items, the average score was 4.0 or higher on a 5-point scale, indicating a favorable response from the participants. Participants in the education group reported greater familiarity with the asthma guideline for prescribing daily inhaled corticosteroids compared with control physicians (p = 0.03) at short-term follow-up. Participants also expressed greater confidence in selecting a medication for patients requiring a low-dose inhaled steroid (p = 0.03). However, these differences were not seen at long-term follow-up. Compared to the control group, there was no significant increase in the proportion of patients receiving inhaled steroids for persistent asthma at short-term or long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians using an asthma distance learning program expressed a high degree of student satisfaction. The program was associated with a temporary increase in familiarity and confidence in implementing the components of the asthma guidelines.",0,0,
79,randomized controlled trial to improve lymph node assessment in stage II colon cancer,"HYPOTHESIS: Physicians appear to learn best from their peers, but the impact of opinion leaders on physician behavior is unclear. Because colon cancer staging has been identified as suboptimal in Ontario, Canada, we sought to assess the influence of local colon cancer experts and opinion leaders in optimizing colon cancer lymph node evaluation. colon. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A cluster-randomized trial including all hospitals in Ontario that identified a local opinion leader with intervention between January 5 and June 17, 2004. INTERVENTION: All 42 centers received a standardized conference on colon cancer lymph node evaluation from colon cancer expert opinion leader. The 21 intervention hospitals also received academic details from a local opinion leader by the expert opinion leader and a toolkit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean number of lymph nodes assessed in patients with stage II colon cancer and the proportion of cases staged with a minimum of 12 lymph nodes before and after a standardized conference were evaluated. RESULTS: Patient demographics and tumor factors were similar in both groups before and after the standardized conference. Lymph node assessment was significantly improved after standardized conference at intervention and control sites (P < 0.001). No additional benefit was shown from the provision of academic tools and details in the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of information in person by an expert opinion leader in colon cancer can stimulate performance regarding the evaluation of lymph nodes for colon cancer. Academic details from a local opinion leader did not further improve the lymph node assessment.",0,0,
80,randomized outpatient trial of a decision support information technology tool.,"Background Decision support information technology is often adopted to improve clinical decision making, but is rarely rigorously evaluated. Congress mandated the evaluation of Problem-Knowledge Couplers (PKC Corp, Burlington, Vt), a proposed decision-support tool for the Department of Defense's new health information network. Methods This was a patient-level randomized trial conducted in 2 military practices. A total of 936 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 966 to usual care. The couplers were applied prior to routine outpatient clinic visits. The primary outcome was quality of care, which was assessed based on the total percentage of any of the 24 health care quality process measures (opportunities to provide evidence-based care) that were met. Secondary outcomes included medical resources consumed within 60 days of enrollment and patient and provider satisfaction. Results There were 4,639 medical care opportunities (2,374 in the Coupler group and 2,265 in the usual care group), with no difference in the proportion of opportunities fulfilled (33.9% vs. 30.7%"";"" P = 0.12 ). Although there was a modest improvement in performance on screening/prevention measures, this was offset by poorer performance on some acute care measures. Coupled patients used more laboratory and pharmacy resources than usual care patients (mean log difference, $71). No difference in patient satisfaction was seen between groups, and provider satisfaction was mixed. Conclusion This study does not provide strong evidence to support the usefulness of this decision support tool, but it does demonstrate the value of a rigorous evaluation of decision support information technology.",0,1,
81,"randomized trial of ""corollary orders"" to avoid errors of omission.","Objective: Errors of omission are a common cause of system failure. Doctors often do not order the tests or treatments needed to monitor/improve the effects of other tests or treatments. The authors hypothesized that automated guideline-based reminders for physicians, provided as they wrote orders, might reduce these omissions. Design: The study was conducted in the general medicine hospitalization ward of a public university hospital. Faculty and interns at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who used computer workstations to type orders, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. As the intervening physicians wrote orders for 1 of 87 selected tests or treatments, the computer suggested the corollary orders needed to detect or ameliorate adverse reactions to the triggering orders. Physicians could accept or reject these suggestions. Results: During the 6-month trial, corollary order reminders were presented to 48 intervention physicians and withheld from 41 control physicians. Intervention physicians ordered the suggested corollary orders in 46.3% of cases when reminded, compared with 21.9% compliance by control physicians (p < 0.0001). Physicians were discriminating in their acceptance of suggested orders, readily accepting some and rejecting others. There were a third fewer pharmacist-initiated interventions with physicians in the intervention than in the control groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that physician workstations, linked to a comprehensive electronic medical record, can be an effective means of reducing errors or omissions and improving adherence to practice guidelines.",1,1,
82,randomized trial of a computer-based intervention to reduce the use of redundant laboratory tests.,"PURPOSE: To determine the impact of giving clinicians computerized reminders about seemingly redundant clinical laboratory tests. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial that included all patients hospitalized in a large university hospital over a 15-week period. The intervention consisted of computerized reminders at the time a test that appeared to be redundant was ordered. The main outcome measures were the proportions of clinical laboratory orders that were canceled and the proportion of tests that were actually performed. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 939 apparently redundant laboratory tests among the 77,609 study tests that were ordered between the intervention (n = 5,700 patients) and control (n = 5,886 patients) groups. In the intervention group, 69% (300 of 437) of tests were canceled in response to reminders. Of 137 overrides, 41% appeared to be justified based on chart review. In the control group, 51% of the ordered redundant tests were performed, whereas in the intervention group only 27% of the ordered redundant tests were performed (P < 0.001). However, the estimated annual savings in lab fees was only $35,000. This occurred because only 44% of the redundant tests performed had computer commands, because only half of the computer commands were checked for redundancy, and because nearly one-third of the reminders were overridden. CONCLUSIONS: Reminders about apparently redundant lab test orders were effective when delivered. However, the overall effect was limited because many tests were performed without corresponding computer commands and many commands were not checked for redundancy.",1,1,
83,randomized trial of computerized reminders and audit and feedback to improve HIV screening in a primary care setting.,"Despite recommendations for voluntary HIV testing, few medical centers have implemented screening programs. The objective of the study was to determine whether a computer-based reminder and feedback intervention would increase HIV screening in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. The study design was a randomized controlled trial at five primary care clinics in the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. All primary care providers were eligible to participate in the study. The study intervention consisted of computer-based reminders to assess HIV risk behaviors or offer HIV testing""; feedback was provided on adherence to the reminders. The main outcome measure was the difference in HIV testing rates. HIV between intervention and control providers Control group providers assessed 1.0% (n = 67) and 1.4% (n = 106) of patients in the preintervention and intervention period , respectively;"" intervention providers evaluated 1.8% (n=98) and 1.9% (n=114), respectively (P=0.75). In our random sample of 753 unscreened patients, 204 (27%) had documented risk behaviors. Providers were more likely to adhere to reminders to take the test than reminders to take the risk assessment (11% versus 5%, P < 0.01). Sixty-one percent of providers felt that a lack of time prevented risk assessment. In conclusion, in primary care consultations in our setting, HIV detection rates were low. Providers were unaware of the high rates of risk behaviors in their patient population and perceived significant barriers to testing. Low-intensity clinical reminders and feedback did not increase detection rates.",0,1,
84,randomized trial of computerized reminders for blood pressure screening in primary care.,"In a randomized controlled trial (N = 8298), the authors compared three ways of encouraging patients in a large family practice to have their blood pressure checked. Working from computerized medical records at a family medicine teaching center, the study included patients aged 18 and older who had not had their blood pressure measured in the previous year. In a normal-care control group, 21.1% of those due for a blood pressure reading got one during the trial year. In one intervention group, a computer-generated message reminded the doctor to check the blood pressure of patients visiting the center for an appointment; 30.7% of the patients assigned to this group were controlled. In the second group, the nurse contacted patients by phone and encouraged 24.1% of those due for a checkup to get one. Sending a letter to patients in the third group yielded a 35.7% compliance rate. Considering the costs of the three interventions, the medical reminder was the most expensive. cash, followed by the letter reminder. Although statistically significant, the impact of reminders was modest. A better approach might involve a combination of routine reminders to the doctor, followed by letters to noncompliant patients.",0,1,
85,randomized trial of electronic clinical reminders to improve the quality of care for diabetes and coronary artery disease.,"Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of a patient-specific, integrated electronic clinical reminder system on diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) care and to assess clinicians' attitudes toward this system. reminder. Design: We enrolled 194 primary care physicians caring for 4,549 patients with diabetes and 2,199 patients with CAD at 20 outpatient clinics. Clinics were randomized so that physicians received evidence-based electronic reminders within their patients' electronic medical record or usual care. There were five reminders for diabetes care and four reminders for DKA care. Measurements: The primary outcome was receiving recommended care for diabetes and CAD. We created a summary outcome to assess the odds of increased adherence to general diabetes care (based on five measures) and general CAD care (based on four measures). We surveyed physicians to assess attitudes toward the reminder system. Results: Adherence rates at baseline for all quality measures were low. Although electronic reminders increased the odds of recommended diabetes care (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.67) and DKA (OR 1.25, CI 95% 1.01–1.55), the impact of individual reminders was variable. A total of three of nine reminders effectively increased rates of recommended care for diabetes or CAD. The majority of physicians (76%) thought reminders improved quality of care. Conclusion: An integrated electronic reminder system resulted in variable improvement in diabetes and DKA care. These improvements were often limited and quality gaps persist.",1,1,
86,randomized trial of the efficacy of on-demand versus computer-activated medication decision support in primary care.,"Objectives: Prescription alerts generated by computerized drug decision support (CDDS) can prevent drug-related morbidity. However, the vast majority of alerts are ignored due to clinical irrelevance. The ability to customize commercial alert systems should improve physician acceptance, as the physician can select the circumstances and types of drug alerts that are displayed. We tested the effectiveness of two approaches to personalizing medication alerts to reduce the prevalence of prescribing problems: physician-initiated decision support versus computer-driven decision support. Physicians in each study condition were able to preset levels that triggered alerts. Design: This was a cluster trial with 28 primary care physicians randomized to automated or on-demand CDDS in the MOXXI medication management system for 3,449 of their patients seen over the next 6 months. Measurements: The CDDS generated alerts for prescription problems that could be customized by level of severity. Prescribing problems included dosage errors, drug-drug interactions, age, allergy, and illness. Physicians randomly assigned to the on-demand option turned on medication review when they deemed it clinically relevant, while physicians randomized to computer-enabled decision support viewed all e-prescription alerts according to the level of severity they received. selected for prevalent problems and incidents. Administrative claims and MOXXI data were used to measure the difference in the prevalence of prescribing problems at the end of follow-up. Results: During follow-up, 50% of clinicians receiving computer-triggered alerts changed alert threshold (n = 7), and 21% of clinicians in the alert-on-demand group changed alert level (n = 7). = 3) . In the on-demand group, 4,445 prescription problems were identified, 41 (0.9%) were treated for review of requested medications and in 31 problems (75.6%) the prescription was reviewed. By comparison, 668 (10.3%) of the 6,505 prescription problems in the computer-triggered group were observed, and 81 (12.1%) were reviewed. Most alerts were ignored because the benefit was judged to outweigh the risk, the interaction was known, or the interaction was judged not to be clinically important (computer triggered: 75.8% of 585 alerts ignored; on request: 90% of 10 alerts ignored alerts). At the end of follow-up, there was a significant reduction in therapeutic duplication problems in the computer-activated group (odds ratio 0.55, p = 0.02), but there was no difference in the overall prevalence of prescription problems. Conclusion: Computer customization Triggered alert systems are more helpful in detecting and resolving prescribing problems than on-demand review, but neither approach was effective in reducing prescribing problems. New strategies are needed to maximize the use of drug decision support systems to reduce drug-related morbidity.",1,1,

88,real-world staggered-cluster randomized trial of practice facilitation to improve cardiovascular care,"BACKGROUND: Practice facilitation has been associated with significant improvements in disease prevention and quality of patient care. Using practice facilitation, the Improving the Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project aimed to improve evidence-based cardiovascular care delivery in primary care practices in a large health region. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of IDOCC on adherence to care processes. METHODS: A pragmatic stepped wedge-cluster randomized trial recruiting primary care providers in practices located in eastern Ontario, Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00574808). Participants were randomly assigned by region to one of three steps. Practice facilitators were intended to visit practices every 3-4 (year 1-intensive) or 6-12 weeks (year 2-sustainability) to support practice behavior changes. The primary outcome was mean adherence to evidence-based care indicators measured at the patient level. Adherence was assessed by chart review of a randomly selected cohort of 66 patients per practice in each year prior to intervention, as well as at year 1 and year 2 post-intervention. RESULTS: 84 practices (182 physicians) participated. On average, facilitators had 6.6 (min: 2, max: 11) face-to-face practice visits in year 1 and 2.5 (min: 0, max: 10) visits in year 2. We collected data of files of 5292 patients. After adjustment for patient and provider characteristics, there was an absolute decrease of 1.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.9 to -0.9%) and 4.2% ( 95% CI: -5.7 to -2.6%) in baseline mean adherence to intensive and sustainability years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: IDOCC did not improve adherence to best practice guidelines. Our results showed a small statistically significant decrease in mean adherence of questionable clinical significance. Possible reasons for this result include implementation challenges, conflicting priorities in practices, a broad focus on multiple indicators of chronic disease, and the use of an overall adherence index. These results contrast with previously reported facilitation trial findings and highlight the complexities and challenges of translating research findings into clinical practice.

89,research agenda for high-value palliative care,"Palliative care has gone from being misunderstood and viewed with caution by many physicians to being among the most sought after services by health care systems across the country. This is the greatest possible testimony to the potential value of the field. However, with demand rapidly outstripping supply for palliative care specialists (1), the field's ability to deliver high-value care sustainably is paradoxically threatened by its own success. We propose a research agenda organized around 5 key questions about the optimal organization and allocation of limited resources in specialized palliative care to bridge the gap between workforce and patient need. The table provides important considerations and proposed approaches to address each research challenge. Amid a growing body of evidence about the potential value of specialized palliative care (2), we posit that answering these questions is essential to maximizing value and informing much-needed policies to support such care (3).",0,0,

91,A review of family intervention guidelines for acquired brain injury in pediatrics,"Pediatric Acquired Brain Injury (BI) not only affects the child with the injury, but also has a major impact on their family. Studies suggest that there are higher rates of psychological distress among caregivers and siblings after a child in the family has had an IB. In addition, family functioning after BI affects the child's recovery. In the literature review, we identified seven theoretical clinical guidelines for working with families of children and adolescents with BI. These clinical guidelines are as follows: (1) select developmentally appropriate interventions, (2) match the intervention to the family, (3) provide advocacy, (4) provide injury education, (5) focus on family realignment , (6) appropriately adjust the child's environment, and (7) provide skills training to the family and child. Existing research on family interventions for BI is reviewed in the context of these theoretical guidelines, and then the empirical support for each guideline is assessed using specific criteria for empirically supported treatments. Unfortunately, very few randomized controlled studies exist and continued research is needed to classify all clinical regimens as 'effective'. Additionally, ongoing research will help inform professionals of specific approaches to use when working with a family of a child with BI. Currently, clinicians and researchers can draw on existing clinical guidelines to help address the many barriers to implementation and study of family interventions for pediatric BI.",0,0,
92,review of quantitative studies on adherence to clinical practice guidelines in mental health,"Mental health clinical practice guidelines have proliferated, but there is little evidence on the degree to which they are actually implemented in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to locate and review all peer-reviewed reports published up to the year 2000 that provide quantitative information on adherence rates to specific mental health guidelines. A literature search returned 41 relevant studies. These studies were of three types: 26 were cross-sectional investigations conducted after guideline publication, six were conducted before and after guideline publication without any specific intervention (pre/post), and nine involved a controlled trial of an intervention. specific. Only 37% were carried out in the mental health specialty sector. Adequate adherence was found in 27% of cross-sectional and pre/post studies, but in 67% of controlled trials. Successful interventions tended to be complex, involving system redesign or additional resources. Only six of 13 investigations (46%) that also measured patient outcome found that better outcome was associated with greater adherence to guidelines. Several studies showed that after cessation of interventions, adherence rates returned to pre-intervention levels. Thus, the evidence indicates that guideline adherence is not high without a specific intervention, but that certain interventions (typically multifaceted and resource-intensive) improve adherence. However, the public health challenge is to design and implement interventions that are sustainable in general clinical practice.",0,0,
93,review of the evidence for suboptimal compliance of healthcare professionals with standard/universal precautions for infection control.,"OBJECTIVES: The review examines from international research: the extent to which professionals comply with infection control precautions; relevant issues that are considered influential on compliance; what strategies have been evaluated to instigate positive behavior change among practitioners and the effect of these interventions. BACKGROUND: Internationally, standard/universal precautions (UP) are considered essential in infection prevention and control, and effective in protecting clinicians and patients. However, adherence has been problematic and the practice of standard/UP precautions is globally suboptimal. METHODS: Literature review where relevant evidence was identified using various electronic databases, from 1994 to 2006, with the number of key terms used. The data was extracted using key headings, which facilitated analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were evaluated. Twenty-four related to the measurement of physician compliance and 13 studies that evaluated the t The effect of a research intervention on compliance. In addition, other studies that examined specific reasons for suboptimal compliance or discussed infection control precautions in general were included. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with infection control precautions is internationally suboptimal. Evidence confirms that adherence to specific aspects of the standards/UP varies, and practitioners are selective in applying recommended practice. Compliance improves after a structured intervention; however, the research does not indicate how long the intervention affects physician compliance, or whether compliance returns to the norm after a period of time. Various reasons for noncompliance are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested. Relevance for clinical practice.

94,review of the literature on remote monitoring technology in incentive-based interventions for health-related behavior change.,"The use of technology (eg, the Internet, cell phones) to enable remote implementation of incentive interventions for health-related behavior change is growing. To our knowledge, a systematic review of this literature has not yet been reported. This report provides a systematic review of controlled studies in which technology was used to remotely implement financial incentive interventions targeting substance use and other health behaviors published between 2004 and 2015. For inclusion in the review, studies had to use the technology to remotely achieve 1 of the following 2 goals, alone or in combination: (a) monitor the target behavior, or (b) offer incentives to achieve the target goal. Studies also had to examine financial incentives (eg, cash, vouchers) for health-related behavior change, be published in peer-reviewed journals, and include a research design that would allow the efficacy of the intervention to be assessed. incentives in relation to another condition (eg, non-contingent incentives, usual treatment).

METHODS: Inappropriate laboratory use in a cross-sectional survey was reviewed through retrospective analysis of 384 medical records at a tertiary care center. To pave the way for future interventions, evidence of overuse was classified into two categories, inappropriate and inefficient, and then analyzed. Frequency analysis was used to analyze patient age, gender, hospital wards, length of stay, and diagnosis, as well as inappropriate testing and inefficient testing. RESULTS: A total of 143 (1.50%) of the tests were inefficient and were ordered by laboratory errors such as hemolysis, inefficient sampling or absurd results. 2,522 (26.40%) of the tests were inappropriate and stemmed from noncompliance with medical/clinical suitability criteria. CONCLUSION: Although inappropriate test requesting was more frequent than inefficient testing, the initial improvement strategy should focus on physicians' test requesting behavior by conducting appropriate teaching strategies, continuous auditing and educational feedback, implementing health information technology tools and using laboratory practice guidelines (LPG). ) and testing algorithms. It is recommended to carry out a cycle of continuous improvement of the quality of laboratory services and the training of personnel involved in taking blood samples for inefficient tests.",0,0,
96,simple intervention to improve hospital prescription of antibiotics,"OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in prescribing behavior after distribution of antibiotic guidelines printed on a 9 x 6 cm laminated card suitable for clipping to a hospital badge. INTERVENTION: Guidelines for the proper prescription of antibiotics for 20 common and important pediatric infections were printed on a 9 x 6 cm laminated card suitable for affixing to a hospital name tag and distributed to all medical staff. DESIGN: We collected medical record data for three marker conditions (tonsillitis, pneumonia, and orbital/periorbital cellulitis) in patient samples from the six-month periods on either side of the month in which the cards were distributed. The prescribers were unaware of the study and the researchers analyzed the prescriptions without knowing the period in which they were written. The prescriptions were classified according to the appropriate choice of antibiotic and the appropriate dose. Data on the costs of antibiotics were also collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of cases in which the choice of antibiotic was appropriate; proportion of cases in which the dose of the antibiotic was adequate; Annualized costs of third-generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: For tonsillitis there was little change in prescribing practice after the cards were introduced. For pneumonia, appropriate choice cases increased from 77% to 92% (P = 0.028) and appropriate dose cases increased from 48% to 81% (P = 0.001). For orbital/periorbital cellulitis, cases with the appropriate choice increased from 19% to 78% (P < 0.001), and cases with the appropriate dose increased from 30% to 51% (P = 0.11). Annualized costs for third-generation cephalosporins were $193,245 pre-cards and $89,814 post cards. CONCLUSION: The cards appeared to have a beneficial effect on prescription practice for all three marker conditions. This simple intervention is likely to be cost-effective and helpful in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.",0,1,

Previous findings have suggested that asthma management, particularly in primary care, remains suboptimal and recent government initiatives have been implemented to improve asthma management and encourage the use of written asthma action plans (WAAPs) in practice. general. Our aim was to assess the self-reported attitudes, confidence and practices of managing pediatric asthma in a convenience sample of Australian general practitioners (GPs). An initial questionnaire was administered to GPs as part of a randomized controlled trial. General practitioners (GPs) were recruited from two areas in the Sydney, NSW metropolitan area between 2006 and 2008. Invitations were sent to approximately 1200 potentially eligible GPs. Of 150 (12.5%) physicians who enrolled, 122 (10.2%) completed the referral questionnaire. Although 89% were aware of the Australian National Asthma Guidelines, less than 40% were familiar with the guideline recommendations. While 85.2% had positive attitudes toward WAAPs, only 45.1% reported providing them frequently. For children with frequent symptoms, 90% agreed that they should prescribe inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) every day, and 83% reported that they currently prescribe ICS to such patients. These findings indicate gaps between the attitudes and behaviors of GPs and highlight opportunities for interventions to improve pediatric asthma management.",0,0,
99,statewide controlled trial intervention to reduce the use of unproven or ineffective breast cancer care,"BACKGROUND: Challenged by public opinion, peers, and the Congressional Budget Office, specialty medical societies have begun developing ""Top Five"" lists of costly procedures that do not provide significant benefit to at least some categories of patients for which they are commonly requested. However, the extent to which these lists have influenced the behavior of physicians or patients is unknown. METHODS: We partnered with a state health systems consortium to examine the effectiveness of two interventions: (i) ""basic"" public reporting and (ii) an ""enhanced"" intervention, augmenting public reporting with a smartphone-based application that provides providers with just-in-time information, decision-making tools, and personalized patient education materials to support reductions in the use of eight breast cancer interventions targeted by Choosing Wisely(R) or guidelines of the oncology society. Our objectives are: (1) to examine whether basic public information reduces the use of targeted breast cancer practices among a contemporary cohort of incident breast cancer patients in the intervention state relative to usual care in the intervention states. comparison""; (2) examine the effectiveness of the enhanced intervention relative to the core intervention;"" and (3) to simulate the cost savings resulting from the nationwide implementation of both interventions.

100,study of factors associated with cost and variation in prescribing among GPs,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing has the potential to harm both the individual and society. Previous research identified medical or demographic characteristics that influence prescription variation, but could not be changed. OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable factors associated with variance and cost of GP prescription. METHOD: Qualitative research methods were used in semi-structured recorded interviews with 17 GPs in Avon, South West NHS Region, UK. RESULTS: GPs were considered cautious and conservative prescribers. Prescribing decisions were often justified by the prescriber, despite conflicting clinical or cost arguments. A personally developed drug formulary was used to reduce dilemmas potentially associated with prescribing uncertainty. Willingness to reflect on and measure prescribing habits against established professional standards varied considerably. The absence of mechanisms for monitoring prescribing decisions, coupled with the underuse of the community pharmacist, led to uncertain prescribing outcomes. Some clinicians found it difficult to stay professionally current due to perceived time constraints. Excessive patient demand was seen as influencing their prescription, but GPs stated that they were not unduly influenced by the drug's representative. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing has a considerable impact on health and budgets, yet it remains a contentious issue. Better partnerships must be established between the patient, the doctor and the pharmacist. Better monitoring of prescribing decisions and support through policy development and educational intervention are needed to reduce prescribing uncertainty. Newly established Primary Care Groups may need to reflect on the difficulties prescribers face, particularly when prescribing within limited cash budgets, to avoid discord between prescribing behavior and local policy development.",0,0,
101,successful experiment to reduce unnecessary laboratory use in a community hospital,"series of interventions in a 228-bed general hospital provided physicians with regular information on the amount of laboratory services used to treat their patients. Laboratory test estimates adjusted for case mix allowed each physician to compare laboratory test use with that of their peers in the same department at the same hospital. Physicians with ""excessive"" practice patterns order hundreds more lab tests than average each year. A multifaceted educational program included the following: 1) ""meetings about costs and unnecessary lab tests"" were held; 2) physicians were given descriptions of their practice patterns relative to their peers as part of departmental discussions large and small; 3 ) the feedback was repeated a year later; 4) a consensus conference established guidelines for ordering tests;"" and 5) a sample of patient records was reviewed to determine the appropriateness of the request for laboratory tests. A total of 37% of a sample of tests ordered during the reference period by physicians with ""excessive"" practice patterns were classified as inappropriate. The intervention resulted in a reduction of 1.8 tests per patient (P = 0.0005). Eight of the nine tests individually showed reductions in use. The target hospital charge data showed a statistically significant reduction in laboratory charges per patient in the quarter after the start of the program (P = 0.02) and there was no evidence of change in a group of five comparison hospitals. There was no evidence of reductions in the ordering of essential tests.

102,"Survey of Primary Care Providers' Tobacco-Related Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors in Mississippi","RATIONALE: Compared to other regions of the US, Mississippi has a high prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related illness. This study evaluated the tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors of family physicians, dentists, and nurse practitioners in the state of Mississippi. METHODS: The Provider Attitude Survey, an 85-item measure of tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors, was mailed to all members of Mississippi family medicine, dentistry, and nurse practitioner professional organizations ( N=2043). RESULTS: More than one-third (n=802, 39.2%) of eligible providers responded. Only 24.3% had received training in smoking cessation and 33.7% knew the clinical practice guide of the Public Health Service. More than 90% indicated that their role was to prevent tobacco use ""they felt rewarded when they helped patients quit smoking""; and they were upset and upset about the effects of tobacco on health. Physicians attended more patients than nurses or dentists. Physicians and nurses reported more self-efficacy, motivation, and readiness to treat smoking than dentists. Providers with training performed more interventions and reported more self-efficacy, readiness, and fewer barriers than those without training. Training was associated with greater increases in self-efficacy, preparedness, and intervention behaviors for dentists than for the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related illness in Mississippi, primary care providers in Mississippi provide smoking cessation interventions at an unacceptably low frequency relative to other regions. Training is likely to increase the frequency of intervention behaviors.",0,0,
103,sustainable strategy to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections,"Background More than 50% of antibiotic prescriptions are for outpatients with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Many of them are not necessary and therefore contribute both to avoidable adverse events and to pressures towards the development of bacterial resistance. Could a clinical decision support system (CDSS), introduced at the time of electronic prescription, adjust the use of antibiotics towards the agreed treatment guidelines for ARIs? Methods This is a retrospective comparison of pre-intervention (2002) and post-intervention (2003-2006) periods in two comprehensive health care systems (intervention and control). The intervention was a CDSS targeting fluoroquinolone and azithromycin""; other antibiotics remained unrestricted. 7000 outpatient visits flagged by an ARI case detection algorithm were reviewed for consistency with guidelines (antibiotic prescribed when warranted). or not prescribed when not warranted) Results 3,831 patients met the case definitions for one or more ARIs: pneumonia (537), bronchitis (2,931), sinusitis (717), and nonspecific AKI (145). received antibiotics. The relative risk (RR) of consistent prescribing was 2.57 (95% CI = ?

104,systematic qualitative review of psychoeducational interventions for depression in cancer patients,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether research-based recommendations can be made on the clinical management of depression in cancer patients. DATA SOURCES: Reports of scientific studies, systematic qualitative or quantitative reviews of scientific studies, and practice guidelines published between 1980 and 2000. DATA SYNTHESIS: In total, 36 pieces of evidence supported the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions benefit depressive symptoms . The evidence included two well-conducted meta-analyses and nine well-designed randomized clinical trials with large samples (N > 100). Regarding the content of the intervention, 70% of the behavioral therapy studies and 66% of the counseling studies reached conclusions that supported the hypothesis. Additionally, 58% of studies evaluating behavioral therapy or counseling in combination with cancer education had positive results. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supports the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions reduce depressive symptoms in cancer patients and that behavioral therapy or counselling, alone or in combination with cancer education, is beneficial.

105,systematic review of clinical decision support systems for antimicrobial stewardship: are we failing to adequately investigate these interventions?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for antimicrobial management can help clinicians optimize antimicrobial therapy. We reviewed all of the original literature (qualitative and quantitative) to understand the current scope of CDSS for antimicrobial stewardship and discuss existing methods used to assess and report such systems. METHOD: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline, EMBASE, HMIC Health and Management, and Global Health databases were searched from January 1, 1980 to October 31, 2015. All primary research studies describing CDSS for antimicrobial stewardship in adults in primary or secondary care. For qualitative studies, a thematic synthesis was performed. Quality was assessed using the Integrated Quality Criteria for Review of Multiple Study Designs (ICROMS). The CDSS report was assessed against a reporting framework for the implementation of behavior change interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-eight original articles were included describing 38 independent CDSS. Most systems target antimicrobial prescribing (29/38""; 76%), are platforms integrated with electronic medical records (28/38; 74%), and have a rules-based infrastructure that supports prescription. decision making (29/38; ""76%). In the assessment against the intervention reporting framework, the CDSS studies do not report consideration of non-expert end-user workflow. They have a narrow focus, such as antimicrobial selection, and use indirect outcome measures. Commitment to CDSS by physicians was poor. CONCLUSION: Further consideration of factors driving non-expert decision making should be considered when designing CDSS interventions. Future work should aim to expand CDSS beyond simply selecting appropriate antimicrobials with clear and systematic reporting frameworks for CDSS interventions developed to address current gaps identified in evidence reporting.",0,1,
106,systematic review of computer-based patient record systems and quality of care: more randomized clinical trials or a broader approach?,"PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of computer-based patient record systems (CBPRS) on medical practice, quality of care, and user and patient satisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Manual and electronic search in Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases. STUDY SELECTION: Selected articles were published between 2000 and March 2003. CBPRS was defined as computer software designed to be used by clinicians as a direct aid in clinical decision making. To be included, the systems must have recorded patient characteristics and provided online advice, or specific information or reminders to physicians during consultation. DATA EXTRACTION: Keywords used for the search were: electronic record, computerized record, electronic medical record, electronic patient record, patient order entry, computer-based patient system, clinical decision support systems, and clinical evaluation. . RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were selected. The use of a CBPRS was perceived favorably by physicians, with satisfaction studies being mostly positive. A positive impact of CBPRS on preventive care was seen in all three studies that examined this criterion. The 12 studies that evaluated the impact on medical practice and adherence to guidelines showed that positive experiences were as common as experiences that showed no benefit. None of the six studies looking at the impact of CBPRS on patient outcomes reported any benefit. CONCLUSIONS: CBPRS increased user and patient satisfaction, which could lead to significant improvements in healthcare practices. However, studies on the impact of CBPRS on patient outcomes and quality of care have been inconclusive. Alternative approaches that consider social, cultural, and organizational factors may be needed to assess the usefulness of CBPRS.",0,0,

108,systematic review of faculty development initiatives designed to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education: BEME Guideline No. 8,"BACKGROUND: The preparation of health professionals for teaching is considered essential to improve the effectiveness of teaching. Although many reports describe various teacher development interventions, there is a paucity of research demonstrating their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the existing evidence that answers the question: ""What are the effects of teacher development interventions on the knowledge, attitudes and skills of teachers in medical education and on the institutions in which they work?"" METHODS: The search, which covered the period 1980-2002, included three databases (Medline, ERIC, and EMBASE) and used the keywords: ""staff development""; in-service training; medical faculty; faculty training/development ;"" continuing medical education. Manual searches were also performed. Articles focused on faculty development to improve teaching effectiveness, targeting basic and clinical scientists, were reviewed. All study designs that included outcome data beyond participant satisfaction were accepted. Of the initial 2,777 abstracts, 53 articles met the review criteria. Data were extracted by six coders, using the BEME standardized coding sheet, adapted for our use. Two reviewers coded each study and coding differences were resolved by discussion. Data was synthesized using Kirkpatrick's four levels of educational outcomes. Findings were grouped by type of intervention and described by outcome levels. In addition, 8 high-quality studies were analyzed in a 'focused image'. RESULTS: Most interventions targeted practicing physicians. All reports focused on teaching improvement and interventions included workshops, seminar series, short courses, longitudinal programs and 'other interventions'. Study designs included 6 randomized controlled trials and 47 quasi-experimental studies, of which 31 used a pre-post test design. KEY POINTS: Despite methodological limitations, the teacher development literature tends to support the following results: Overall satisfaction with teacher development programs was high. Participants consistently found the programs acceptable, useful, and relevant to their goals. Participants reported positive changes in attitudes towards teacher development and teaching. Participants reported increased knowledge of educational principles and gains in teaching skills. When formal tests of knowledge were used, significant gains were shown. Changes in teacher behavior were consistently reported by participants and were also detected by students. Changes in organizational practice and student learning were not frequently investigated. However, reported changes included increased educational participation and the establishment of collegial networks. Key characteristics of effective faculty development that contributed to effectiveness included the use of experiential learning, the provision of feedback, effective peer and colleague relationships, well-designed interventions following teaching and learning principles, and the use of a diversity of educational methods within individual interventions. Methodological issues: More rigorous designs and greater use of qualitative and mixed methods are needed to capture the complexity of interventions. Newer methods of performance-based evaluation, using a variety of data sources, should be explored, and reliable and valid outcome measures should be developed. Maintenance of change over time should also be considered, as should process-oriented studies comparing different teacher development strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Teacher development activities seem highly valued by participants, who also report changes in learning and behavior. Despite methodological limitations in the literature, certain program characteristics appear to be consistently associated with effectiveness. More research is required to explore these associations and document the results, at the individual and organizational levels.",0,0,
109,personalized intervention to implement guideline recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care: a pragmatic cluster randomized trial.,"Background Elderly patients with depression are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and at high risk for a chronic course. General practitioners adhere to clinical practice guidelines to a limited degree. In the international research project Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases, we test the efficacy of personalized interventions to improve the care of patients with chronic diseases. In Norway, we examined this approach to improve adherence to the six guideline recommendations for older people with depression, targeting health professionals, patients, and administrators. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized trial in 80 Norwegian municipalities. We identified the determinants of practice for six recommendations, and then tailored interventions to address these determinants. Interventions targeted health professionals, administrators, and patients and consisted of outreach visits, a website presenting the recommendations and underlying evidence, tools for managing depression in the elderly, and other web-based resources, including a continuing medical education course for general practitioners. The primary outcome was mean adherence to recommendations. Secondary outcomes were improvement in symptoms of depression as measured by patients and general practitioners. We offered outreach visits to all general practitioners and practice staff in the intervention municipalities. We used electronic software that pulled eligible patients from general practitioner lists. We collected data by interviewing general practitioners or sending them a questionnaire about their practice for four patients on their list and sending a questionnaire to the patients. Results One hundred and twenty-four of the 900 general practitioners (14%) participated in the data collection, 51 in the intervention group and 73 in the control group. We interviewed 77 general practitioners, 47 general practitioners completed the questionnaire and 134 patients responded to the questionnaire. Among general practitioners who provided data, adherence to recommendations was 1.6 percentage points higher in the intervention group than in the control group (95% CI -6 to 9). Conclusions The effectiveness of our personalized intervention to implement recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care is uncertain, due to the low response rate in data collection. However, it is unlikely that the effect was large. It remains uncertain how best to improve adherence to evidence-based recommendations and thus improve the quality of care for these patients.

110,teaching moment communication process for talking about smoking cessation: description of a clinician-focused randomized group intervention,"BACKGROUND: Effective physician-patient communication about health behavior change is one of the most important and most overlooked strategies for health promotion and disease prevention. Existing guidelines for specific behavioral health counseling have been created and promulgated, but have not been successfully adopted in primary care practice. Building on work focused on creating effective clinical strategies to drive health behavior change in the primary care setting, we developed an intervention aimed at improving clinicians' communication skills to create and act on teachable moments for give up smoking. In this manuscript, we describe the development and implementation of the Teachable Moment Communication Process (TMCP) intervention and baseline characteristics of a cluster randomized trial designed to assess its effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: This cluster randomized trial includes thirty-one community-based primary care physicians practicing in Northeast Ohio and 840 of their adult patients. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive the Teachable Moments Communication Process (TMCP) intervention for smoking cessation or the delayed intervention. The TMCP intervention consisted of two 3-hour educational training sessions that included didactic presentations, skill demonstration through video examples, skill practice with standardized patients, and feedback from peers and trainers. For each physician enrolled, 12 patients were recruited at two time points. Pre- and post-intervention data were collected from physicians, patients, and audio-recorded physician-patient interactions. At baseline, the two groups of physicians and their patients were similar with respect to all demographic and practice characteristics examined. Physician and patient recruitment goals were met, and retention was 96% and 94%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Findings support the feasibility of training clinicians in the use of the Teachable Moments Communication Process. The next steps are to assess how well clinicians employ these skills within their practices and to assess the effect on patient outcomes.

111,telephone counseling intervention to improve asthma self-management behaviors,"Long recognizing that asthma, one of the most common chronic childhood illnesses, is difficult to manage, the National Asthma Prevention Education Program developed clinical practice guidelines to help health care providers, particularly those in the primary care setting. However, maintenance asthma care still does not meet national standards. Therefore, in an attempt to improve and support asthma self-management behaviors for parents of children aged 5 to 12 years with persistent asthma, a new telephone nurse advice intervention was tested in a randomized controlled trial. A detailed description of the intervention is provided along with parent satisfaction results, an overview of the training used to prepare nurses, and a discussion of challenges experienced and lessons learned.",0,0,
112,theory of international bioethics: the negotiable and the non-negotiable,"The previous article in this issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal makes the case that ""moral fundamentalism,"" the position that international bioethics is based on ""basic"" or ""fundamental"" moral principles that are universally accepted in all ages and cultures, collapses under a variety of postmodern and multicultural critiques. This article looks to the contractualist tradition of Hobbes and Locke, reinterpreted by David Gauthier, Robert Nozick, and John Rawls, for an alternative justification for international bioethics. Building on the central themes of this tradition, it is argued that international bioethics can be rationally reconstructed as a negotiated moral order that respects culturally and individually defined areas of non-negotiability. Furthermore, the theory of a negotiated moral order is consistent with traditional ideals about human rights, is flexible enough to absorb the genuine ideas of multiculturalism and postmodernism, and yet is strong enough to justify cross-cultural moral judgments and transtemporal, including the condemnation of the Nazis. doctors in Nuremberg. This theory is also consistent with the history of the ethics of human subject experimentation and provides information on current controversies, such as the controversy over changing the consent rule for experiments in emergency medicine and the controversy over the exemption of certain clinical trials of economic treatments to prevent perinatal. transmission of AIDS from the ethical standards of the sponsoring country.",0,0,
113,theory-based educational intervention targeting nurses' attitudes and knowledge about cancer-related pain management: a quasi-experimental design study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common problems among patients diagnosed with cancer. Despite the availability of effective pharmacological treatments, this group of patients often receives less than optimal treatment. Research on nurses' pain management highlights certain factors, such as lack of knowledge and attitudes and inadequate procedures for systematic pain assessment, as common barriers to effective pain management. However, educational interventions directed at pain management by nurses have shown promise. Since cancer-related pain is also known to have a negative effect on vital aspects of a patient's life, as well as being commonly associated with problems such as sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety, further development is warranted. of knowledge in this area. METHODS/DESIGN: A quasi-experimental study design will be used to investigate whether the implementation of guidelines for routine daily pain assessments after a theory-based educational intervention will result in improved knowledge and attitude among nurses. Another objective is to investigate if the intervention directed at the behavior of nurses will improve the perception of pain in hospital patients. Data on nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards pain (primary outcome), patient perception of pain (secondary outcome), along with sociodemographic variables, will be collected at baseline and at four weeks and 12 weeks later. of the intervention. DISCUSSION: Nursing care is nowadays recognized as an increasingly complicated activity and ""the complexity of nursing is such that it can be seen as the complex intervention par excellence"". In order to change and improve clinical practice, multiple appropriate points of attack are required to address complex challenges. Consequently, we expect that the theory-based intervention used in our quasi-experimental study will improve care and quality of life for this patient group, and we also anticipate that evidence-based guidelines targeting pain for this patient group will be more widely implemented. widely.

114,tool to assess a community's capacity for substance abuse care,"Evidence-based programs for substance abuse prevention and intervention are on the rise. Community Needs Assessments and Health Classifications provide descriptions of local behavioral health needs, but do not provide public health professionals and policymakers with guidance on the number of programs, health professionals or interventions needed in the local substance abuse care system. This article presents a new framework for measuring and evaluating the substance abuse care system in a community. Assessment can inform resource allocation across the continuum of care to distribute interventions and care more equitably and efficiently. We conducted 2 reviews of the literature and synthesized our findings to create a community assessment methodology and needs calculator, CAST (Calculation for Appropriate System Tool). We reviewed 212 articles to produce an inventory of the community and social correlates of behavioral health, the components of a substance abuse system of care, and the numerical values of the guidelines for estimating community needs. CAST produces community-specific assessments of the capacity of the components of a community substance abuse system of care. CAST generates recommendations by applying social and community determinants of health as risk ratios to each estimate of component needs. CAST can assist public health professionals in evaluating and improving the capacity of community-based substance abuse care systems. By using recommendations for component needs across the continuum of care, community leaders can use CAST to prioritize resource allocation more effectively and efficiently.",0,0,
115,universal precautions education intervention for health workers in Sardjito and PKU Hospital Indonesia,"nonrandomized control trial was conducted to develop and evaluate a detailed culturally appropriate academic intervention on universal precautions knowledge, attitude, and behavior of health care workers in hospitals. Fifty-five health workers (44 nurses and 11 doctors) participated in the study. They were visited individually to discuss the principles of universal precautions, as well as the effect of autopilot on their work practices. Self-reported measures of knowledge and attitudes were collected from each participant before and after the intervention. Measures of participants' adherence to universal precautions guidelines were collected by a nurse observer according to a predetermined protocol before and after the intervention. There was a significantly different level of knowledge, attitudes and compliance with universal precautions between the control and intervention hospital with p=0.0007, p=0.038 and p=0.03 respectively after the intervention. It is concluded that a detailed academic approach to education used in this study has significantly improved knowledge, attitudes and compliance scores.",0,0,
116,cluster randomized trial of decision support strategies to reduce antibiotic use in acute bronchitis,"Background National quality indicators show little change in antibiotic overuse for acute uncomplicated bronchitis. We compared the effect of 2 decision support strategies on antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis. Methods We conducted a 3-arm cluster randomized trial among 33 primary care practices within an integrated health care system in central Pennsylvania. Print decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support for acute cough illness through a print-based strategy, computer aided decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support from decisions through an electronic medical record-based strategy, with control sites (11 practices) serving as the control arm. Both intervention sites also received physician education and feedback on prescribing practices, as well as patient education brochures at registration. Antibiotic prescription rates for acute uncomplicated bronchitis in the winter period (October 1, 2009, to March 31, 2010) after the introduction of the intervention were compared with the previous 3 winter periods in an analysis by intention to treat. Results Compared to the baseline period, the percentage of adolescents and adults who were prescribed antibiotics during the intervention period decreased in the printed decision support intervention sites (from 80.0% to 68.3% ) and at computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (from 74.0% to 68.3%). 60.7%) but increased slightly at control sites (from 72.5% to 74.3%). After controlling for patient and physician characteristics, as well as grouping of observations by physician and practice site, differences for intervention sites were statistically significant from control sites (P = 0.003 for intervention sites). control vs. print decision support intervention sites and P = 0.01 for control sites vs. computer aided decision support intervention sites), but not between them (P = 0, 67 for paper-based decision support intervention sites vs. computer-aided decision support intervention sites). Changes in total visits, 30-day follow-up visit rates, and the proportion diagnosed with uncomplicated acute bronchitis were similar across study sites. Conclusions Implementation of a decision support strategy for acute bronchitis may help reduce overuse of antibiotics in primary care settings. The effect of print versus computer-assisted decision support strategies in providing decision support was equivalent.",1,1,
117,Adult Personality and Behavior Abnormalities (Section F 6): ICD-10 Field Test Results,"Personality disorders, the most important category in section F6, were studied in the ICD-10 field test. The overall Kappa values for the inter-rater reliability of the F6 section are 0.64, for personality disorders 0.61 and for antisocial personality 0.73. These results are very similar to those of the DSM-III field tests. Subjective assessments of feasibility, suitability, and goodness of fit demonstrate good acceptance of diagnostic guidelines by clinicians. A comparison of ICD-9, DSM-III, and ICD-10 diagnoses yielded broad agreement for personality disorder diagnoses with overlapping Kappa values of 0.91 and 0.94. The acceptance and reliability of the new classification could be increased through a series of improvements and the planned introduction of a multi-axial system.",0,0,
118,Academic details have no effect on asthma medication prescription in Danish general practice: a 3-year randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-ups,"BACKGROUND: Educational outreach visits, particularly when combined with social marketing, appear to be a promising approach to modifying the behavior of health professionals, especially prescribing. The results of previous studies have shown a variable effect. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of academic details as a method of implementing a clinical guideline in general practice. METHODS: A blinded, controlled, cluster-randomized study of the effect of an academic in-depth visit compared with postal distribution of an asthma medication prescribing guide was conducted. Half of the practices in a Danish county with 100 practices were visited once. The outcome measure was routinely collected from data from all Danish pharmacies on asthma drug sales. Data were collected monthly from 2 years before to 1 year after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no effect on asthma medication prescription pattern after the visit, either immediately or in the long term. CONCLUSION: We found no effect of academic details as a single intervention.",0,0,

122,Achieving change in primary care: causes of the evidence-practice gap: systematic reviews of reviews,"Background This study aims to identify, summarize and synthesize the literature on the causes of the gap between evidence and practice for complex interventions in primary care. Design This study is a systematic review of reviews. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO, from inception to December 2013. Eligible reviews addressed the causes of the gap between evidence and practice in primary care in developed countries. Data from included reviews were extracted and synthesized using guidelines for metasynthesis. Results Seventy reviews met the inclusion criteria and covered a wide range of topics, for example guideline implementation, integration of new roles, technology implementation, public health and preventive medicine. None of the included articles used the term 'cause' or stated an intention to investigate causes. A descriptive approach was often used, with the included documents expressing 'causes' in terms of 'barriers and facilitators' to implementation. We developed a four-tier framework that encompasses the external context, the organization, the practitioners, and the intervention. External contextual factors included policies, incentive structures, dominant paradigms, stakeholder engagement, infrastructure, and technological advances. Organizational factors included culture, available resources, integration with existing processes, relationships, skill mix, and staff involvement. At the level of individual professionals, professional role, underlying philosophy of care, and competencies were important. Intervention characteristics that impacted implementation included evidence of benefit, ease of use, and adaptability to local circumstances. We postulate that the ""fit"" between the intervention and the context is critical in determining the success of implementation. Conclusions This comprehensive review of reviews summarizes current knowledge about the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of various complex interventions in primary care. To maximize the uptake of complex interventions in primary care, health professionals and lead organizations need to consider the range of contextual factors, being aware of the dynamic nature of the context. Future studies should place an emphasis on describing the context and articulating the relationships between the factors identified here.",0,0,
123,Achieving guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care: is physician education enough?,"OBJECTIVES: The authors examine whether medical education has lasting effects in the treatment of depression. METHODS: Depressed primary care patients initiating antidepressant treatment in primary care clinics of a staff model health maintenance organization were studied. Quasi-experimental and before-and-after comparisons of medical practices, supplemented by patient surveys, were used to compare process of care and depression outcomes. The intervention consisted of extensive medical education spanning a 12-month period. This included case-by-case consultation, didactics, academic details (eg, clearly stating educational and behavioral goals for individual clinicians), and optimal treatment role-playing. The main outcome measures were divided into two groups. Quasi-experimental samples included: (1) antidepressant medication selection and (2) appropriateness (dose and duration) of pharmacotherapy. Survey samples included: (3) intensity of follow-up""; (4) physician delivered educational messages about treating depression; (5) patient satisfaction""; and (6) depression outcomes. RESULTS: No consistent lasting educational effect was observed for any of the outcomes measured. CONCLUSIONS: There was no lasting improvement in the treatment of depression for primary care patients. However, depression treatment guidelines were achieved at the same time for intervention patients enrolled in a multifaceted collaborative care program during the training period. These results suggest that ongoing service delivery programs reorganized to support the role of a primary care physician (eg, on-site mental health staff, close monitoring of patient progress and compliance), in addition to training are essential for the successful implementation of the guideline.",0,0,
124,Action to stop smoking in case of suspected tuberculosis (ASSIST) in Pakistan,"Background: Tobacco use is responsible for a large proportion of the total burden of tuberculosis disease. Pakistan is one of the 10 countries with a high burden of tuberculosis and tobacco use. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a behavioral support intervention and bupropion in achieving continuous abstinence for 6 months in adult smokers with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Design: Controlled, randomized cluster trial. (Current controlled trials: ISRCTN08829879) Setting: Health centers in Jhang and Sargodha districts in Pakistan. Patients: 1955 adult smokers with suspected tuberculosis. Intervention: Health centers were randomized to provide 2 brief sessions of behavioral support (BSS), BSS plus 7 weeks of bupropion therapy (BSS+), or usual care. Measurements: The primary end point was continued abstinence at 6 months after the quit date and was determined by carbon monoxide levels in the patients. Secondary endpoints were timely abstinence at 1 and 6 months. Results: Both treatments resulted in statistically significant relative risks (RRs) for abstinence compared with usual care (RR for BSS+, 8.2 [95% CI, 3.7 to 18.2]""; ""RR for BSS, 7.4 [CI, 3.4 to 16.4]). Equivalence between treatments could not be established. In the BSS+ group, 275 of 606 patients (45.4% [CI, 41.4% to 49.4%]) achieved continuous abstinence compared with 254 of 620 (41.0% [CI, 37.1% to 45.0%]) in the BSS group and 52 of 615 (8.5% [CI, 6.4% to 10.9%]) in the usual care group. There was substantial heterogeneity of program effects between groups. Limitations: Imbalances in urban and rural proportions and smoking habits between treatment groups, and inability to confirm adherence to bupropion treatment and validate long-term abstinence or the effect of smoking cessation on tuberculosis outcomes. . Conclusion: Behavioral support alone or in combination with bupropion is effective in promoting smoking cessation in smokers with suspected tuberculosis.

From randomized clinical trials, to consensus guidelines, to clinical practice in Italy: the need to close the circle","Recent therapeutic advances in the treatment of acute ischemic heart disease have been tested by randomized clinical trials and approved by formal practice guidelines. This rigorous approach has led to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, contemporary non-ST elevation ACS registries established by the cardiology community in Italy, as well as in the rest of Europe and America, have shown only limited compliance with the general indication to treat high-risk patients with a early treatment. invasive approach protected by the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers. This partial failure in the process of improving patient care can be attributed to several reasons, including suspicion that practice guidelines may be biased by conflict of interest, concern about the applicability of clinical trial results to real world, unrealistic expectations about treatment, and finally, logistical and financial hurdles, including the availability of cath labs and the high cost of platelet receptor blockers. Although practice guidelines can provide cultural support for translating clinical research results into patient care, and national and local cardiology associations can help raise awareness of the real benefits of an early aggressive approach in high-risk patients. risk, health care managers must remove bureaucratic hurdles and reallocate resources from treatments of unproven benefit to those that have been clearly shown to reduce mortality and reinfarction risk in patients with ACS.",0,0,
127,Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and computed tomography diagnosis,"39-year-old woman was admitted to a maternity unit at 34 weeks' gestation with nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. Her condition deteriorated and she was taken to hospital, profoundly unconscious and hypotensive. The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was initially suggested by the typical history of prodromal discomfort and vomiting and the rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy with profound hypoglycemia and only small increases in transaminase activities. Computed tomography was performed: there was no enlargement of the liver or spleen, but the attenuation value over the liver indicated appreciable fatty infiltration of the liver, establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Computed tomography has value in the diagnosis of liver disease in late pregnancy, and this technique may become the method of choice for the investigation of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",0,0,

129,Adding exercise or subtracting sitting time for glycemic control: where are we?,"While regular structured exercise is a well-established (albeit possibly underused) cornerstone in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes, population adherence to recommended exercise guidelines remains stubbornly low. In fact, most adults are exposed to environmental settings—at work, in car travel, and in the home environment—that can not only limit their physical activity, but also promote prolonged sitting. However, recent experimental evidence indicates that reducing and dividing the time spent sitting may also be a useful strategy for improving glycemic control. In this issue of Diabetologia, Duvivier and colleagues report findings suggesting that reducing time spent sitting, standing, and low-intensity activities could be a potential alternative to structured exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We review and discuss the findings of this study, their potential clinical implications, and a number of knowledge gaps and opportunities that might be considered in the interest of future research. Duvivier and colleagues' findings should encourage health professionals, researchers, and patients with type 2 diabetes to consider the full spectrum of physical activity, from sedentary behavior to structured exercise.",0,0,
130,Adding motivational interventions to exercise and traditional physiotherapy: review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Undisputed epidemiological trends indicate that, for the foreseeable future, mortality and morbidity will be dominated by an escalation of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. International guidelines recommend the implementation of evidence-based approaches to achieve changes in health behavior. Motivational interventions to increase adherence and physical activity are not part of traditional physical therapy for any condition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the evidence for the effectiveness of adding motivational interventions to traditional physical therapy to increase physical activity and short- and long-term compliance with exercise prescriptions. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED, and the Allied Health Evidence database using keywords and subject titles. STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized controlled trials comparing two or more arms, with one arm focusing on motivational interventions influencing exercise and one control arm, were included. The search identified 493 titles, of which 14 studies (with 1504 participants) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by the principal investigator and independently reviewed by another author. Two authors independently assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the PEDro scale. Outcomes were measured in level of impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. The standardized mean difference between control and intervention groups at follow-up time points was used as the mode of analysis. I2</=50% was used as the cut-off point for acceptable heterogeneity, above which a random effects model was applied. RESULTS: Exercise attendance was measured in six studies (n=378), and the results indicate that there were no significant differences in exercise attendance between groups (random-effects model, standardized mean difference 0.33, interval 95% confidence: -0.03 to 0.68, I2 62%). Perceived self-efficacy results from six studies (n = 722) were combined, finding a significant difference between groups in favor of the interventions (fixed effect model, standardized mean difference 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.87, I2 41%). The results for levels of activity limitation (n=550) were combined and found a significant difference between groups in favor of the interventions (SMR, standardized mean difference -0.37, 95% confidence interval - 0.65 to -0.08, I(2) 61%). LIMITATIONS: Most of the included studies were of medium quality and four studies were of low quality. Data was pooled from a wide variety of different populations and settings, which increased the range of study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interventions may help exercise adherence, have a positive effect on long-term exercise behavior, improve self-efficacy, and reduce levels of activity limitation. The optimal choice of theory and the most beneficial duration and type of intervention have not been defined, although all interventions showed benefits. There is a need to determine how practicing physiotherapists currently optimize adherence and their current levels of knowledge about motivational interventions. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Results indicate that motivational interventions are successful in increasing healthy physical activity behaviour. Physiotherapists are ideally placed to take on this role, and motivational interventions should become part of physiotherapy practice.",0,0,

132,Compliance with NICE diabetes prevention guidelines in the UK: effect on patient knowledge and perceived risk,"BACKGROUND: NICE guidelines for diabetes prevention include identifying people at risk followed by cost-effective intervention if necessary. Based on risk assessment through a questionnaire and/or blood tests, intervention may comprise a brief discussion of risk factors and preventive counseling or referral for intensive lifestyle intervention. DESIGN AND SETTING: In this cross-sectional study, 59 subjects recruited from local GP practices were invited by letter to attend a screening for a diabetes prevention study. METHOD: After a telephone screening during which subjects were asked if they had been informed if they were at high risk for type 2 diabetes, eligible subjects completed a Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes (RPS-DD), a validated diabetes risk score and underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at a medical examination. RESULTS: As measured by the Diabetes UK Risk Score, 44.1% were at high risk, 42.4% at moderate risk, and 13.6% at increased risk. 42% of the patients had been informed that they were at high risk by a health professional. Those who had been informed of their risk had significantly higher perceived risk scores (p<0.001), higher knowledge scores (p<0.001), and decreased optimism scores (p=0.004), but were no more aware that diet (p=0.42) and weight control (p=0.57) may play a role in diabetes prevention.

133,teen contraception,"PIP: Many adolescent girls in the United States continue to be at risk of unintended pregnancy despite advances in contraceptive technology and the increased availability of contraceptive methods. Physicians caring for adolescents should be familiar with the various contraceptive measures and their appropriateness for adolescents. A health professional should also be prepared to engage in sex education and counsel or refer individual adolescent patients when sexual problems arise. Attention in this discussion of contraception in adolescents is directed to the following: reasons not to use contraception, postcoital contraception, oral contraception (contraindications, side effects, guidelines for use in adolescents and the minipill (progestin only), IUDs, diaphragms, chemical vaginal contraceptives, condoms, abstinence or rhythm, intervention techniques, and appropriate method selection The average adolescent is exposed to unprotected intercourse for a year or more before seeking contraception Available evidence suggests that today's adolescents may be using contraceptives more than ever before, however, a significant number do not use a method for a variety of reasons Most reasons reflect lack of knowledge, some reflect lack of availability Reasons include ignorance of fertile periods, the belief that their age is protective, sexual intercourse recount or not, and strong feelings of guilt evoked by the idea of being prepared for the possibility of sexual intercourse. Many teens are hesitant to seek birth control advice or prescriptions from private doctors because they fear morality lectures and rejection of their requests. There is evidence in at least 1 study that locating the family planning clinic within the school is effective in reducing pregnancy rates and ensuring high continuation rates after 36 months of follow-up. Intervention techniques that might be effective include providing a method immediately after an event (abortion, childbirth, rape) when motivation is highest and tailoring the method to individual lifestyle and preference. If there are no contraindications, the adolescent should be given the preferred method and a method that suits the frequency of intercourse. A backup method should also be provided if the preferred method is not tolerated or never started. To maximize continuation rates, frequent follow-up is essential.",0,0,

135,Teen Violence Prevention Practices Among California Pediatricians,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the provision of violence prevention services by pediatricians to their adolescent patients and to identify factors associated with the implementation of these services by pediatricians. DESIGN: A cross-sectional sample of California pediatricians completed a self-report questionnaire. The theoretical model ""Precede/Proceed"" guided the questionnaire in the identification of factors associated with the screening practices and intervention of pediatricians in the prevention of adolescent violence. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatricians (54% female, 66% white, 24% Asian, 5% Latino, and 5% other) participated in the study. On average, participants screened their patients for violence-related risk factors 31% of the time for fighting, 39% of the time for domestic violence, and 29% of the time for carrying weapons . Participants provided their at-risk patients with violence-related interventions less than 50% of the time (on average) by implementing the following interventions: written materials, follow-up appointments, disciplinary counseling, or referral to a community organization, Child Protective Services, or a clinic specialized in adolescents. Factors associated with violence prevention screening practices included the following: positive attitudes and beliefs regarding violence screening, familiarity with violence prevention guidelines, use of prompts in medical records, perceptions increased skills and positive reinforcement of patients and colleagues for providing violence prevention services. (R(2)=0.44""; P<0.001). Factors associated with violence prevention intervention practices included: positive attitudes and beliefs in detecting violence, availability of resources, and positive reinforcement of patients and colleagues for providing violence prevention services (R(2)=0.37;” p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: California pediatricians are not extensively screening their adolescent patients for risk factors associated with adolescent violence, nor do they provide interventions to their adolescent patients who may be at risk for violence Factors associated with implementation of violence prevention services by pediatricians can aid in the development of effective interventions designed to improve the provision of these services to their adolescent patients.",0,0,

We looked at how practices integrated MOHR into their workflows, what additional practice staff time was required, and what percentage of patients completed a MOHR (Scope) assessment. RESULTS: Most practices addressed (60%) agreed to adopt MOHR. How they implemented MOHR depended on practice resources, computing capacity, and patient characteristics. Three practices sent invitations to patients to complete MOHRs on the web, 1 called patients and completed MOHRs over the phone, 1 had patients complete paper MOHRs in the office, and 4 had staff help patients complete MOHRs on the web in the office. In total, 3,591 patients were approached and 1,782 completed MOHR (reach = 49.6%). Reach varied by implementation strategy, with greater reach when the MOHR was completed by staff than by patients (71.2% vs. 30.2%, p < 0.001). No practice was able to sustain the full MOHR assessment without accommodations after study completion. Fielding MOHR increased staff and physician time by an average of 28 minutes per visit. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices can implement behavioral health and mental health assessments, but counseling patients effectively requires effort. Practices will need more support to implement and sustain assessments.",0,1,
137,Palliative care adult education program for nursing facility physicians: design and pilot test,"Nursing facilities (NFs) are important sites for the care of dying patients. Curricula that can improve end-of-life care for NF physicians are needed. To this end, a model medical school palliative care curriculum for physicians with experience in NF was modified. Adult learning techniques were emphasized, as well as interactions likely to change clinician behavior. Opinion leader inclusion, feedback auditing, use of consensus guidelines, and other techniques to change physician behavior were included. Written materials were identified to complement the course. This new program was tested and improved. An initial audit of medical practices and a survey of NF staff, a half-day adult education session, and follow-up with the NF medical director are suggested. This intervention should be tested to determine if it improves outcomes of patient end-of-life care in this setting.",0,0,

139,Advancing the literature on the design of audit and feedback interventions: identification of theory-based hypotheses,"Background Audit and feedback (A&F) is a common strategy to help healthcare providers implement evidence into practice. Despite being extensively studied, health care A&F interventions continue to have variable efficacy, with overall effects not improving since 2003. Contributing to this stagnation is the fact that most health care A&F interventions are they have designed largely without being informed by theoretical understanding of behavior. and social sciences. To determine if the trend can be improved, the aim of this study was to develop a list of testable hypotheses based on theory about how to design more effective C&F interventions. Methods Using purposive sampling, 60- to 90-minute semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with experts in A&F-related theories from a variety of fields (eg, cognitive, health, and organizational psychology, medical decision-making, economics). . Guided by detailed descriptions of A&F interventions from the health care literature, interviewees described how they would approach the problem of designing better A&F interventions. Specific theory-based hypotheses about the conditions for the effective design and implementation of C&F interventions were drawn from the interviews. The resulting hypotheses were assigned by three coders working independently on themes and theme categories, in an iterative process. Results We conducted 28 interviews and identified 313 theory-based hypotheses, which were located in 30 themes. The 30 themes included hypotheses related to the following five categories: A&F recipient (seven themes), A&F content (ten themes), A&F delivery process (six themes), A&F focused behavior (three themes), and others (four topics). Conclusions We have identified a set of testable hypotheses based on theory from a wide range of behavioral and social sciences that suggest conditions for more effective A&F interventions. This work demonstrates the breadth of perspectives on A&F from disciplines not specific to health care in a way that generates testable hypotheses for A&F interventions in health care. These results will serve as the basis for future work seeking to establish research priorities within the A&F research community.",0,0,

141,Advantages and challenges of a village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in old age in rural China: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: The provision of mental health services in rural China has been severely limited due to a lack of qualified mental health professionals, among other hindering factors. A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way to improve accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, delivered by trained local clinicians, to treat depression in old age in rural China. METHODS: We conducted a focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The thematic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded with NVivo 8, and analyzed with thematic analysis. RESULTS: Village doctors highlighted the importance of role-playing and the use of instruction manuals in training. Adequate supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elderly were positive, so that both the doctors and the elderly were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (requirements and perceived political consideration) facilitated the elderly's access to mental health services. Challenges included the lack of real therapy (in contrast to role play) demonstrated in the training and the lack of a step-by-step manual based on the different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of the village doctors and the presence of other people when performing the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable intervention for geriatric depression in rural China if several challenges are adequately addressed.",0,0,
142,Counseling patients seeking complementary and alternative medical therapies for cancer,"Many cancer patients use complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies. Physicians need reliable information about CAM therapies to responsibly advise patients seeking these interventions. This article summarizes the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of selected CAM therapies that are commonly used by cancer patients. The following main categories of interventions are covered: dietary modification and supplements, herbal products and other biological agents, acupuncture, massage, exercise, and psychological and mind-body therapies. Two categories of evidence on efficacy are considered: potential effects on disease progression and survival, and potential palliative effects. When evaluating the evidence on safety, two types of risk are considered: the risk of direct adverse effects and the risk of interactions with conventional treatments. For each therapy, the current balance of evidence on efficacy and safety points to whether the therapy can be reasonably recommended, accepted (for example, reducing dietary fat in well-nourished patients with breast or prostate cancer), or discouraged (for example, example, high-dose vitamin A supplementation). This strategy enables the development of an approach to providing responsible, evidence-based, patient-centered counseling to people with cancer seeking CAM therapies.",0,0,

145,Participation and enjoyment of alcohol- and non-alcohol-related activities among college students: An analysis of behavioral choice theories.,"Alcohol abuse among college students remains a major public health problem, and there is a need for empirical and theory-based models to guide prevention efforts. Behavioral choice theories assume that the decision to consume alcohol is influenced by the relative value of alcohol versus other available activities. In the present study, a sample of drinking college students (N=108"";"" 56% female, 44% male) who had previously completed a mandatory alcohol intervention completed a measure of participation in and enjoyment of alcohol-related activities and without alcohol. The aims of the study were to examine the influence of drinking quantity and contextual variables on activity enjoyment and to identify non-alcoholic enjoyable activities that take place on nights when students might be drinking. In general, students found alcohol-related activities more enjoyable than non-alcoholic activities, and the amount of drinking was positively related to enjoyment. However, non-alcoholic activities, such as watching movies, going to the theater or museums, going to bars or parties, hanging out with friends, eating in restaurants, and participating in creative activities, were generally just as enjoyable as drinking. Non-alcoholic activities that included partners or dates were more enjoyable than solitary activities. Men were less likely to participate in non-alcoholic activities that included partners and reported less enjoyment related to non-alcoholic activities than women. More research is required to identify procedures for increasing participation in non-alcoholic activities and to determine whether increased participation in non-alcoholic activities results in decreased alcohol consumption.

146,Everything you need to read in the other general magazines,"Between 1998 and 2009, a single surgeon in France reconstructed the genitalia of 2,938 women who had been mutilated or cut as children. The case series, one of the largest to date, suggests that surgery may help at least some women with a history of female genital mutilation achieve an acceptable, pain-free sex life. Most of the women were from French-speaking West Africa, although more than 564 had undergone female genital mutilation while growing up in France. Almost all of them wanted surgery, above all, to recover their feminine identity and autonomy. Four-fifths were also looking for a better sex life. All had undergone female genital mutilation that removed or damaged the clitoris, at a mean age of 6 years. One of the goals of the surgery was to reconstruct a normal clitoris. More than three quarters of women presenting for surgery (78% (2053/2613)) had never had an orgasm. Only 866 women (29%) returned for follow-up one year after surgery. About half (414/840) reported improvements in pain. Slightly fewer reported improvements in sexual pleasure (385/834), and 430 now had orgasms.

147,Non-adherence to the alliance: training strategies to improve outcomes in type 2 diabetes.,"PURPOSE: To explore strategies to improve outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: Literature related to type 2 diabetes management, behavior change, communication, diabetes self-management, and training. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies currently suggested to improve patient outcomes, for example, increasing provider adherence to evidence-based management guidelines, simplifying practice systems, and promoting lifestyle changes for patients through through intensive education, have produced mixed results. Of the many complexities involved in managing type 2 diabetes, motivating patients to change their behavior can be the most challenging. One suggestion to improve self-management for patients with type 2 diabetes is to use counseling communication within a behavior change framework in the context of the primary care encounter between nurse practitioners (NPs) and their patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Given the varied results of current strategies, NP training may provide a feasible alternative to improve outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes. Coaching communication can be implemented during office visits as a free intervention. However, to implement this approach effectively, practicing NPs and NP students need more formal education in this expected but underdeveloped NP role competency. NPs are called upon to contribute to the body of knowledge necessary to validate the merits of coaching for their patients.",0,0,
148,Alprazolam prescribing in Tasmania: a dual intervention designed to reduce inappropriate prescribing and concomitant opioid prescribing,"OBJECTIVE: The population prescribing rate for alprazolam in Tasmania has been more than twice the national rates. Serious adverse events have been observed through the co-administration of opioid medications with alprazolam. A dual intervention, comprising GP education along with changes in prescribing norms, was designed with the intention of reducing inappropriate alprazolam prescribing and thus reducing adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the intervention on prescription rates. METHOD: We measured the number of alprazolam prescriptions in the years before and after the intervention. Data from the Health Insurance Commission were used to allow comparison of subsidized prescribing rates for alprazolam in Tasmania and national data. Participants were Tasmanian registered physicians who were potential prescribers of alprazolam. The interventions were three GP educational meetings during June 2007, one in each of the major regions of Tasmania, regarding evidence-based interventions for panic disorder. In September 2007, changes in regulatory procedures were implemented to minimize the co-prescription of alprazolam with opioids. RESULTS: There was a reduction in alprazolam prescription in Tasmania after the interventions. CONCLUSION: Education can be an effective strategy to influence the prescribing behavior of physicians. It is likely that this effect can be increased by the adoption of more stringent regulatory requirements.",0,0,

153,American Medical Society of Sports Medicine Position Statement: Concussion in Sports,"NO LABEL: PURPOSE OF STATEMENT: Black triangle at right To provide an evidence-based summary of best practices to assist clinicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. black triangle on the right To establish the level of evidence, knowledge gaps and areas that require further investigation. IMPORTANCE OF AN AMSSM STATEMENT: black triangle on the right Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of sports concussion patients. black triangle at right Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care throughout the sports concussion from the acute injury to return to play (RTP) decisions. black triangle on right Care of concussed athletes in sport is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in concussion assessment and management. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. right black triangle While this statement is intended for sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and health care professionals caring for sports concussion patients. DEFINITION: right black triangle Concussion is defined as a transient traumatically induced disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI) that is generally self-limited and is on the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: black triangle on right Animal and human studies support the concept of post-concussion vulnerability and show that a second shock before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell . black triangle at right Experimental evidence suggests that the concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before full recovery, the brain may be vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction. INCIDENCE: Black triangle at right It is estimated that up to 3.8 million concussions occur in the US each year during competitive sports and recreational activities"";"" however, up to 50% of concussions may go undetected. black triangle on the right Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS: Black triangle at right A history of concussion is associated with an increased risk of another concussion. black triangle on right Increased number, severity, and duration of symptoms after concussion are predictors of prolonged recovery. black triangle on the right In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of concussions is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. black triangle on the right Certain sports, positions and individual styles of play have a higher risk of concussion. black triangle on the right Young athletes may have a longer recovery time and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. black triangle on right Pre-injury mood disorders, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder (ADD/ADHD), and migraines complicate the diagnosis and treatment of a concussion. DIAGNOSIS OF CONCUSSION: Black triangle to the right Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a health care provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in concussion recognition and evaluation. black triangle on right Graded Symptom Checklists provide an objective tool for evaluating a variety of concussion-related symptoms, while also tracking the severity of those symptoms in serial assessments. black triangle at right Standardized assessment tools provide a useful framework for concussion assessment, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available. SIDELINE ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT: Black triangle to the right Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be detained and evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in the assessment and management of concussions. black triangle on right Recognition and initial evaluation of a concussion should be guided by a symptom checklist, cognitive assessment (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning, and concentration), balance tests, and a physical examination additional neurological right black triangle While secondary standardized tests are a useful framework for screening, the sensitivity, specificity, validity, and reliability of these tests across different age groups, cultural groups, and settings is largely undefined. Its practical utility with or without an individual reference test is also largely unknown. black triangle on the right Impaired balance is a specific indicator of a concussion, but not a very sensitive one. Sideline balance tests may be substantially different from baseline tests due to differences in shoe/cleat type or surface, use of ankle straps or braces, or the presence of another injury in the lower extremities. black triangle on the right Images are reserved for athletes in whom intracerebral hemorrhage is suspected. black triangle on the right There is no same-day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. black triangle on right Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for impaired physical or mental status. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING: black triangle on the right Neuropsychological testing (NP) is an objective measure of brain-behavior relationships and is more sensitive to subtle cognitive impairment than clinical examination. black triangle on the right Most concussions can be adequately managed without the use of NP testing. black triangle on the right Computerized neuropsychological tests (CNP) should be interpreted by trained healthcare professionals familiar with the type of test and the individual limitations of the test, including an informed assessment of reliable rate of change, baseline variability, and false positive and false negative rates. black triangle on the right Paper-and-pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains, and test for other conditions that may mask or complicate the assessment of a concussion. The right black triangle NP test should be used only as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation. black triangle on the right The ideal timing, frequency, and type of PN testing have not been determined. black triangle on the right In some cases, correctly administered and interpreted PN tests provide added value in assessing cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. black triangle on right It is unknown whether the use of NP testing in sports concussion management helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury, or long-term complications. black triangle at right Comprehensive PN evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or challenging courses. BACK TO SCHOOL – Black Triangle on the Right Students will require cognitive rest and may require academic accommodations such as a reduced workload and more time for tests while recovering from a concussion. RETURN TO PLAY: black triangle on the right Concussion symptoms must resolve before returning to exercise. black triangle on the right A progression of RTP involves a gradual, gradual increase in physical demands, sport-specific activities, and contact risk. black triangle on the right If symptoms occur with activity, progression should be stopped and restarted at the previous step without symptoms. right black triangle RTP after concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licensed health care provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: black triangle on the right The primary concern with early RTP is decreased reaction time leading to increased risk of repeated concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: Black triangle at right There is growing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. black triangle on the right Some studies have suggested an association between previous concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define the risk factors and cause of any long-term neurological impairment. DISQUALIFICATION FROM SPORT: black triangle on the right There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/removing an athlete from a sport after a concussion. Each case must be carefully deliberated and an individualized approach must be taken to determine disqualification. EDUCATION: Right Black Triangle Greater efforts are needed to educate stakeholders, including athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators, and health care providers to improve concussion recognition, management, and prevention. black triangle on the right Physicians should be prepared to advise on the potential long-term consequences of concussion and recurrent concussions. PREVENTION: black triangle to the right Primary prevention of some injuries may be possible with rule modification and enforcement and fair play. black triangle on the right Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding, laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of concussions black triangle to the right There is no current evidence that mouthguards can reduce the severity of concussions or prevent them. black triangle on the right Secondary prevention may be possible through proper management of RTP. LEGISLATION: Right Black Triangle Legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non-scholastic athletic organizations regarding the safety and management of concussions. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Black triangle on the right Additional research is needed to validate current screening tools, delineate the role of NP testing, and improve identification of those at risk for prolonged postconcussive symptoms or other long-term complications. black triangle on the right Evolving technologies for concussion diagnosis, such as new neuroimaging techniques or biological markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports concussion.",0,0,

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a comprehensive academic community-based intervention on quit rates in a population-based sample of smokers. METHODS: This community-based quasi-experimental study involved representative samples of 259 primary care physicians and 4295 adult smokers. A detailed academic intervention was delivered to clinicians in the intervention areas over a 15-month period. Analyzes of data from the 2346 subjects who reported at least one physician visit over 24 months were performed. Multivariable regression analyzes were performed to determine the impact of the intervention on self-reported smoking cessation rates, reported using adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Among smokers who reported a visit to the doctor during the study period, there was a borderline significant effect for those who resided in intervention areas versus control areas (OR = 1.35""; 95% CI .99-1.83; P = 0.057).Among a subgroup of 819 smokers who reported a visit with an enrolled physician, we observed a significant effect for those residing in the intervention areas (OR = 1.80; 95% CI: 1.16-2.75 ; P = 0.008) CONCLUSION: A detailed academic intervention to improve physician-provided smoking cessation counseling is an effective strategy for disseminating smoking cessation interventions to community practices.",0,0,
156,An administrative intervention to improve the use of laboratory tests within a university hospital,"BACKGROUND: Improving the adequacy of behavioral tests and reducing the number of laboratory tests have been recognized as essential parts of quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a short-term administrative educational intervention aimed at reducing the use of the clinical biochemistry laboratory. DESIGN: An analysis comparing the use of laboratory tests performed on hospitalized patients before and after the intervention. SETTING: Computerized database of all laboratory tests performed at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel during 1999-2003. INTERVENTION: Administrative intervention included restriction of available emergency laboratory tests and frequency of repeat orders. The educational measures included: discussion of the misuse of laboratory tests and its consequences with the medical staff of the hospital, and presentation of the new restrictive policy. Feedback of the results of the intervention was sent to the wards and reviewed with senior medical staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in utilization (measured as rates per 100 hospital days) of clinical chemistry tests by hospital division and by selected laboratory tests. RESULTS: An overall reduction of 19% in laboratory tests (95% CI: 18.8-19.2%) was observed one year after the intervention. Utilization decreased significantly in all medical areas of the hospital, ranging from 14.9 to 43.8%. During the intervention period, the use of hematology tests was reduced by 7.6% (P = 0.009). Statistically significant reductions were observed in the ordering of the 12 selected clinical biochemical tests. Although total cholesterol orders decreased by 72.2%, the use of 'high volume' tests, such as glucose and electrolytes, showed only a modest decrease (7.9% and 6.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present study included all hospital medical staff and covered all available clinical biochemistry tests. This fairly simple and low-cost intervention resulted in significant reductions in clinical chemistry testing orders, as well as hematology blood tests ordering.",0,1,
157,An evaluation of user acceptance and satisfaction with the automated clinical practice guideline for tobacco use cessation,"OBJECTIVE: To describe user acceptance and satisfaction with the Automated Clinical Practice Guideline (ACPG) for tobacco cessation (TUC) in the Henry Ford Health System. STUDY DESIGN: Previous research evaluated compliance with the 5 A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Help, Organize) of the TUC ACPG in 3 study arms. This article describes user satisfaction with the TUC ACPG after implementation. METHODS: In all arms of the study, providers completed a survey before participating in a focus group. RESULTS: All providers in the TUC arm indicated that they ""almost always"" asked their patients about tobacco use. Providers in the TUC arm were generally satisfied with the features of the TUC ACPG, particularly the ease of electronically referring a patient to the Tobacco Intervention Program. Barriers to use included time constraints, lack of staff, and the desire to ""opt out"" of the program for patients in specific situations (eg, terminally ill patients). CONCLUSION: As ACPGs are incorporated into electronic medical records, it is important to obtain information from the provider prior to implementation, provide technology that is easy to use and fits into clinic workflow, and give clinicians the autonomy to opt out of the guide. under specific clinical circumstances.",0,0,
158,An automated minimum retest interval reject rule reduces CRP repeat workload and expense and influences physician ordering behavior.,"Objectives Repeat serum C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements on the same day or on consecutive days are of limited clinical value. Minimum retest intervals are recommended to manage unnecessary retests. As not previously reported, we studied the effect of minimum retest interval test refusal on laboratory workload and expense and on physician requesting behavior. Methods In a prospective study, we evaluated the effect of an automated 48-h PCR minimum retest interval rule on inpatient and outpatient PCR workload and costs. Control data on urea workload and serum electrolytes (UE) were collected from inpatients and outpatients during the study. Results Over 1 year, there was a 7.0% and 12.3% decrease in CRP requests and CRP tests analyzed, respectively, after the introduction of the minimum reassessment interval rule compared to the period 1 year reference. This equated to an estimated annual reduction in revenue costs of £10,500, but a cash saving in consumable costs of £3,000. There were no significant changes in EU requests. Conclusions We report, for the first time, that automated minimum retest interval rejection rules as a stand-alone strategy are a cost-effective and sustainable method of reducing unnecessary repeat PCR testing, leading to small cash savings in the laboratory, more efficient use of laboratory resources and standardization. of patient care pathways. The minimum retest interval reject rule also altered the physician's test request behavior toward a more appropriate request.",0,1,
159,"An educational program influencing healthcare professionals to recommend exercise to their patients with type 2 diabetes: understanding the processes: a case study from Oxfordshire, UK","BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity levels decreases the risk of premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, eg, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke. Despite this, most adults in England do not meet the physical activity guidelines. Counseling and signaling of physical activity offered to patients at risk by primary care providers is recommended. However, exercise medicine education is sparse, leading to poor clinicians' knowledge of the evidence and risk-reduction strategies for implementing effective patient behavior change. The intervention 'Generation Games' seeks to increase physical activity in the population over 50 years of Oxfordshire. Offers a Health Professional Education Program (HPEP) that provides exercise medicine education and promotion of Generation Games that health professionals can point patients to. There is a poor evidence base on how such education translates into a change in patient exercise behaviour. METHODS: The research aimed to create a greater understanding of how an educational program can influence health professionals to recommend Generation Games and increase exercise behavior in patients with type 2 diabetes. A case study method facilitated the examination of routines and cultures studied: the diabetes nurses' experience was used as an example of best practice engagement with the HPEP. Observation, interviews and documentation were used to triangulate the data. Data analysis refined and developed themes within key theoretical frameworks. RESULTS: First, there is a lack of knowledge about the risk-reducing benefits of physical activity and a belief that efforts to motivate patients to increase their physical activity are ineffective, creating barriers to engagement. with the HPEP. Second, practice nurses tasked with providing lifestyle advice to patients with diabetes, who also suffer from a deficit in motivational interviewing skills, find entrenched physical activity behaviors extremely challenging and therefore , highly value the HPEP for providing useful tools. Third, patients who hear about generation games from a health professional may have different expectations of how it can change their exercise behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise medicine education has the potential to improve patient care and services. Before initiatives like HPEP can be successful, primary care practice requires a more supportive culture of exercise medicine. Counseling, training, encouragement and follow-up services focused on patient behavior change also need to be adequately resourced.",0,0,
160,An educational approach to improve outcomes in acute renal failure (ARF): report of a quality improvement project,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a quality improvement project that used a multifaceted educational intervention on how to improve clinicians' knowledge, confidence, and awareness of acute kidney injury (AKI). SETTING: 2 large acute care university hospitals in England, serving a combined population of over 1.5 million people. PARTICIPANTS: All secondary care physicians working in clinical areas were selected, with a specific focus on physicians working in acute admission areas. INTERVENTIONS: A multifaceted educational intervention consisting of traditional didactic lectures, small group case-based teaching, and an interactive web-based learning resource. OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed clinicians' knowledge of AKI and their self-reported clinical behavior using an interactive questionnaire before and after the educational intervention. Secondary outcome measures included clinical audit of patients' notes before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of clinicians reported knowledge of local AKI patterns in the preintervention questionnaire compared to 64% in the follow-up questionnaire (chi&sup2""=60.2, p<0.001). improvement in the number of physicians reporting satisfactory practice in diagnosing AKI, 50% vs 68% (chi&sup;=12.1, p<0.001) and investigating patients with AKI, 48% vs 64% (chi&sup2;=9.5, p=0.002). Those responsible for clinical audits showed a trend towards better clinical practice.CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement project using a multifaceted educational intervention improved awareness of AKI, as evidenced by changes in self-reported management of patients with AKI. Physician LRA Elements of the project have been sustained beyond the project period and demonstrate the power of quality improvement projects to help initiate practice change Our findings are limited by fac confounders and highlight the need for formal randomized studies to determine the impact of educational initiatives in the clinical setting.",0,0,
161,An educational intervention reduces the rate of inappropriate echocardiograms in a hospitalization medical service,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to prospectively study the impact of an educational intervention based on appropriate use criteria (AUC) on the request for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) among house staff in the general internal medicine service for patients hospitalized in a center academic doctor. BACKGROUND: AUCs for TTE were developed in response to concerns about the inappropriate use of TTE. To date, educational interventions based on AUC to reduce inappropriate use of TTE have not been studied prospectively. METHODS: A prospective time series analysis of an educational intervention was performed and then compared with orders for TTE in the same medical service during a control period. The intervention consisted of: 1) a lecture for house staff on the 2011 AUC for TTE""; 2) a pocket card applying the AUC to common clinical scenarios""; and 3) biweekly email feedback regarding ordering behavior. TTE orders were tracked daily during the intervention period, and feedback reports were emailed at 2-week intervals. The primary outcome was the proportion of inappropriate and appropriate TTEs ordered during the intervention period. RESULTS: Of all TTEs ordered in the control and study periods, 99% and 98%, respectively, were classifiable using the 2011 AUC. During the study period, there was a 26% reduction in the number of TTEs requested per day compared to the number requested during the control period (2.9 vs. 3.9 TTE, p < 0.001). During the study period, the proportion of inappropriate ETT was significantly lower (5% vs. 13%, p < 0.001) and the proportion of appropriate ETT was significantly higher (93% vs. 84%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A simple educational intervention produced a significant reduction in the proportion of inappropriate ETTs and increased the proportion of appropriate ETTs ordered in an inpatient academic medical service. This study provides a practical approach to using AUC to reduce the number of inappropriate TTEs. Further study in other practice settings is warranted.",0,0,
162,An Efficacy Trial of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in a Representative Sample of Outpatients with Psychosis,"OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapies for psychosis (CBTp) has been sufficiently established for inclusion in some national treatment guidelines. However, treatment efficacy does not guarantee effectiveness in routine practice, where clinician experience and patient mix may be different. Therefore, we assess the applicability, acceptability, and effectiveness of CBT when routinely offered in a public mental health service. DESIGN: A prospectively recruited representative sample (N = 94) of patients with psychotic disorders from a geographic catchment area in Melbourne, Australia, were randomized to CBTp or treatment as usual. METHOD: The CBTp intervention included components of psychoeducation, positive symptoms, and comorbid problems. Therapists collaboratively negotiated goals with patients and used treatment components from a manual. Intention-to-treat analyzes used data at baseline, 9 months, and 18 months. RESULTS: Measures of working alliance and client satisfaction indicated excellent acceptability. Both groups improved to a similar degree on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, with no advantage for the CBTp group. The most frequently implemented components of CBTp were comorbid disorders/personal problems and ""personalized psychoeducation""; working with persistent symptoms was the main focus in relatively few sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of benefit for the CBTp group may be due to : the infrequent focus on positive symptoms (the most replicated outcome domain for CBTp); the unselected nature of patients (rather than those with distressing symptoms or referred by physicians);"" or, to the insufficient experience of the therapist.",0,0,
163,An electronic health record-based intervention to improve tobacco dependence treatment in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background To improve documentation and treatment of tobacco dependence in primary care, we developed and implemented an enhanced 3-part electronic medical record: (1) smoking status icons, (2) tobacco dependence treatment reminders, and (3) a smart tobacco form that made it easy to order medication and counseling referrals by fax and email. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of improvement in 26 primary care practices between December 19, 2006, and September 30, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of documented smokers who contacted a counselor for give up smoking. Secondary outcomes included documentation of coded smoking status and medication prescription. Results During the 9-month study period, 132,630 patients made 315,962 visits to study practices. Coded documentation of smoking increased from 37% of patients to 54% (+17%) in intervention practices and from 35% of patients to 46% (+11%) in control practices (p < 0.001 for the difference in differences). Among the 9,589 patients who were documented smokers at the start of the study, more patients in the intervention practices were recorded as non-smokers at the end of the study (5.3% vs. 1.9% in the control practices""; P < 0.001 Among 12,207 documented smokers, more patients in intervention practices contacted a smoking cessation counselor (3.9% vs. 0.3% in control practices; P < .001). % in control practices, p = 0.40.) Conclusion This electronic health record-based intervention improved documentation of smoking and increased smoking counseling attendance, but not prescription of smoking cessation medications.",0,1,
164,An electronic medical record-based intervention to improve quality of care for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and atypical presentations of GERD.,"Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in primary care, but is often underdiagnosed and untreated. GERD can also present with atypical symptoms such as chronic cough and asthma, and doctors may not be aware of this presentation. Our aim was to implement and evaluate an intervention to improve the diagnosis and treatment of GERD and atypical GERD in primary care. Method This was a randomized controlled trial in primary care office practice using a US national network of practices (Medical Quality Improvement Consortium - MQIC) that share the same electronic medical record (EMR). Thirteen practices with 53 providers were randomly assigned to the EMR-based prompting and education intervention, and 14 practices with 66 providers were randomly assigned to the control group with a total of more than 67,000 patients and examining GERD diagnostic outcomes and the proper treatment. Results Among patients who did not have GERD at baseline, new GERD diagnoses were significantly increased in the intervention group (3.1%) versus the control group (2.3%) (P<0.01). This remained significant after controlling for clustering with a diagnostic probability of 1.33 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.56) for the intervention group. For patients with atypical symptoms, those in the intervention group were more likely to receive a GERD diagnosis (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.88) and to receive GERD treatment (OR 1 .40, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.88). 1.83) than those in the control group. Conclusions The diagnosis and treatment of GERD in primary care, particularly among patients with atypical symptoms, can be improved by using an EMR-based tool that incorporates decision support and education. However, there is significant room for improvement in using the right treatment.",1,1,
165,An evaluation of opioid prescription for chronic non-malignant pain by Australian general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the quality of the prescription of opioid analgesia in chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) by general practitioners (general practitioners, family physicians). DESIGN: An anonymous questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The setting was five Australian general practice divisions (geographically based GP associations). METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all members of the division. Outcome measures were compliance with the individual recommendations of the locally derived CNMP practice guidelines. RESULTS: We received 404 responses (23.3% response rate). In the previous fortnight, clinicians prescribed long-term continuous opioids for CNMP for a median of 4 and a mean of 7.1 (+/-8.7) CNMP patients. Guideline agreement (GLC) was poor, as no GP consistently adhered to all guideline items, and only 31% of GPs typically use most items. The GLC was higher to avoid high dose or fast acting formulations. It was lower for strategies that minimize harm to public and individual health, such as starting opioids in a time-limited trial, using contracts, and excluding or managing aberrant behaviors. GLC was positively associated with relevant training or qualifications, registration with the Australian Prescription Drug Monitoring Programme, being an opioid substitution therapy prescriber, and female gender. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, long-term opioids were frequently started for CNMP without a quality medication use approach. Potential sequelae include inadequate pain management and increased opioid-related harm. These data suggest the need for improved resources and training in the management of opioids in pain and addictions.",0,0,
166,An Evidence-Based Guide to Writing Clinical Research Grant Proposals,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially compared to provincial facilities. She buttressed this claim with statistics published in the William Fair Registrar General's report, which stated that 24 London hospitals had mortality rates above 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr had calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died throughout the year by the number of patients hospitalized in a single day. When calculated as the annual number of deaths divided by the total number of patients hospitalized during the year, the mortality rate for London hospitals was 10%. A raucous debate broke out in the London medical press over the best way to calculate hospital mortality rates. Critics claimed that Farr had not adjusted for differences in disease severity between urban and rural hospitals and that his figures would mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale, in turn, criticized the poor quality of the hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics intended to compare the quality of providers.",0,0,
167,An evolving perspective on physical activity counseling by medical professionals,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and a leading cause of premature mortality. An increasing proportion of adults worldwide do not engage in sufficient physical activity to prevent or alleviate these adverse effects. Medical professionals have been identified as potentially powerful sources of influence for those who do not meet minimum physical activity guidelines. Health professionals are respected and expected sources of advice and reach a significant and relevant proportion of the population. Despite this potential, physical activity promotion is not routinely practiced by health professionals. DISCUSSION: Medical professionals face several known barriers to promoting physical activity, including lack of time and lack of perceived efficacy in changing physical activity behavior in patients. Furthermore, the evidence on the effective promotion of physical activity by medical professionals is inconclusive. To address these issues, new approaches to physical activity promotion are being proposed. These include collaborating with community physical activity behavior change interventions, preparing patients for effective brief counseling during a consultation with the medical professional, and the use of interactive behavior change technology. SUMMARY: It is important that we recognize the latent risk of physical inactivity among patients presenting in clinical settings. Preparation to improve the patient's physical activity behaviors should begin before the consultation and may include screening for physical activity. Medical professionals should also identify appropriate community interventions to which they can refer physically inactive patients. Outsourcing most of a comprehensive physical activity intervention to community-based interventions will reduce the clinical consultation time needed to address the problem with each patient. Priorities for future research include investigating ways to promote successful referrals and subsequent participation in comprehensive community support programs to increase physical activity levels of inactive patients. In addition, future clinical trials of physical activity interventions need to be evaluated in the context of a broader results framework to inform a systematic consideration of overall strengths and weaknesses with respect to not only efficacy but also cost-effectiveness and the likelihood of translating successful interventions to clinical settings.",0,0,
168,An experimental study of the determinants of group judgments in the development of clinical guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines to improve quality of care are a familiar part of clinical practice. Formal consensus methods, such as the nominal group technique, are often used as part of guideline development, but little is known about the factors that affect the statements produced by nominal groups and their consistency with evidence from the literature. research. METHODS: Cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy, and antidepressants for irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic back pain were selected for the study. 16 nominal groups in a factorial design allowed comparison of GPs alone with mixed groups of GPs and specialists, provision of a literature review without provision, and ratings made in the context of realistic or ideal levels of care resources medical. Participants rated suitability independently and again after a facilitated meeting. Audio tapes of four group discussions were analyzed. FINDINGS: There was agreement with the research evidence for 51% of 192 settings. Agreement was more likely if the group was GP only, if a literature review was provided, or if the evidence was in agreement with clinicians' beliefs. Assumptions about the level of available resources had no impact. Clinical and social cues had mixed effects, regardless of research evidence. Qualitative analysis showed the modifying effect of clinical experience and beliefs on research evidence. INTERPRETATION: Guidelines cannot be based on data alone"";"" judgment is unavoidable. The nominal group technique is a method for obtaining and aggregating judgments in a transparent and structured way. It can provide important information about levels of agreement among experts.

170,An experimental study of the determinants of the degree of disagreement within clinical guideline development groups,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the degree of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design with 16 groups made up of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups rated the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed in three design features: provision of a systematic review of the literature (versus not provided), group composition (mixed versus general practitioner only), and assumptions about available healthcare resources (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation of a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the degree of disagreement within groups (all p>0.3). Disagreement differed between treatments (tighter consensus for cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and signals (tighter consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment ). CONCLUSION: In terms of the degree of disagreement in the groups in this study, the development of a formal consensus was a sound technique in that the results did not depend on how it was carried out.",0,0,

173,An integrative review exploring decision-making factors that influence mental health nurses' use of restraint,"UNLABELED: WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: There is emerging evidence that highlights the counter-therapeutic impact of the use of restraint and promotes the minimization of this practice in mental health care. Mental health nurses are often the professional group that uses restraint and understanding the factors that influence their decision making becomes critical. To date, there are no other published articles that have conducted a similar broad search to review this topic. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eight emerging themes are identified as factors influencing mental health nurses' decision-making in the use of restraint. The topics are: 'safety for all', 'restraint as a necessary intervention', 'restraint as a last resort', 'role conflict', 'maintaining control', 'staff composition', 'knowledge and perception of behaviors of patients', and the 'psychological impact'. The 'last resort' seems to be the mantra of acceptable use of containment, although, to date, there are no studies that specifically consider what this concept really is. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: These findings should be taken into account in evaluating the use of restraint in mental health settings and appropriate strategies implemented to support the shift towards minimization of restraint. As the concept of 'last resort' is mentioned in many policies and guidelines internationally without a published understanding of what this means, research should prioritize it as the critical next step in restraint minimization efforts. INTRODUCTION: While mechanical and manual restraint as an institutional method of control within mental health settings may seem necessary at times, there is emerging literature that highlights the potential counter-therapeutic impact of this practice for patients and staff. Nurses are the professional group most likely to use mechanical and manual restraint methods in mental health settings. Therefore, in-depth knowledge is warranted to understand what factors influence nurses' decision-making regarding the use of restraint. OBJECTIVE: To explore what influences the decision-making of mental health nurses in the use of restraint. METHOD: An integrative review was conducted using the Cooper framework. RESULTS: Eight emerging themes were identified: 'safety for all', 'restraint as a necessary intervention', 'restraint as a last resort', 'role conflict', 'maintaining control', 'staff composition', 'knowledge and perception of patient behaviors' and the 'psychological impact'. These topics highlight how mental health nurses' decision-making is influenced by ethical and safety responsibilities, as well as interpersonal and staff-related factors. CONCLUSION: Research is needed to better understand ""last resort"" experience and updating in the use of restraint and to provide strategies to prevent the use of restraint in mental health settings.",0,0,

176,"An ongoing struggle: a mixed-methods systematic review of interventions, barriers, and facilitators to achieving optimal self-management by children and youth with type 1 diabetes in educational settings.","BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes most commonly occurs in younger children who are often of preschool age and enter the education system with diabetes-related support needs that evolve over time. It is important that children are supported to optimally manage their diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin regimen at school. Young people manage themselves at school/university. METHOD: Theory-based mixed-methods systematic review to determine intervention efficacy and synthesize views of children, parents, and professionals on barriers and facilitators to achieving optimal diabetes self-care and control for children and youth aged 3 to 25 years of age in educational settings. RESULTS: Eleven intervention and 55 view studies were included. Meta-analysis was not possible. The study foci largely coincided with school guidance on diabetes. Intervention studies were limited to specific settings with a high risk of bias for the most part. Opinion studies were mostly of moderate quality with common transferable findings. Health plans and support from school nurses (various types) were effective. Telemedicine at school was effective for individual case management. Most educational interventions to increase the knowledge and confidence of children or school staff had significant short-term effects, but longer follow-up is required. Children, parents, and staff said they struggled with many common structural, organizational, educational, and attitudinal barriers to school. In general, aspects of school guidance (for example, individual health plans) had not been implemented. The children recognized and appreciated the school staff who were trained and trusted to support diabetes management. Research with university students was lacking. Supporting college students on campus significantly improved diabetes knowledge, attitudes, and self-management. Self-management was easier for students who combined diabetes management with the student's lifestyle, such as adopting strategies to control alcohol use. CONCLUSION: This new mixed-method systematic review is the first to integrate intervention effectiveness with child/parent/professional views mapped against school diabetes guidelines. Diabetes management could be improved overall by fully implementing and auditing the impact of the guideline. The evidence is limited in quality and there are gaps in our knowledge of what works. Telemedicine between health care providers and schools, and school nurse support for children is effective in specific contexts, but not all education systems employ on-site nurses. More innovative and sustainable solutions and robust evaluations are required. Comprehensive lifestyle approaches for college students deserve further development and evaluation.",0,0,
177,An update on the management of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes,"More than 780,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) each year. As physicians, it is our responsibility to provide timely diagnosis, treatment, and management of these patients. After identifying the patient with ACS and confirming that there is no ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction requiring immediate revascularization, clinicians should perform a diagnostic workup for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). It is important to understand the latest best practice guidelines in the treatment and management of NSTEACS patients who have high in-hospital mortality rates. Physicians must integrate the medical history and examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory findings to correctly diagnose NSTEACS. Early treatment with guideline-directed medical therapy is imperative even in the setting of an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention. The focus of this review is to discuss appropriate strategies for the evaluation and management of patients with NSTEACS according to the most recent ACC/AHA practice guidelines.",0,0,
178,Anesthetics and other shock treatments: World War I and beyond,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major health risk factor for military personnel deployed in modern warfare. In World War I this condition (then known as shell shock or 'neurasthenia') was such a problem that French doctors started 'advanced psychiatry' in 1915. Some British doctors tried general anesthesia as a treatment (ether and chloroform ), while others preferred the application of electricity. In 1917 four British 'advanced psychiatric units' were established. Hospitals for shell-shocked soldiers were also established in Britain, including (for officers) the Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh"";"" patients diagnosed with more serious psychiatric conditions were transferred to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. Towards the end of 1918, the anesthetic and electrical treatments of shell shock were gradually displaced by modified Freudian methods of psychodynamic intervention. The efficacy of 'advanced psychiatry' was controversial. In 1922, the War Office produced a report on war shock with recommendations for the prevention of shell shock. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, this seemed to have been ignored. The term ""combat fatigue"" was introduced when failure rates became alarming, and then the value of preselection was recognized. At Maudsley Hospital in London in 1940, barbiturate abreaction was advocated for rapid relief of severe anxiety and hysteria, using intravenous anesthetics: Somnifaine, paraldehyde, Amytal sodium. 'Pentothal narcosis' and 'narcoanalysis' were adopted by British and American military psychiatrists. However, by 1945, medical thinking gradually settled on the same approaches that seemed effective in 1918. The term PTSD was introduced in 1980. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for management (NICE) (2005) recommend Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and consideration of antidepressants.",0,0,

Cross references and personal files were manually searched. Studies reporting original data or review articles related to these topics were appraised and critically appraised by experts for each topic area. Data on population demographics, study characteristics, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes were systematically abstracted and synthesized and refined by group members. The data synthesis and results were reviewed by a panel of independent experts and presented to a broader audience, including clinicians, scientists, regulatory staff and industry representatives at the Newborn Drug Development Initiative workshop. The recommendations were revised after extensive discussions at the workshop and among committee members. RESULTS: The design of clinical trials to investigate novel or currently available approaches to analgesia and anesthesia in neonates requires consideration of salient study designs and ethical issues. Conditions requiring treatment include pain/stress resulting from invasive procedures, surgical operations, inflammatory conditions, and routine neonatal intensive care. Study design considerations should define inclusion and exclusion criteria, a rationale for stratification, confounding effects of comorbid conditions, and other clinical factors. Significant ethical issues include the limitations of studying infants, obtaining informed consent, conducting benefit-risk assessments, defining compensation or rewards for participation, safety considerations, the use of placebo controls, and variability between meetings. of institutional review in the interpretation of federal guidelines on research involving human subjects. . For optimal study design, investigators must formulate well-defined study questions, choose appropriate trial designs, estimate drug efficacy, calculate sample size, determine study duration, identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and avoid drug interactions. Specific outcome measures may include scores on pain assessment scales, various biomarkers and their response patterns, process outcomes (eg, length of hospital stay, time to extubation), intermediate or long-term outcomes, and security parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Much more research is needed in this field to formulate a scientifically sound, evidence-based, and clinically useful framework for the management of anesthesia and analgesia in neonates. Newer study designs and additional ethical dilemmas may be defined by the accumulation of data in this field.",0,0,
180,Analysis of information submitted by sponsors of clinical trials regarding the safety of investigational drugs,"During the conduct of clinical trials in medical institutions, trial sponsors submit information on the safety of investigational drugs in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. In the present study, clinical trial reports conducted at Tokyo University Hospital were examined, focusing on the safety information provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Clinical trial sponsors submitted 202 reports (52 protocols) of safety information to the IRB between April 2000 and March 2001, of which 185 contained a total of 3,021 cases of adverse events. Of these, 194 reports were deemed not associated with any significant problems by clinical/medical investigators and the trials were continued. For 157 of those 194 reports, informing test subjects of report content, including adverse events, was deemed unnecessary. The decision whether or not test subjects should be informed of such content tends to depend on the causal relationship between the adverse events and drug intake, as well as the predictability of the adverse events. For 8 of those 194 reports, the IRB recommended that clinical investigators/physicians provide information to test subjects and/or submit detailed information on the status of these subjects to the IRB. From these results, we suggest that it is necessary to establish a system to unify and evaluate drug safety information to provide safe and efficient clinical trials.",0,0,
181,Palm Angina: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Palm PDA Software for Referrals for Cardiac Testing.,"OBJECTIVE Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are popular with physicians: in 2003, 33% of Canadian physicians reported using them in their practices. We do not know, however, whether the use of a PDA changes the behavior of practicing physicians. We studied the efficacy of a PDA software application in helping family physicians diagnose angina among patients with chest pain. DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled pilot trial using a cluster design. SETTING Primary care practices in the Toronto area. PARTICIPANTS Eighteen family physicians belonging to the North Toronto Primary Care Research Network (Nortren) or recruited from a local hospital. INTERVENTIONS We randomized clinicians to receive a Palm PDA (which included angina diagnostic software) or continue with conventional care. Physicians prospectively recorded the care process of patients aged 30 to 75 years with suspected angina, for 7 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Was the process of caring for patients with suspected angina improved when their doctors had PDAs and software? The primary outcomes we analyzed were the frequency of cardiac stress test requests for suspected angina and the adequacy of referral for cardiac stress testing at presentation and for nuclear cardiology testing after cardiac stress testing. The secondary outcome was referral to cardiologists. RESULTS The software led to greater overall use of cardiac stress tests (81% vs. 50%). The absolute increase was 31% (p = 0.007, 95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 58%). There was a trend toward more appropriate use of exercise testing (48.6% PDA vs. 28.6% control), an increase of 20% (p=0.284, 95% CI: -11.54% at 51.4%). There was also a trend toward more appropriate use of nuclear cardiology after cardiac stress testing (63.0% vs. 45.5%), an absolute increase of 17.5% (P=0.400, 95% CI : -13.9% to 48.9%). Referrals to cardiologists did not increase (38.2% with PDA vs 40.9%, p = 0.869). CONCLUSION A PDA-based software application can improve the care of patients with suspected angina seen in family practices"";"" this finding requires confirmation in a larger study.",0,1,

183,Antibiotic prescription in long-term care facilities: a multidisciplinary qualitative investigation,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the opinions of health professionals on the prescription of antibiotics in long-term care facilities (LTCF). Use the findings to recommend intervention strategies for antimicrobial stewardship in LTCF. DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed by thematic content analysis. After the interviews, the emerging findings were mapped into the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and the behavior change wheel and behavior change technique (BCT) taxonomy were used to recommend future intervention strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted with 37 health professionals working in LTCF (10 general practitioners, 4 consultants, 14 nurses, 9 pharmacists) between December 2012 and March 2013. SETTING: Interviews were conducted in the Cork metropolitan region . RESULTS: The main TDF domains that emerged were: 'Knowledge', 'Environmental context and resources', 'Social influences', 'Beliefs about consequences', 'Memory, attention and decision making', and the findings identified a need of 'Behavior regulation'. Many participants believed that antibiotic prescribing was satisfactory in their LTCF, despite a lack of surveillance activities. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using the TDF and BCT taxonomy, found that antibiotic prescription in LTCF is influenced by many social and contextual factors. Patient population and setting challenges, belief in patient consequences, and lack of guideline implementation and knowledge about antibiotic prescribing patterns are important challenges that need to be addressed. Based on the study findings and the application of the TDF and BCT taxonomy, we suggest some practical intervention roles for antimicrobial stewardship in LTCF.",0,0,
184,antibiotic resistance,Antibiotic resistance is economically and physiologically costly. Control of antibiotic resistance will require the aggressive implementation of numerous strategies. Ongoing vigilance is needed to monitor the known classes of antibiotics and to be able to identify the development of other potential types. Early intervention is needed to combat the rising rate of resistance. The persistent use of hygiene measures and the controlled use of antibiotics will limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. Health care providers should monitor compliance with control measures. Environmental and hand control measures continue to be a critical component of staff education activities. Active management of infections with non-pharmacological treatments should be promoted. Motivational campaigns will reinforce positive infection control behaviors. Constant monitoring of antibiotic use will help meet CDC guidance to combat antibiotic resistance and keep the population healthy.,0,0,

186,"Prescription patterns of antimalarials in government hospitals and selected parastatal hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria","BACKGROUND: Malaria is a curable and preventable disease and is a major public health problem in Nigeria. Chloroquine was the first-line drug in its treatment in Nigeria until recently, where artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are being promoted. Inappropriate prescribing, that is, not prescribing drugs according to evidence-based guidelines to ensure safe, effective, and economical use, is irrational drug use behavior. Greater benefits of chloroquine or a slowing of progression to resistance could be achieved by improving prescribing practice, drug quality, and patient compliance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of prescription of antimalarials and to evaluate the rational prescription of chloroquine by prescribers in government and parastatal hospitals in the state of Lagos. METHODS: The study was carried out in the ten government general hospitals under the Lagos State Hospital Management Board (now Lagos State Health Service Commission), a parastatal hospital, and an oil company clinic, using patient prescriptions. One hundred prescriptions for adults and children were systematically sampled for each month over a one-year period (January to December 2000). When there were fewer than 100 prescriptions in a month, all available prescriptions were sampled for analysis. RESULTS: The average number of medications per consultation in all hospitals was 4.259 +/- 0.009. The average number of injections per encounter was 1.215 +/- 0.009. About 48.5% of all prescriptions had at least one injection, while 40.9% of prescriptions had dipyrone injection. The average cost of medications per encounter was N 147.40 +/- 0.765. The percentage of encounters with chloroquine was 82.5% followed by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 14.2%. The percentage of prescriptions with the correct dose of chloroquine was 47.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy exists in all hospitals. The average number of medications per visit for most hospitals was greater than 4. Less than half of the prescriptions had the correct dose of chloroquine. This study can serve as a baseline for intervention on irrational prescription.",0,0,
187,Antioxidant vitamin supplements in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases,"Oxidative stress, in particular the oxidative modification of LDL cholesterol, appears to be of great importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Several observational epidemiological studies have suggested that intake of antioxidant vitamins is associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, experimental animal studies have shown that antioxidant vitamins slow the progression of atherosclerosis. However, prospective controlled clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the use of antioxidants and vitamin supplements cannot be recommended as a preventive or therapeutic intervention.",0,0,

189,Antipsychotic polypharmacy in schizophrenia: benefits and risks,"Antipsychotic polypharmacy refers to the co-prescription of more than one antipsychotic drug for an individual patient. Prescription surveys in psychiatric services internationally have identified relatively frequent and consistent use of combination antipsychotics, usually for people with established schizophrenia, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some clinical settings. A common reason for prescribing more than one antipsychotic is to obtain a greater or more rapid therapeutic response than has been achieved with antipsychotic monotherapy. However, the evidence on the risks and benefits of such a strategy is equivocal and is generally not considered adequate to justify a recommendation for its use in routine clinical practice in psychiatry. Combination antipsychotics make an important contribution to high-dose prescribing, are associated with a greater burden of adverse effects, and are of limited value in helping to establish the optimal maintenance regimen for a patient. The relatively widespread use of antipsychotic polypharmacy identified in cross-sectional surveys reflects not only the addition of a second antipsychotic to increase therapeutic response, but also the use of antipsychotic medication as needed (primarily to treat disturbed behavior), gradual cross-titration while switching from one antipsychotic to another, and clozapine boosting with a second antipsychotic when the disease has not responded adequately to an optimized trial of clozapine. This review addresses clinical trial data and other evidence for each of these pharmacological approaches. Examples of systematic practice-based interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy, most of which have had modest success, are also reviewed. In general, the guidelines agree that if combination antipsychotics are prescribed to treat refractory psychotic illness, this should be done after other evidence-based pharmacological treatments, such as clozapine, have been exhausted. In addition, its prescription for each patient must be in the context of an individual trial, with monitoring of clinical response and adverse effects, and adequate monitoring of physical health.",0,0,
190,Application of a hospital audit to the use of nebulizers: the Case of the Hotel-Dieu de France-Lebanon,"PROBLEM: The aim of the study was to reduce unwarranted prescriptions for nebulized therapy, to meet international guidelines and reduce healthcare costs. METHODS: DESIGN: We conducted a prospective controlled study to assess the impact of local guidelines aimed at improving physician behavior on the appropriateness and costs of implementation. BACKGROUND AND SETTING: All departments of a university hospital: medical and surgical wards, intensive care units, emergency rooms, and overnight units. KEY MEASURE FOR CHANGE: Reduction in the number of inappropriate prescriptions for nebulized therapy. STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Implementation included two educational presentations, posters displayed in all departments, emails sent to all physicians and residents, and prescription re-evaluation one week later. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the rate of inappropriate prescriptions was 11.9% (42/358 of the patients treated with nebulizers had no indication for this treatment and 3/19 of the patients had an indication for nebulization but were not treated) ”; "" at post-intervention, the rate of inappropriate prescriptions was 14.6% (15.7% of patients with no indication for treatment, but no patients with an indication for treatment not treated), reflecting a lack of significant impact of the intervention CONCLUSIONS: The simple presentation of clinical guidelines did not lead to a change in medical practices.Another approach is needed to improve this result effectively.",0,0,
191,Application of the MAT-CHDSP to evaluate adherence to the guideline and achievement of the therapeutic goal in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention,"PURPOSE: Numerous studies have documented suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD(SP)). Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are continuously developed to define appropriate patient care, with the aim of reducing the risk of morbidity and death. The Medication Assessment Tool for CHD(SP) (MAT-CHD(SP)) was developed to assess adherence to CPGs on drug therapy and follow-up of patients with CHD(SP). The aim of this study was to explore whether the MAT-CHD(SP) could be applied retrospectively to assess adherence to guidelines and achievement of therapeutic goals in the secondary prevention of CHD. METHODS: We collected data from electronic medical records of all patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation from January to March 2008 (n = 300) and applied the MAT-CHD(SP). We measured the time for data collection and MAT application and tested reproducibility by calculating Cohen's kappa (kappa) value for inter- and intra-observer agreement. RESULTS: A total of 247 MAT applications were analyzed, showing an overall applicability of 66% of the 4446 MAT-CHD(SP) criteria and a high reproducibility of the MAT-CHD(SP) application (kappa values of 0, 93 and 0.95 for intraobserver and interobserver). agreement, respectively). The mean time for data collection and application of MAT-CHD(SP) was 11 min. Adherence to prescription criteria was high (>75%), but compliance with cholesterol and blood pressure therapeutic goals was low (<50%). Documentation of lifestyle advice achieved intermediate (50-75%) or low adherence, as did therapy modifications in patients who did not achieve therapy goals on hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: The MAT-CHD(SP) offers a means to identify both adherence and non-adherence to CHD(SP)-related CPGs, is applicable in the retrospective evaluation of CHD(SP), and identifies potentials to improve CHD(SP). patient care.",0,0,
192,Application of theory to improve audit and feedback interventions to increase acceptance of evidence-based transfusion practice: an intervention development protocol,"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion audits show that about 20% of transfusions fall outside national recommendations and guidelines. Audit and feedback is a widely used quality improvement intervention, but effects in clinical practice are variable, suggesting potential for improvement. Behavior theory, behavior change frameworks, and behavior change techniques provide systematic processes for improving intervention. This study is part of a larger program of work to promote acceptance of evidence-based transfusion practice. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to design two theoretically improved audit and feedback interventions"";"" one focused on content and one on delivery, and investigate feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: Study A (Content): A coding framework based on current evidence regarding audit and feedback, and behavior change theory and frameworks will be developed and applied as part of a structured content analysis to specify the key components of existing feedback documents. Prototype content-enhanced feedback documents will be developed, as well as a protocol outlining principles for improving feedback content. Study B (Delivery): Individual semi-structured interviews with health professionals and observations of team meetings in four hospitals will be used to specify and identify views on current audit and feedback practice. Interviews will be based on a topic guide developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Analysis of transcripts based on these frameworks will form the evidence base for developing a protocol describing an enhanced intervention that focuses on feedback delivery. Study C (Feasibility and Acceptability): The improved interventions will be tested in four hospitals. Semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and observations will be used to assess feasibility and acceptability. DISCUSSION: This intervention development paper reflects the UK Medical Research Council's guidance on the development of complex interventions, which emphasizes the importance of a sound theoretical basis for intervention design and recommends a systematic assessment of feasibility and acceptability. before taking the interventions to a large-scale evaluation. randomized study. The work includes specification of current practice so that, in trials later in this programme, there will be a clear distinction between control conditions (usual practice) and interventions to be tested.",0,0,
193,Applying Choice Architecture Principles to Understanding HIV Testing: Results from Malawi and Zimbabwe,"World Health Organization-led improvements in antenatal HIV counseling in sub-Saharan Africa between 2004 and 2011 have seen a parallel increase in HIV testing. We sought to determine the extent to which the use of choice architecture principles (one that introduces an opt-out as a default option) affects HIV testing uptake, beyond individual-level attitudes and cognitions. We analyzed Demographic and Health Survey data collected between 2004 and 2011 in Zimbabwe (N = 1,330) and Malawi (N = 4,043), countries where more than 10% of adults have HIV. We explored the influence of demographic variables, ways of knowing about HIV, stigma against people living with HIV, attitudes about spousal abuse, and whether or not HIV testing had been offered during antenatal visits. The results demonstrated that, taking into account secular trends in higher testing rates, structural-level support was the strongest predictor of HIV testing above and beyond individual-level attitudes and cognitions.

194,Approaches based on behavioral economics could help push patients and providers towards lower health spending growth,"Policies that change the environment or context in which decisions are made and ""push"" people toward particular choices have been relatively ignored in health care. This article examines the role that behavioral economics-based approaches could play in ""nudgeting"" providers and patients in ways that could slow the growth of health care spending. The basic idea of behavioral economics is that behavior is guided by the very fallible human brain and highly influenced by the environment or context in which decisions are made. In policy areas such as pensions and personal savings, approaches based on behavioral economics have provided remarkable results. In health care, such approaches have been used successfully but to a limited extent, such as the use of surgical checklists that have increased patient safety and reduced costs. With health care spending rising at unsustainable rates, we review the role behavioral economics-based approaches could play in offering policymakers a potential set of new tools to curb spending growth.",0,1,
195,Architectural frameworks: defining the structures to implement learning health systems,"Background The vision of transforming health systems into learning health systems (LHS) that rapidly and continuously transform knowledge into better health outcomes at lower cost is generating increased interest from government agencies, health organizations, and communities of health research. While existing initiatives demonstrate that different approaches can be successful in making the LHS vision a reality, they are too varied in purpose, focus, and scale to be replicated without undue effort. In fact, the necessary structures to effectively design and implement LHS on a larger scale are lacking. In this article, we propose the use of architectural frameworks to develop LHS that adhere to a recognized vision while adapting to your specific organizational context. Architectural frameworks are high-level descriptions of an organization as a system"";"" they capture the structure of its main components at various levels, the interrelationships between these components, and the principles that guide their evolution. Because these frameworks support the analysis of LHS and allow its outcomes to be simulated, they act as pre-implementation decision support tools that identify potential barriers and enablers to system development. Therefore, the chances of a successful deployment of the LHS are increased. Discussion We present an architectural framework for the LHS that incorporates five dimensional goals, scientific, social, technical, and ethical, commonly found in the LHS literature. The proposed architectural framework is made up of six decision layers that model these dimensions. The performance layer models the goals, the scientific layer models the scientific dimension, the organizational layer models the social dimension, the data layer and information technology layer model the technical dimension, and the ethics and security layer models the ethical dimension. We describe the types of decisions that need to be made within each layer and identify methods to support decision making. Conclusion In this paper, we describe a high-level architectural framework based on the conceptual and empirical LHS literature. Application of this architectural framework can guide the development and implementation of new LHS and the evolution of existing ones, as it enables a clear and critical understanding of the types of decisions that underlie LHS operations. More research is required to evaluate and refine its generalization and methods.",0,0,
196,Are non-specific practice guidelines potentially harmful? A randomized comparison of the effect of nonspecific versus specific guidelines on medical decision making.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of two different formats of clinical practice guidelines to influence the medical order for electrodiagnostic tests in low back pain. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of practice guidelines on physician self-reported test requesting behavior in response to a series of 12 clinical vignettes. Data came from a national random sample of 900 US neurologists, physical medicine physicians, and general internists. INTERVENTION: US Agency for Health Policy Low Back Panel Medical and Research developed two different versions of a practical guide to the use of electrodiagnostic tests (EDT). The two guidelines were similar in content but varied in the specificity of their recommendations. DATA COLLECTION: The proportion of clinical vignettes for which EDTs were ordered for appropriate and inappropriate clinical indications in each of the three groups of physicians were randomized to receive either vignettes alone, vignettes plus the nonspecific version of the guideline, or vignettes. plus the specific version of the guide. guide. MAIN FINDINGS: The survey response rate was 71 percent. The proportion of appropriate vignettes for which EDTs were ordered averaged 77 percent for the no-guidance group, 71 percent for the nonspecific guidance group, and 79 percent for the specific guidance group (p = 0.002). The corresponding values for the number of EDTs ordered by inappropriate vignettes were 32 percent, 32 percent, and 26 percent, respectively (p = 0.08). Pairwise comparisons showed that physicians who received the nonspecific guidelines requested fewer EDTs for appropriate clinical vignettes than physicians who did not receive the guidelines (p = 0.02). In addition, compared with physicians receiving nonspecific guidelines, physicians receiving specific guidelines ordered significantly more EDT for appropriate vignettes (p = 0.0007) and significantly less EDT for inappropriate vignettes (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Clarity and clinical applicability of a guideline may be important attributes that contribute to the effects of practice guidelines.",0,0,

This study aimed to catalog and categorize the range of psychotherapeutic interventions used by clinicians of a CAT team operating within a metropolitan area. METHODS: Self-report care episode data were collected regarding clinicians' views on the type of psychotherapeutic intervention they employed and details of what they discussed with patients, and the location and duration of interventions. RESULTS: 32 healthcare episodes were catalogued. On average, physicians spent 74% of their total contact time with patients participating in psychological interventions. A wide range of strategies were used, drawn from a broad theoretical base. In addition to general approaches that aid engagement, interventions can be classified into the following categories: meta-strategy (""treatment about treatment""), ""critical"", ""practical"", specific psychotherapeutic (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and others). ), and solidarity. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians found themselves spending most of their patient contact time involved in psychological interventions drawn from a broad theoretical base.

200,Are we adequately preparing the next generation of physicians to prescribe exercise for prevention and treatment? Residents express desire for more training in exercise prescription,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a key intervention for chronic diseases, yet few clinicians provide exercise prescription (PE). EP is an important component in broader strategies to reduce noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Our goal was to assess the knowledge, competency, and perspectives of PD family medicine residents (FMRs) to help inform future curriculum development. METHODS: A 49-item cross-sectional survey was administered to 396 FMRs from the University of British Columbia. Residents' knowledge, competence, attitudes/beliefs, current practices, personal physical activity levels, and training prospects were assessed primarily using a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS: The response rate was 80.6% (319/396). After removing 25 that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 294 were included in the final analysis. The majority, 95.6% of FMRs, reported that PE is important in their future practice, despite having low knowledge of Canadian PA guidelines (mean score 1.77/4), low self-reported competence to prescribing exercise as prevention (mean score 13.35/21) and classifying themselves as ""somewhat incompetent"" prescribing exercise to patients with chronic diseases (mean score 11.26/21). FMR believes that physical activity is an integral part of their patients' health (98.0%), sedentary behavior is detrimental (97.9%), and feels a responsibility to discuss physical activity with patients (99.7 %). Few FMR (14.9%) perceive their PE training as adequate and 91.0% want more. CONCLUSIONS: FMR reporting PE is important, they still do not perceive that they are sufficiently prepared to provide PE. In future curriculum development, medical educators should consider residents' low knowledge, competency, perceived support of the program, and their expressed desire for more training in exercise prescription.",0,0,
201,ARIA 2016: Care pathways that implement emerging technologies for predictive medicine in rhinitis and asthma throughout the life cycle,"The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative began during a World Health Organization workshop in 1999. The initial goals were (1) to propose a new classification of allergic rhinitis, (2) to promote the concept of multiple morbidity in asthma and rhinitis and (3) develop guidelines with all stakeholders that could be used globally for all countries and populations. ARIA, disseminated and implemented in more than 70 countries worldwide, is now focused on the implementation of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK [MACVIA (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif)-ARIA Sentinel Network] uses mobile technology to develop care pathways for the management of rhinitis and asthma by a multidisciplinary group and by patients themselves. An app (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analog scale to assess symptom control and work productivity, as well as a clinical decision support system. It is associated with an interoperable tablet for doctors and other health professionals. The expansion strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Association on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of the novel ARIA approach is to provide an active and healthy life for people suffering from rhinitis, regardless of their age, sex or socioeconomic level, in order to reduce the health and social inequalities generated by the disease.",0,0,
202,Top: Effects of an educational intervention on prescribing behavior on CVD prevention in general practice,"BACKGROUND: The evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions on the prescription of behavior modification in the prevention of cardiovascular disease is still insufficient. We evaluated the effects of a brief educational intervention on the prescription of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), platelet aggregation inhibitors (IPAs), and antihypertensive agents (HAs). DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial with general practitioner (GP) continuing medical education (CME) groups. METHODS: Prescription of statins, IPA and HA was verified before the start of the study (BL), immediately after the initial consultation (IC) and at follow-up after 6 months (FU). Prescription was considered adequate in high-risk patients (>15% risk of cardiovascular event in 10 years, according to the Framingham equation) and non-prescription in low-risk patients (<= 15%). RESULTS: Only an effect of intervention on prescription for IPA could be found. In general, all changes in prescribing over time were toward higher prescribing rates and persisted to FU, regardless of risk status and group assignment. CONCLUSIONS: Active implementation of a brief evidence-based educational intervention on global CVD risk did not directly lead to risk-adjusted changes in prescribing. Investigations on an extended time scale would capture whether decision support of this type would improve risk-adjusted prescribing in a sustainable way.",0,0,

204,"Assessing the availability of scientific journals, databases, and health library services in Canadian ministries of health: a cross-sectional study","Background Evidence-informed health policymaking logically depends on timely access to research evidence. To our knowledge, despite considerable political and social pressure to improve the use of the best available research evidence in making decisions about public health policies and programs, there is no study addressing the availability of peer-reviewed research. in Canadian ministries of health. Objectives To assess the availability of (1) a purposive sample of top-ranking scientific journals, (2) bibliographic databases, and (3) health library services in the fourteen Canadian ministries of health. Methods From May to October 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among librarians employed by Canadian ministries of health to collect information regarding the availability of scientific journals, bibliographic databases, and health library services. The availability of scientific journals in each ministry was determined using a sample of 48 journals selected from the 2009 Journal Citation Reports (Science and Social Science Editions). The selection criteria were: relevance to health policy based on information from the scope note on thematic categories and popularity of the journal based on impact factors. Results We found that most Canadian ministries of health did not have subscription access to key journals and relied heavily on interlibrary loans. Overall, based on a sample of high-ranking scientific journals, journal availability through interlibrary loan, online subscription, and print-only was estimated at 63%, 28%, and 3%, respectively. Health Canada had 2.3 times more magazine subscriptions than the average for provincial ministries. Most organizations provided access to numerous multidisciplinary and discipline-specific databases. Many organizations provided access to the library resources described through library associations or consortia. No practitioner-led health library setting was found in four of the fourteen Canadian ministries of health (i.e., Manitoba Health, Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services, Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services, and Yukon Department of Health and Human Services). Conclusions There is unevenness in the availability of peer-reviewed research across the fourteen Canadian ministries of health. This inequity could present a problem, since each province and territory is responsible for formulating and implementing evidence-based health policies and services for the benefit of its population.",0,0,
205,Evaluation of the impact of national guidelines on the treatment of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis,"BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is a common illness accounting for $500 million in hospitalizations annually. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and management is variable. To address this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two academic medical centers of children <24 months of age admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis at primary or secondary discharge. Pre-guidelines from 2004 to 2005 and post-guidelines from 2007 to 2008 were collected. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions were analyzed before and during hospitalization. Data were analyzed using chi-square analysis for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Diagnostic laboratory test rates did not decrease after publication of the guideline. The number of chest radiographs obtained decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% after the guidelines (P = 0.02). Fewer children received a trial of racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P = .006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P < .0001) after the guidelines, and physicians more frequently discontinued albuterol when its ineffectiveness was documented in the publication. -period of the guidelines (28.6% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use in children without a history of ADR or asthma decreased after guidelines (26.5% vs. 17.5%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A modest change in the behavior of physicians in the hospital management of bronchiolitis was observed after the guidelines. Additional training and education of health care providers is warranted to reduce unnecessary interventions and use of health care resources.",0,0,
206,Evaluation of Treatment as Usual Provided to Control Groups in Adherence Trials: Exploring the Use of an Open Questionnaire to Identify Behavior Change Techniques,"OBJECTIVE: Reporting guidelines require descriptions of control group support in the same detail as the interventions. However, it is still unclear how to assess the active content (behaviour change techniques (BCT)) of treatment as usual (TAU) given to control groups in trials. The aim of this study is to pre-test a TAU assessment method in a multicenter cost-effectiveness trial of an HIV treatment adherence intervention. DESIGN: HIV nurses (N = 21) completed an open-ended, semi-structured questionnaire asking about TAU adherence counseling. Two coders independently coded BCT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Completeness and clarity of nurses' responses, inter-coder reliability, and type of BCTs reported were examined. RESULTS: The clarity and completeness of the nurses' responses were adequate. Twenty-three of the 26 identified BCTs could be reliably coded (mean kappa = 0.79""; mean agreement rate = 96%) and three BCTs scored below kappa = 0.60. The total number of BCTs reported per nurse ranged from 7 to 19 (M = 13.86, SD = 3.35).CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the TAU open-ended questionnaire is a feasible and reliable tool for capturing the active content of support provided to control participants in a multicentre adherence intervention trial Considerable variability was observed in the amount of BCT provided to control patients, illustrating the importance of reliably collecting and accurately reporting control group support.",0,0,
207,Lifestyle assessment and management of patients with obesity: clinical recommendations from systematic reviews,"SIGNIFICANCE: Although one-third of American adults are obese, rates of obesity identification and treatment remain low. Physician engagement is vital in providing overweight or obese patients with guidance and assistance in addressing the underlying cause of many chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To describe current best practices for lifestyle assessment and management of obesity and to demonstrate how the Updated Guidelines (2013) for the management of overweight and obesity in adults based on a systematic review of evidence sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) may apply to an individual patient. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The systematic evidence review conducted for the Guidelines (2013) for the management of overweight and obesity in adults supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, benefits for weight loss, diets for weight loss, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches, and bariatric surgery)""; for areas outside this scope, the recommendations are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, the 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those of the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian and American professional societies, such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Society of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2008); a PubMed search identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity , motivational interviewing for weight control, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and pharmacotherapy for obesity. step in managing obesity ment is to screen all adults for overweight and obesity. A medical history should be obtained that assesses the multiple determinants of obesity, including dietary and physical activity patterns, psychosocial factors, weight-gain medications, and family traits. The emphasis on complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit most from treatment is more helpful than using body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) alone for treatment decisions. The Guidelines (2013) recommend that clinicians offer patients who would benefit from weight loss (either a BMI of >/=30 with or without comorbidities or >/=25 along with 1 comorbidity or risk factor) a multicomponent intensive behavioral intervention. Some doctors do this within their primary care practices; others refer patients to these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through modification of eating and physical activity behaviors. The Guidelines (2013) support comprehensive lifestyle management through intensive intervention. Treatment can be implemented either in a doctor's office or by referral to a registered dietitian or commercial weight loss program. The usual goal is a 5% to 10% weight loss. Patients do not need to achieve a BMI of less than 25 to achieve a health benefit. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening and evaluation of patients for obesity, followed by initiation or referral of treatment, should be incorporated into primary care practice settings. If clinicians can identify appropriate patients for weight loss efforts and provide informed advice and assistance on how to achieve and maintain modest weight loss, they will address the underlying driver of many such as morbidities and can have a great influence on the health status of patients.",0,0,
208,Assessment of a remote collaborative program for the treatment of depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Primary care teams play an important role in the treatment of depression, whose effectiveness improves when they are inserted in a collaborative model of disease management. OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a clinical trial conducted to test the efficacy of a collaborative program between primary care teams and specialists supported by an electronic platform. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Physicians from four community hospitals belonging to the Reloncavi Health Service network recruited 81 patients with depression between the ages of 37 and 43, of whom 84% were women. Participants were divided into an active group, which participated in the collaborative program, and a control group, which received usual care, according to the Ministry of Health Depression Guidelines. The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) score three months after the intervention. RESULTS: Participants had a mean of 29.6 points (95% CI: 27.6-31.6) on the BDI-I and 38% of them were at high risk of suicide. There were no statistically significant baseline differences between the active and control groups. In the intervention group, the BDI-I score changed from 30.0 (95% CI: 27.0 to 32.8) to 15.3 (95% CI: 11.8 to 18.8). In the control group, the score changed from 29.2 (95% CI: 26.4-31.9) points to 20.8 (95% CI: 16.8 to 24.7). The decline was significantly greater in the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Such a program may be useful in helping primary care teams in remote areas of the country improve depression treatment outcomes.",0,0,
209,Evaluation of a pay-for-performance program in primary care designed by target users.,"Background: Evidence of pay-for-performance (P4P) has been sought over the past decade as financial incentives to influence the behavior of health professionals to improve quality of care have increased. The effectiveness of P4P is inconclusive, although some reviews have reported significant effects. Objective: To assess changes in performance after the introduction of a participatory P4P program. Design: Observational study with pre-post measurement. Scope and topics: Sixty-five general practices in the south of the Netherlands. Intervention: a P4P program designed by target users that contains indicators for chronic care, prevention, practice management and patient experience (general practitioner [GP] functioning and organization of care). Quality indicators were calculated for each practice. A bonus with a maximum of 6890 euros per 1000 patients was determined by comparing the performance of the practice with a reference point. Main outcome measures: Indicators of quality of clinical care (process and outcome) and patient experience. Results: 60 practices were included. After 1 year, significant improvement in process indicators was shown for all chronic conditions, from +7.9% improvement for cardiovascular risk management to +11.5% for asthma. Five outcome indicators improved significantly, as did patients' experiences with the functioning and organization of GP care. No significant improvements were seen in the rate of vaccination against influenza or in the acceptance of cervical cancer screening tests. Clinical process and outcome indicators, as well as patient experience indicators, were affected by the baseline measures. Smaller practices showed more improvements. Conclusions: A participatory P4P program could stimulate quality improvement in clinical care and improve patients' experiences with the functioning of the GP and the organization of care.

210,Evaluation of support for the decision to request blood tests in primary care. a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Different methods of changing blood test ordering behavior in primary care have been shown to be effective. However, randomized trials comparing these methods are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of two versions of BloodLink, a computerized clinical decision support system, on blood test ordering among general practitioners. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: 44 general practitioner practices in the Delft region, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 60 general practitioners in 44 practices who used computer-based patient records in their practices. INTERVENTION: After stratification by individual practices and group practices, practices were randomly assigned to use either BloodLink-Restricted, which initially displays a shortened list of tests, or BloodLink-Guideline, which is based on the Dutch College of General Practitioners guidelines. . MEASUREMENTS: Average number of blood tests ordered per order form per practice. RESULTS: General practitioners using BloodLink-Guideline ordered 20% fewer tests on average than physicians using BloodLink-Restricted (mean [+/-SD], 5.5 +/- 0.9 tests vs. 6, 9 +/- 1.6 tests, respectively) ;"" P = 0.003, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-based decision support is more effective in changing blood test requesting behavior than decision support. based on initially showing a limited number of tests Guideline-based decision support systems may be effective in reducing the number of laboratory tests ordered by primary care physicians.",1,1,
211,Evaluation of radiology referral practice and the effect of computer-based guidelines on radiology requests in two emergency departments.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess emergency medical radiology referral practice against a set of French guidelines and measure the efficiency of computer-based guidelines on unnecessary medical imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All radiological requests were computerized in the medical emergency services of two French university hospitals. During the control periods, radiological requests were recorded but no action was taken. During intervention periods, on-screen reminder displays prompted appropriate recommendations. Three control periods and three intervention periods of 1 month each were carried out. The percentage of requests that did not conform to the guidelines and the variation related to the control and intervention periods were measured. RESULTS: The proportion of requests not conforming to guidelines was 33·2% when guidelines were inactive and decreased to 26·9% when recommendations were active (P < 0·0001). The three imaging tests (chest x-rays, plain abdominal x-rays, and brain computed tomography) accounted for more than 80% of all requests; more than 50% of requests for plain abdominal radiographs did not meet the recommendations, while this percentage was respectively 24·9% and 15·8% for chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the brain. Seven situations represented 70% of non-compliant radiological references; in these situations, the knowledge of the young doctors was inadequate. CONCLUSION: Although the computer provided advice that was tailored to the needs of individual patients, along with care, the effect of our intervention was weak. However, our study identified the few situations that were responsible for the most unnecessary radiological requests;"" We hope that this result can help clinicians and radiologists to develop more specific actions for these situations.

212,Assessing self-harm in an emergency department and accidents: developing a proforma to assess suicidal intent and mental status in those presenting to the emergency department with self-harm,"INTRODUCTION: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of self-harm in Europe, around 400 per 100,000 inhabitants (Horrocks et al. 2002). It accounts for 150,000 emergency department visits each year and is one of the top five causes of acute medical admissions in the UK (NICE 2002). OBJECTIVES: Objectives included to explore the method of self-harm and the demographics of those presenting to the emergency department with self-harm. In addition, we wanted to review the ED physician's screening for suicide risk factors and suicidal intent and determine if a psychiatric evaluation with a full mental status examination with referral to psychiatric services had been performed if appropriate. considered necessary. We wanted to explore current practice around self-harm presentations to the emergency department in accordance with NICE guidelines. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from February to August 2009. Twenty-five sets of medical notes from patients who had presented with self-harm in the emergency department were randomly collated. Notes were reviewed for evidence of event exploration, psychiatric evaluation, risk factors for suicide, and subsequent referral. RESULTS: 14 of the 25 patients had an overdose. 9 had inflicted some other form of self-harm, namely lacerations on himself. In 2 cases a mixed presentation was found. Previous psychiatric history was documented in 16 cases. 11 had a history of depression or anxiety disorder”; 1 was known to have bipolar affective disorder; 1 was diagnosed in the past with borderline personality disorder; and 3 patients had no prior history. In 9 cases no antecedents were documented. DISCUSSION: Twenty-five sets of medical notes from February to August 2009 from people presenting to the emergency department with self-injury were reviewed. Of these, 12 corresponded to the age group of more than 25. 17 were women and 8 were men. Most of the patients were of white British ethnicity. 14 had taken an overdose; 9 had inflicted some other form of self-harm; and 2 had a mixed presentation. Suicide risk factors and suicidal intent were poorly documented and mental status examination was found to be undocumented in the 25 cases reviewed. 18 were deemed medically fit in the emergency department and were referred for psychiatric review. These unfortunate findings may be a reflection of the time pressures emergency department physicians face, namely four-hour targets, and perhaps a lack of adequate training in psychosocial risk assessment. With such poor documentation by ED physicians, a proforma was developed that incorporates suicide risk factors and assessment of suicidal intent in addition to a brief version of the mental status exam. CONCLUSION: The Royal College of Psychiatrists' recent report on self-harm has raised concerns, that the current level of care provided to service users does not meet the standards set out in policies and guidelines, with poor assessments, unqualified staff and avenues of insufficient care (Royal College of Psychiatrists Report CR 158. 2010). Indeed, evidence suggests that appropriate training and intervention provided to A&E personnel can lead to improvements in the quality of psychosocial assessment of patients with deliberate self-harm (Crawford et al. 1998).",0,0,
213,Evaluation of the potential impact of a reminder system in reducing diagnostic errors: a quasi-experimental study,"Background Computerized decision support systems (DSS) have primarily focused on improving clinicians' diagnostic accuracy in unusual and challenging cases. However, as errors of omission in diagnosis may predominantly result from incomplete study in routine clinical practice, the provision of appropriate patient- and context-specific reminders may have a greater impact on patient safety. In this experimental study, a combination of easy and difficult simulated cases was used to assess the impact of a novel diagnostic recall system (ISABEL) on the quality of clinical decisions made by various grades of physicians during acute assessment. Methods Subjects of varying grades (consultants, registrars, senior house officials, and medical students) evaluated a balanced set of 24 simulated cases on a test website. The subjects recorded their clinical decisions for the cases (differential diagnosis, request for tests and treatment), before and after consulting the system. A panel of two pediatric consultants independently provided gold standard answers for each case, against which the quality of the subjects' decisions was measured. The primary outcome measure was change in diagnostic errors by omission (OED) count. A more sensitive assessment of the impact of the system was achieved using specific quality scores""; the additional consultation time resulting from the use of DSS was also calculated. Results 76 subjects (18 consultants, 24 registrars, 19 senior house officers and 15 students ) case episodes.The mean OED count decreased from 5.5 to 5.0 in all subjects (repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.001), with no significant interaction with subject rating. diagnostic quality increased after consultation of the system (0.044; ""95% confidence interval 0.032, 0.054). ISABEL reminded subjects to consider at least one clinically important diagnosis in 1 out of 8 case episodes and urged them to request an important test in 1 out of 10 case episodes. The additional median time for the DSS consultation was 1 min (IQR: 30 sec to 2 min). Conclusion The provision of patient- and context-specific reminders has the potential to reduce diagnostic omissions across all subject grades for a variety of cases. This study suggests a promising role for the use of future reminder-based DSS in reducing diagnostic error.",0,1,
214,Association between the pharmaceutical detail policies of the academic medical center and the medical prescription,"Significance In an effort to regulate physician conflicts of interest, some U.S. academic medical centers (AMCs) have enacted policies restricting visits by pharmaceutical sales representatives to physicians (known as medical details). ) between 2006 and 2012. Little is known about the effect of these policies on medical prescription. . Objective To analyze the association between the detailed policies promulgated in the AMC and the medical prescription of actively detailed and non-detailed drugs. Design, Setting, and Participants The study used difference-in-difference multivariate regression analysis to compare changes in physician prescribing before and after implementation of detailed policies at AMCs in 5 states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts , Pennsylvania, and New York) who made up the prescribing change intervention group by a matched control group of similar physicians not subject to a detail policy. Exhibitions Implementation of the academic medical center of policies that regulate the visits of pharmaceutical vendors to treating physicians. Key Outcomes and Measures The monthly market share within the drug class of prescriptions written by an individual physician for listed and non-listed drugs across 8 drug classes (lipid-lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs, medications, antihypertensive medications, approved hypnotic medications for the treatment of insomnia [sleep aids], medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, antidepressant medications, and antipsychotic medications) comparing the period of 10 to 36 months before the implementation of detailed policies with the period of 12 to 36 months after implementation, depending on data availability. Results The analysis included 16,121,483 prescriptions written between January 2006 and June 2012 by 2,126 attending physicians in the 19 AMCs in the intervention group and by 24,593 physicians in the matched control group. The average market share of the sample at the doctor-drug-month level for listed and non-listed medications before the enactment of the policies was 19.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Exposure to an AMC itemized policy was associated with a decline in itemized drug market share of 1.67 percentage points (95% CI, ?2.18 to ?1.18 percentage points""; P?<? .001) and an increase in non-detailed drug market share of 0.84 percentage points (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.14 percentage points; P?, antihypertensive drugs, sleeping pills, sleep disorder drugs attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and antidepressant medications) and for 9 of 19 AMCs that implemented policies Eleven of 19 AMCs regulated vendor gifts to physicians, restricted vendor access to facilities, and incorporated enforcement mechanisms. For 8 of these 11 AMCs, there was a significant change in prescription In contrast, there was a significant change in only 1 of 8 AMCs that did not enact policies in all 3 areas Conclusions and Relevance e Policy implementation in AMCs that restricted n pharmaceutical detailing between 2006 and 2012 was associated with modest but significant reductions in the prescription of detailed drugs in 6 of the 8 main drug classes; however, no change was seen in all AMCs that enacted policies.",0,0,

Objectives To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to explore possible molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed relationships. Design, Setting, and Participants Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3756 Mexican and US Latino individuals (1794 with type 2 diabetes and 1962 without diabetes) recruited between 1993 and 2013. One variant was further tested to determine allele frequency and association with type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic data sets of 14 to 276 participants and characterized in experimental trials. Main outcome and measures Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included age at onset, body mass index, and effect on protein function. Results A single rare missense variant (c.1522G>A [p.E508K]) was associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 5.48""; 95% CI, 2.83-10; 61; P = 4.4?¡Ã ?10?7) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-Â¦Ã (HNF1A), the gene responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3).

The mean age (SD) of the carriers was 45.3 years (11.2) compared to 47.5 years (11.5) of the non-carriers (P?=?0.49) and the mean BMI (SD ) of carriers was 28.2 (5.5) versus 29.3 (5.3) of carriers. non-carriers (P?=?.19). Conclusions and Relevance Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the HNF1A gene causing MODY3 that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may affect protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but further study is required.",0,0,
217,Association of combatant status and sexual violence with health and mental health outcomes in post-conflict Liberia,"Context Liberia's wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized. Objectives To assess the prevalence and impact of war-related psychosocial trauma, including information on involvement in Liberia's civil wars, exposure to sexual violence, social functioning and mental health. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional, population-based, multistage random cluster survey of 1,666 adults aged 18 years and older using structured interviews and questionnaires, conducted over a 3-week period in May 2008 in Liberia. Main outcome measures Major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, social functioning, exposure to sexual violence, and health and mental health needs among Liberian adults who witnessed or participated in conflict during the last 2 decades. Results In the Liberian adult household C-based population, 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-45%""; n = 672/1659) met symptom criteria for MDD, 44% (95% CI, 38%-49%; n=718/1661) met criteria for PTSD symptoms, and 8% (95% CI, 5%-10%; n=133/1666) met criteria of social dysfunction 33% of respondents (549/1,666) reported serving time in the fighting forces, and 33.2% of surveyed veterans (182/549) were women Veterans experienced higher rates of exposure to sexual violence than noncombatants: among women, 42.3% (95% CI, 35.4%-49.1% vs. 9.2% (95% CI, 6.7%-11.7 %), respectively, among men, 32.6% (95% CI, 27.6%-37.6%) vs. 7.4% (95% CI, 4.5%-10.4%). of PTSD, MDD, and suicidal ideation symptoms were higher among veterans than among noncombatants and among those who experienced violence. sexual ia versus those who do not. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms among female veterans who experienced sexual violence (74%) 95% CI, 63%-84%) was higher than among those who did not experience sexual violence (44%; 95% CI, 33%-53% ). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms among male veterans who experienced sexual violence was higher (81%; 95% CI, 74%-87%) than among male veterans who did not experience sexual violence (46%; 95% CI, 39%-52 %). Male ex-combatants who experienced sexual violence also reported higher rates of symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation.

218,Association of Socioeconomic Position with Health Behaviors and Mortality,"Context Previous studies may have underestimated the contribution of health behaviors to social inequalities in mortality because health behaviors were assessed only at study baseline. Objective To examine the role of health behaviors in the association between socioeconomic position and mortality and to compare whether their contribution differs when assessed at a single point in time with longitudinal assessment over the follow-up period. Design, Setting, and Participants Established in 1985, the British Whitehall II Longitudinal Cohort Study includes 10,308 civil servants, aged 35 to 55, living in London, England. Analyzes are based on 9,590 men and women followed for mortality through April 30, 2009. Socioeconomic position was derived from the degree of civil service employment (high, intermediate, and low) at baseline. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical activity were assessed 4 times during the follow-up period. Main outcome measures Mortality from all causes and from specific causes. Results A total of 654 participants died during the follow-up period. In analyzes adjusted for sex and year of birth, those with the lowest socioeconomic status had a 1.60 times greater risk of death from all causes than those with the highest socioeconomic status (a rate difference of 1.94/1000). person-years). This association was attenuated by 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-94%) when baseline-assessed health behaviors were entered into the model and by 72% (95% CI, 42% %-154%) when entered as time-dependent covariates. The corresponding attenuations were 29% (95% CI, 11%-54%) and 45% (95% CI, 24%-79%) for cardiovascular mortality and 61% (95% CI, 16%-425%) and 94 % (95% CI, 35%-595%) for mortality not related to cancer and cardiovascular disease. The difference between baseline only and repeated assessments of health behaviors was primarily due to higher explanatory power of diet (7% to 17% for all-cause mortality, respectively), physical activity ( 5% to 21% for all causes). cause-related mortality) and alcohol use (3% to 12% for all-cause mortality). The role of smoking, the strongest mediator in these analyses, did not change when baseline or repeat assessments were used (32% to 35% for all-cause mortality). Conclusion In a civil service population in London, England, there was an association between socioeconomic position and mortality that was substantially explained by adjustment of health behaviors, particularly when behaviors were repeatedly assessed.",0,0,
219,Asthma education program in Russia: educating patients,"To address the recent increase in asthma morbidity and mortality in Russia, an intervention study was conducted to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of asthma. The American recommendations for asthma management have been adapted for use in the education of Moscow families with children with asthma. Two hundred and fifty-two children with asthma aged 4 to 14 years receiving medical care at eight Moscow public health clinics along with their parents were enrolled in the study to see if American teaching manuals for asthma control would be acceptable and effective. in Russia. Children from four of the clinics with recent asthma attacks were randomly assigned to the education or control group to assess whether patient education and guided asthma care would improve outcomes for patients. Modern drugs were made available to both groups to see if training in US guidelines was needed to get doctors to use the drugs. Children with recent asthma attacks at the other four clinics were defined as comparison group 1 to control for the possible effect of medication availability. All children from the eight clinics who did not have asthma attacks formed comparison group 2 to see if these children's results would change over time. One-year follow-up results showed significant improvement in children's and parents' asthma self-management skills, in terms of asthma treatment, only among those in the education group. Significant increases were seen in the subgroup of children in the education group using anti-inflammatory medications for asthma control. Children in the education group had markedly increased peak flow rates and reduced daily peak flow variability compared to control and comparison groups. There was a significantly greater reduction in doctor visits by the educational group of children compared to the control.

Lessons from the use of modern reproductive technologies.,"The use of modern reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization and its related procedures, has opened up new areas of legal, religious, and public interest. Thirty years ago, the development of effective methods to control procreation sparked a debate about whether couples had a right to enjoy sex in the absence of its procreative effect. Today, assisted reproductive technology (ART) allows couples to have their own children in the absence of direct intermediation of sex. The Catholic Church has reacted against contraception and ART, and specific instructions have been directed to the public, the medical profession and legislators. In a recent survey, 88.4% of the population in Latin America say they are Catholic"";"" therefore, bioethical considerations and legal implications regarding reproductive intervention are strongly permeated by the moral teachings of Catholicism. In 1996, 83 physicians and scientists, participating in the Latin American Network for Assisted Reproduction, produced a consensus document on ethical aspects and legal implications of ART. The document contains minimum ethical guidelines to which Latin American professionals have decided to adhere, even in the absence of legal regulations. This article examines how the medical profession, policymakers, and the public react to religious influence when faced with difficult bioethical decisions such as the right to procreate.",0,0,
221,Audit and feedback as a clinical practice guideline implementation strategy: a model for acute care nursing professionals,"BACKGROUND: Transferring research evidence to practice and changing provider behavior is challenging, even when the benefits are significant. Despite the availability of supportive care clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), consistent integration of these principles into practice has not been achieved. The failure of dissemination strategies has been identified as a key barrier to successful implementation. A potentially effective approach to facilitating the transfer of evidence from research to practice is audit and feedback. The audit and feedback is a summary of the provider's performance over a specified period of time, with or without recommendations to improve practice. RATIONALE: Cancer pain is an optimal symptom to examine when studying the effect of an audit and feedback intervention. It is a common condition with important consequences, there are established CPGs, measurable results are defined and there is potential for improvement in current practice. Intensive care (NP) nurse practitioners are often responsible for directly monitoring and managing symptoms such as pain and are well positioned to implement CPGs and study the effects of guideline adherence on patient pain outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of published articles, MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Related Health Literature, and Cochrane Library computerized databases was conducted to assess the state of the science on audit and feedback as a change strategy. professional practice. A behavior change model is proposed for application to advanced practice nursing. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Recognized in medicine as a valuable intervention to improve the quality of medical care, audit and feedback is a strategy that has not been widely studied in nursing. Although cancer pain cannot always be completely eliminated, appropriate use of available therapies can effectively relieve pain in most patients. This article is a review of the literature on audit and feedback as a professional practice change strategy and indicates a model to operationalize the intervention.",0,1,
222,Audit and Feedback: Effects on Professional Practice and Health Care Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback continue to be widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice. It seems logical that health professionals are forced to modify their practice if they receive feedback that their clinical practice is not consistent with that of their peers or with accepted guidelines. However, audit and feedback have not been found to be consistently effective. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of audit and feedback on health professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Group for Effective Practice and Organization of Care Register and Pending Archive were searched up to January 2004. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized audit and feedback trials (defined as any summary of clinical performance during a specified time period) that objectively reported professional practice measured in a healthcare setting or healthcare outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual and qualitative analyzes were performed. For each comparison, we calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR), adjusted for baseline compliance where possible, for dichotomous outcomes and the percentage and percentage change relative to the treatment group mean. post-intervention control, adjusted for baseline performance where possible, for continuous outcomes. We investigated the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: type of intervention (audit and feedback alone, audit and feedback with educational meetings, or multifaceted interventions that included audit and feedback), intensity of audit and feedback, the complexity of the target behavior, the seriousness of the result, the baseline compliance, and the quality of the study. MAIN RESULTS: 30 new studies have been added to this update and a total of 118 studies are included. In the primary analysis we included 88 comparisons from 72 studies comparing any intervention in which audit and feedback was a component compared to no intervention. For dichotomous outcomes, the adjusted risk difference for adherence to desired practice ranged from -0.16 (a 16% absolute decrease in adherence) to 0.70 (a 70% increase in adherence) (median=0. 05, interquartile range = 0.03 to 0.11) and the adjusted hazard ratio ranged from 0.71 to 18.3 (median = 1.08, interquartile range = 0.99 to 1.30). For continuous outcomes, the adjusted percentage change relative to control ranged from -0.10 (a 10% absolute decrease in compliance) to 0.68 (a 68% increase in compliance) (median = 0, 16, interquartile range = 0.05 to 0.37). Low baseline compliance with recommended practice and higher audit and feedback intensity were associated with larger adjusted hazard ratios (higher effectiveness) across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Audit and feedback can be effective in improving professional practice. When effective, the effects are generally small to moderate. The relative effectiveness of audit and feedback is likely to be higher when initial adherence to recommended practice is low and when feedback is delivered more intensively.",0,1,
223,Audit of a tuberculosis contact tracing clinic,"OBJECTIVE To determine the efficiency of tuberculosis contact tracing in South Glamorgan 1987-9. DESIGN Review of contact tracing clinic records and Mycobacterium Reference Unit data. Clinic practice was compared with the 1983 British Thoracic Society recommendations. SETTING Health Authority Tuberculosis Control Programme. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of contacts screened, follow-up rates, number of secondary cases detected, and quality of record keeping. RESULTS One hundred and one index patients and 611 contacts were identified. 596 (97.5%) contacts were screened, of which 139 should not have been. Of 356 contacts who required a Heaf test, 237 were evaluated, seven refused testing, and 112 had a chest radiograph without a Heaf test. 95 contacts were unnecessarily tested. Eighty-seven contacts had chest radiography unnecessarily, and seven should have had it but did not. Thirty-four contacts were inappropriately given follow-up appointments and seven were missed for follow-up. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in five asymptomatic contacts, all at initial screening and all close contacts of index patients with lung disease. CONCLUSION Inadequate data, lack of adherence to contact tracing guidelines, and lack of definition of the term highly infectious index case resulted in many contacts being unnecessarily tested or followed up. IMPLICATIONS The efficiency of contact tracing would be improved by specifying the smear results and ethnicity of the index case on the reporting form, clearly classifying contacts as close or causal, and clearly defining the term highly infectious.",0,0,
224,Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression,"BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) is coordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, funded by the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Ministry of Health. METHOD: The CPG team reviewed the literature on treatment outcomes, consulted with clinicians and patients, and performed meta-analyses of outcome research. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish an effective therapeutic relationship""; provide the patient with information about the condition, the rationale for treatment, the likelihood of a positive response, and the expected time frame; consider the patient's strengths, life stresses, and supports. The choice of treatment depends on the skills of the clinician and the circumstances and preferences of the patient, and should be guided but not determined by these guidelines.In moderately severe depression, all recognized antidepressants, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are equally effective;"" clinicians must consider the burdens of treatment as well as the benefits, including side effects and toxicity. In severe depression, antidepressant treatment should precede psychological therapy. For depression with psychosis, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or a tricyclic combined with an antipsychotic are equally helpful. Treatments for other subtypes are discussed. Caution is necessary in people with other medications or with medical conditions. If the response to an adequate trial of a first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used. Second opinions are helpful. Depression has a high rate of recurrence and efforts to reduce it are crucial.",0,0,
225,Author's Disclosure of Conflict of Interest in Vascular Surgery Journals,"OBJECTIVES: Advances in vascular surgery are increasingly technology-driven, and relationships between surgeons and the medical device industry can be complex. This study reviewed conflict of interest (COI) disclosure in vascular surgery journals regarding several selected technology-driven topics, including endovascular stent grafting (EVS), carotid artery stenting (CAS) and peripheral arterial interventions (PI), to suggest new directions. . METHODS: The authors' COI disclosures were reviewed from all clinical articles published in 2008 and 2009 in each of the six vascular surgery journals, and pertaining to three selected topics (EV, CAS, and PI). COI disclosure rate was assessed based on journal, subject, article type (randomized trial, case series, case report, review, or meta-analysis), and authors' region of origin. Second, consistency of author disclosure was assessed by reviewing articles by the same author and on the same topic. RESULTS: Six hundred thirty-five articles from the six journals were reviewed. COI was declared in 125 (19.7%) of these documents. This rate differed between journals (range, 3.2%-34.1%""; P < .0001). Disclosure rate did not differ between topics (range, 12.8%-21.2%; P = .12), article type (range, 14.7%-30%; p = 0.28), or region of origin (range, 0%-33.3%; ""p = 0.09). There were 116 cases where the same author wrote articles describing the same general topic. COI disclosure was consistent in most of these cases (72.4%), but inconsistent in 32 cases (27.6%). The most common inconsistencies (p = 0.006) involved the same type of article in different journals (46.9%) or in the same journal (25%). CONCLUSIONS: COI disclosure rates and disclosure inconsistencies in the vascular surgery literature are due, at least partially, to differences in journal reporting policies, whereas a smaller proportion of these inconsistencies are due to individual behavior of the author. Journals should adopt a consistent requirement for a separate COI statement disclosing all relevant financial arrangements.",0,0,

227,Automated hand hygiene audit with and without intervention,"BACKGROUND: Continuous automated audit daily feedback with a peer reminder intervention was used to improve compliance. Compliance rates for the automated overt and covert audit phases with and without intervention were compared to mandatory human audits. METHODS: An automated system was installed to covertly detect hand hygiene events with each press of the alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispenser for 5 months. The open phase included key physicians trained to share daily rates with physicians, set compliance goals, and encourage each other to comply for 6 months. For another 6 months, the intervention continued without cooling. Hand Hygiene Australia (HHA) human audits were performed quarterly during the intervention in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Percentage point (PP) differences between compliance rates were used to determine change. RESULTS: The HHA rates for June 2014 were 85% and 87% in the medical and surgical wards, respectively. These rates were 55 PPs and 38 PPs higher than the covert automation rates for June 2014 in the medical and surgical suite at 30% and 49%, respectively. During the intervention phase, mean compliance in the medical room did not change from its covert rate, while the surgical room improved compared to the covert phase by 11 PPs at 60%. On average, compliance during the intervention without cooling did not change in the medical room, while the average rate in the surgical room decreased by 9 PP. CONCLUSIONS: Automation provided a unique opportunity to respond to daily rates, but compliance will return to pre-intervention levels once active intervention ceases or human auditors leave the room, unless clinicians commit to change .",1,1,
228,Automated identification of postoperative complications within an electronic medical record using natural language processing,"Context Currently, most automated methods for identifying patient safety incidents are based on administrative data codes"";"" however, free text searches of electronic medical records could represent an additional surveillance approach. Objective To evaluate a natural language processing search approach to identify postoperative surgical complications within a comprehensive electronic medical record. Design, setting, and patients Cross-sectional study involving 2974 patients who underwent inpatient surgical procedures at 6 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers from 1999 to 2006. Main outcome measures Postoperative occurrences of acute renal failure requiring dialysis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction identified through review of medical records as part of the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the natural language processing approach to identify these complications and compared its performance with patient safety indicators using discharge coding information. Results The proportion of postoperative events for each sample was 2% (39 of 1,924) for acute renal failure requiring dialysis, 0.7% (18 of 2,327) for pulmonary embolism, 1% (29 of 2,327) for deep vein thrombosis, 7% (61 of 866) for sepsis, 16% (222 of 1405) for pneumonia, and 2% (35 of 1822) for myocardial infarction. Natural language processing correctly identified 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-91%) of acute kidney injury cases compared with 38% (95% CI, 25%-54 %) for patient safety indicators. Similar results were obtained for venous thromboembolism (59%, 95% CI, 44%-72% vs 46%, 95% CI, 32%-60%), pneumonia (64%, 95% CI, 58%-70% vs 5%, 95% CI, 3%-9%), sepsis (89%, 95% CI, 78%-94% vs. 34%, 95% CI, 24%-47%), and myocardial infarction postoperative (91%, 95% CI, 78%-97%) vs 89%, 95% CI, 74%-96%). Both natural language processing and patient safety indicators were highly specific to these diagnoses. Conclusion Among patients who underwent inpatient surgical procedures at VA medical centers, natural language processing analysis of electronic medical records to identify postoperative complications had higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared to safety indicators. of the patient based on discharge coding.",0,0,
229,Availability and prescribing practice of malaria drugs in the private health sector in Yemen,"INTRODUCTION: Although the Yemeni government changed the national policy for malaria treatment in November 2005 from chloroquine to a drug combination in the form of artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line treatment and lumefantrine + artemether as treatment treatment for uncomplicated malaria, doctors in public and private health facilities continued to prescribe chloroquine because their knowledge of the new treatment policy was poor. METHODOLOGY: A non-randomized pre-post evaluation trial of training and reporting interventions on prescribing behaviors and antimalarial drug availability among private sector physicians and pharmacists was conducted in three governorates of Yemen. RESULTS: Adherence of private sector physicians to new national guidelines for antimalarial drugs improved from 21% pre-intervention to 38% post-intervention to prescribe artesunate + SP as first-line treatment. The prescription of lumefantrine + artemether as second-line antimalarial treatment also improved from 18% before the intervention to 22% after the intervention. Unfortunately, the combination of halofantrine + SP continued to be frequently prescribed by doctors in the city of Sana'a (18%). Artesunate + SP and quinine are increasing their commercialization significantly from 8% in the pre-intervention period to 22% post-intervention (P value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of the usefulness of the training intervention on national guidelines for the treatment of malaria. In addition, the involvement of private health care providers in notification procedures will promote the rational prescription and availability of antimalarial drugs.",0,0,
230,Available screening tools for adults with bipolar affective disorder in primary care: an integrative review of the literature.,"PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of six tools used in primary care for the detection of bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). Historically, BPAD has been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, followed by inadequate treatment leading to harmful relapses, suicide, and increased risks of comorbidities. DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was performed to identify articles in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, National Guideline Clearinghouse, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences collection, and PsycARTICLES. Other information was also collected from NIH, CDC, Healthy People 2020, the Black Dog Institute, and the Center for Quality Assessment and Improvement for Mental Health. CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates that primary care providers are often the first and sometimes the only providers, signifying the importance of early detection and screening for BPAD in primary care. By implementing the use of proper screening tools and following recommended treatment and intervention guidelines, relapse prevention is increased and comorbidities are diagnosed more frequently, leading to an overall better quality of life. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Primary care physicians play a vital role in properly screening for BPAD and implementing recommended treatments to increase relapse prevention and promote a healthier and more socially successful quality of life.",0,0,
231,Barriers and facilitators to implementation of multiple stroke guideline recommendations: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Translating evidence into practice is an important final step in the evidence-based practice process. Medical record audits can be used to examine how well practice compares to published evidence and identify gaps between evidence and practice. After providing audit feedback to practitioners, local barriers to practice change can be identified and addressed with targeted behavior change interventions. This study aimed to identify the barriers and factors that facilitate the implementation of multiple stroke guideline recommendations in an Australian stroke unit. METHODS: A qualitative methodology was used. A sample of 28 health, nursing and medicine professionals participated in a group or individual interview. These interviews occurred after staff received audit feedback and identified areas for practice change. Questions focused on barriers and facilitators to implementing guideline recommendations on the management of: upper extremity sensory impairments, mobility, including sitting balance; view; anxiety and depression; negligence; swallowing; communication; education for stroke survivors and caregivers; return-to-work advice and Qualitative data were analyzed by topic using theoretical domains described by Michie and colleagues (2005). RESULTS: Six group and two individual interviews were conducted, involving six disciplines. The barriers were different between disciplines. The six key barriers identified were: (1) Beliefs about the capabilities of individual professionals and their discipline, and about the capabilities of patients (2) Beliefs about the consequences, positive and negative, of implementing the recommendations (3) Memory and attention to best practices (4) Knowledge and skills required to implement best practices;"" (5) Intention and motivation to implement best practices, and (6) Resources. Some barriers were also facilitators for change. For example, therapists Occupational therapists required new knowledge and skills (a barrier), to better manage sensation impairments and neglect, while physical therapists generally knew how to implement best practice mobility rehabilitation (an enabler).CONCLUSIONS: Findings add to current knowledge on the barriers to change and the implementation of multiple recommendations of the g uies. Major challenges included sex education and screening for depression. Limited knowledge and skills were a common barrier. Knowledge about specific interventions was needed before implementation could begin and to maintain treatment fidelity. The provision of detailed online intervention manuals and protocols can help clinicians overcome the knowledge barrier.",0,0,
232,Barriers and facilitators associated with the use of non-surgical treatments for patients with osteoarthritis in orthopedic practice.,"INTRODUCTION: International evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip and knee recommend starting with (a combination of) non-surgical treatments, and using surgical intervention only if a patient does not respond sufficiently to treatment. non-surgical treatments. Treatment options. Despite these recommendations, there is strong evidence that non-surgical treatments are not optimally used in orthopedic practice. To improve the uptake of non-surgical treatments, more information is needed on the barriers and facilitators of these treatments. Therefore, this study evaluated what barriers and facilitators are associated with the use and prescription of different non-surgical treatments prior to hip and knee OA in orthopedic practice among patients and orthopedic surgeons in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted two Internet-based surveys among 172 orthopedic surgeons and 174 OA patients. Univariate association and multivariate regression techniques are used to identify barriers and facilitators associated with the use of nonsurgical treatments. RESULTS: Most barriers and facilitators among patients were associated with the use of physical therapy, lifestyle advice, and dietary therapy. Among orthopedic surgeons, the majority was associated with the prescription of paracetamol, dietary therapy and physical therapy. Examples of barriers and facilitators between patients included ""People close to me had positive experiences with surgery"" (OA education facilitator), and ""Advice from people close to me to keep moving"" (lifestyle advice facilitator and dietary). For orthopedic surgeons, examples were 'Lack of guideline knowledge' (barrier to lifestyle advice), 'Agreements/deliberations with primary care' and 'Easy communication with a dietician' (facilitators for dietary therapy) . Also the belief in the efficacy of these treatments was associated with a higher prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to improve the use of nonsurgical treatment in orthopedic practice should be directed at changing orthopedic surgeons' beliefs, communication with other OA care providers, and involvement of the patient's environment in the treatment of OA.

233,Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of VA home-based primary care on American Indian reservations: a qualitative multiple-case study.,"Background Veterans Health Affairs (VA) home-based primary care (HBPC) is an evidence-based, interdisciplinary approach to non-institutional long-term care that was developed in urban settings to provide longitudinal care for vulnerable older patients. Under the authority of a Memorandum of Understanding between the VA and the Indian Health Service (IHS) to improve access to health care, 14 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) independently initiated plans to expand HBPC programs to rural Indian reservations. Americans and 12 VAMCs successfully implemented programs. The purpose of this study is to describe the barriers and facilitators to implementation in rural Native communities with the goal of informing planners and policymakers for future program expansions. Methods A qualitative comparative case study approach was used, treating each of the 14 VAMCs as a case. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform an open-ended interview guide, telephone interviews (n = 37) were conducted with HBPC staff and clinicians, and local/regional managers, who participated in or supervised implementation . Interviews were transcribed, coded, and then analyzed using domains and CFIR constructs to describe and compare experiences and identify facilitators, barriers, and accommodations that emerged in common across the VAMC and HBPC programs. Results There was considerable variation in local contexts across VAMC. However, implementation was generally facilitated by key individuals who were able to build trust and faith in VA health care among Native American communities. The policy promoted clinical collaboration, but collaborations generally occurred on an ad hoc basis between VA and IHS physicians to optimize patient resources. All programs required some adaptations to address barriers in rural areas, such as distances, caseloads, or delays in hiring additional physicians. VA funding opportunities facilitated the expansion and maintenance of these programs. Conclusions Since program expansion is a responsibility of the HBPC program director, there is little sharing of lessons learned between VA facilities. Shared learning opportunities would benefit Federal health care organizations to expand other medical services to other American Indian and other rural and underserved communities, as well as to coordinate with other health care organizations. The CFIR framework was an effective analytical tool for comparing programs that address multiple internal and external environments.",0,0,
234,Obstacles and facilitators of evidence-based practice in perinatal care in the SEA-ORCHID project,"RATIONALE, GOALS, AND OBJECTIVES: The Southeast Asia Optimizing Reproductive and Child Health in Developing Countries (SEA-ORCHID) project aimed to improve maternal and infant health outcomes in nine hospitals in Southeast Asia by supporting evidence-based perinatal health care. . In this investigation, our objective was to identify and explore the factors that may have acted as barriers or facilitators of change in evidence-based practice in each of the hospitals. METHODS: During the last 6 months of the intervention phase of the project, semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 179 nurses, midwives, and physicians from the maternity and neonatal departments at each of the nine participating centers in Southeast Asia. hospitals RESULTS: Interviews identified several factors that participants believed had a substantial impact on the effectiveness of the SEA-ORCHID intervention. These included knowledge, skills, hierarchy, multidisciplinarity and leadership, beliefs about consequences, resources, and the nature of behaviors. The success of the SEA-ORCHID intervention in improving practice may reflect the extent to which the tailored strategies were effective in overcoming these barriers. CONCLUSION: Effective interventions to align practice with evidence are based on identifying and addressing barriers to practice change. The barriers identified in this study may be useful to those designing similar clinical practice improvement projects, as well as for ongoing practice improvement efforts at SEA-ORCHID hospitals.",0,0,
235,Barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening in underserved women in the District of Columbia,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening from the perspective of medically underserved women in the District of Columbia (DC) that may influence breast cancer screening intentions and cervix""; determine any relationship between attitudes and the influence of significant others on anticipated behaviors;"" and identify a relationship between the location where services are provided and the intentions of underserved women to engage in screening behaviors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlational. SETTING: Breast and cervical cancer screening clinics in DC. SAMPLE: 339 medically underserved adult women. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews conducted by researchers. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Demographic and contextual variables, as well as attitudes and influence of significant others. Intention to have a monthly mammogram or Pap smear or perform a breast self-examination (BSE). FINDINGS: The intention to have a mammogram was positively related to the influence of significant others and negatively related to the lack of attention from health professionals. Intention to have a Pap test was positively related to attitude toward the test and to the influence of significant others. Intention to perform BSE was positively related to attitude toward prior BSE performance and the influence of significant others. No significant relationships were observed between the intention to carry out screening behaviors and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Factors influencing women's attitudes toward screening and intention to engage in these behaviors include prior screening behaviors, influence of significant others, and relationships with health professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are well positioned to develop and test intervention strategies designed to increase access to and adherence to recommended screening guidelines among the medically underserved. The findings of this study could potentially guide the development and evaluation of such strategies that are sensitive to this special population.",0,0,
236,Barriers to the implementation of preconception care guidelines according to the perception of general practitioners: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence for the benefits of preconception interventions in improving pregnancy outcomes, delivery and uptake of preconception care and periconceptional folate supplementation remain low. General practitioners play a central role in providing preconception care. Understanding GPs' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to implementing preconception care allows for more appropriate targeting of quality improvement interventions. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the barriers and facilitators to the delivery and acceptance of preconception care guidelines from the perspective of general practitioners using theoretical domains related to behavior change. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups consisting of 22 general practitioners who were recruited from three regional general practice support organizations. The questions were based on the theoretical domain framework, which describes 12 domains related to behavior change. The responses of the general practitioners were classified into predefined themes using a deductive process of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Beliefs about abilities, motivations and goals, environmental context and resources, and memory, attention and decision making were the key domains identified in the barrier analysis. Some of the perceived barriers identified by general practitioners were time constraints, lack of women presenting preconception, numerous competing preventive priorities within the general practice setting, issues related to cost and access to preconception care, and lack of resources to assist in the delivery of preconception care guidelines. Perceived enablers identified by general practitioners included the availability of preconception care checklists and patient brochures, brochures, and waiting room posters describing the benefits and availability of preconception care consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified some of the barriers and facilitators to the delivery and acceptance of preconception care guidelines, as perceived by general practitioners. Relating these barriers to a domain theoretical framework provides a clearer understanding of some of the psychological aspects that are involved in the behavior of general practitioners towards the provision and acceptance of preconception care. Further research prioritizing these barriers and the theoretical domains to which they relate is needed before a methodologically rigorous intervention can be designed, implemented, and evaluated.",0,0,
237,Barriers to the use of breast cancer risk reduction therapies,"Evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the use of tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole for risk reduction of invasive breast cancer, predominantly estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Revised clinical guidelines now strongly recommend that doctors offer high-risk women drugs to reduce the risk of breast cancer. Although only a small portion of eligible women receive risk-reducing medications, evidence suggests greater uptake among women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Among clinicians, barriers to prescribing risk-reduction medications include inadequate training in risk assessment, lack of reimbursement for preventive advice, and lack of availability of easily accessible and easy-to-use predictive tools to estimate profiles. risk/benefit. Strategies to improve acceptance among women have focused on providing breast cancer risk education and information that accurately conveys the risks and benefits of risk-reducing medications. The priority areas of research that have been identified to improve the use of medications for risk reduction are (1) the development of risk assessment tools that more accurately identify women most likely to benefit, (2) the identification of circulating or tissue biomarkers that can predict and monitor treatment responsiveness, and (3) a better understanding of patient-related barriers, including patients' subjective beliefs and experiences.",0,0,
238,Baseline Depression Severity as a Moderator of Depression Outcomes Between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Pharmacotherapy: An Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis,"IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend treating severe depression with pharmacotherapy. Randomized clinical trials, as well as traditional meta-analyses, have considerable limitations in testing for moderators of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic literature search, collect primary trial data, and analyze baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication (ADM). DATA SOURCES: A total of 14,902 abstracts from a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to January 1, 2014 were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials in which compared CBT and WMD in Patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study authors were asked to provide primary data from their trial. Primary data from 16 of 24 identified trials (67%) with 1700 outpatients (794 in the CBT condition and 906 in the ADM condition) were included. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation methods. Mixed-effects models adjusting for study-level differences were used to examine severity of baseline depression as a moderator of treatment outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seventeen-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: There was a main effect of ADM over CBT in HAM-D (beta = -0.88""; P = .03) and a non-significant trend in BDI (beta = -1.14; P = .08, statistical test for trend), but there was no significant difference in response (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; P = .12) or remission (OR, 1.18; P = .22).Mixed-effects models using the HAM -D indicated that baseline depression severity did not show moderate reductions in depressive symptoms between CBT and ADM on outcome (beta = 0.00; P = .96).Similar results were seen using the BDI.Baseline depression severity it also did not moderate the likelihood of response (OR, 0.99; P = .77) or remission (OR, 1.00; ""P = .93) between CBT and ADM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline depression severity did not moderate differences between CBT and ADM in HAM-D or BDI or in response or remission. This finding cannot be extrapolated to other psychotherapies, to individual ADMs, or to hospitalized patients. However, it offers new and substantial evidence that is relevant to researchers, clinicians, therapists, and patients.",0,0,
239,Baseline characteristic of a randomized trial evaluating the effects of disease management programs for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke.,"BACKGROUND: Long-term, comprehensive patient education programs designed to improve self-management can help patients better manage their medical condition. We evaluated its influence on the prevention of stroke recurrence through disease management programs (DMP) created for each of the risk factors in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. METHODS: This is a randomized study conducted with patients with ischemic stroke within 1 year of its onset. Subjects in the intervention group received a 6-month WMD that included self-management education provided by a nurse along with support in collaboration with the primary care physician. Those in the usual care group received routine outpatient care. The primary endpoints are stroke recurrence and stroke death. Patients were enrolled for 2 years with plans for a 2-year follow-up after the 6-month education period (a total of 30 months). RESULTS: A total of 321 eligible subjects (mean age, 67.3 years; female, 96 [29.9%]), including 21 subjects (6.5%) with transient ischemic attack, were enrolled in this study. Regarding risk factors for stroke, 260 subjects (81.0%) had hypertension, 249 subjects (77.6%) had dyslipidemia, 102 subjects (31.8%) had diabetes mellitus, 47 subjects (14.6% ) had atrial fibrillation and 98 subjects (30.5%) had chronic kidney disease.There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to subject characteristics.CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized controlled trial that aimed to assess the effects of DMPs for secondary prevention of stroke.Follow-up on the subject is ongoing and will end in 2015.",0,0,
240,Befriending caregivers of people with dementia: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of a voluntary sector-based friendship scheme in improving the psychological well-being and quality of life of family caregivers of people with dementia. DESIGN Single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING Community settings in East Anglia and London. PARTICIPANTS 236 family caregivers of people with primary progressive dementia. INTERVENTION Contact with a befriender facilitator and offer of a match with a trained volunteer lay befriender compared to no befriender facilitator contact"";"" all participants continued to receive 'usual care'. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Carers' mood (hospital anxiety and depression scale-depression) and health-related quality of life (EuroQoL) at 15 months post randomisation. RESULTS The intention-to-treat analysis showed no benefit for the intervention 'access to a facilitator befriender' on the primary outcome measure or on any of the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Like many caregiver services, friendship schemes are not adopted by all caregivers, and providing access to a friendship scheme is not effective in improving well-being.

241,Behavior change without behavior change communication: promoting handwashing among primary school students in Bangladesh.,"Behavior change communication to improve handwashing with soap can be labor intensive and resource intensive, but quality results are difficult to achieve. Nudges are environmental cues that involve unconscious decision-making processes to drive behavior change. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed an inexpensive set of incentives to encourage handwashing with soap after using the toilet in two primary schools in rural Bangladesh. We completed direct observation of behaviors at baseline, after providing traditional handwashing infrastructure, and at various time periods after specific handwashing pushes (1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks). No additional handwashing education or motivational messages were completed. Handwashing with soap among school-age children was low at baseline (4%), increasing to 68% the day after pushovers were completed and to 74% at both 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the intervention. The results indicate that shove-based interventions have the potential to improve handwashing with soap among schoolchildren in Bangladesh and specific areas for further research are discussed.",0,1,
242,Behavioral counseling after screening for alcohol misuse in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"Background: Alcohol misuse, which includes the entire spectrum from hazardous drinking to alcohol dependence, is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Purpose: To assess the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescent and adult alcohol abusers. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and reference lists of published literature (January 1985 to January 2012, limited to articles in English). Study Selection: Controlled trials of at least 6 months' duration that enrolled screen-identified alcohol abusers in primary care settings and evaluated behavioral counseling interventions. Data extraction: one reviewer extracted data and a second checked for accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned quality ratings and rated the strength of the evidence. Data synthesis: The 23 included trials generally excluded people with alcohol dependence. The best evidence was for brief multi-contact interventions (10 to 15 minutes). Among adults who received behavioral interventions, consumption decreased by 3.6 drinks per week from baseline (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/week [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8 drinks/week] ""; 10 trials; 4,332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported episodes of heavy drinking (risk difference, 0.12 [CI, 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 trials; 2,737 participants), and a 11% more adults reported drinking less than the recommended limits (risk difference, 0.11 [CI, 0.08 to 0.13]; 9 trials;"" 5,973 participants) over 12 months compared with control participants ( moderate evidence). The evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about alcohol-related accidents, injuries, or liver problems. Trials involving young adults or college students showed reduced drinking and fewer binge drinking episodes (moderate strength of evidence). Little or no evidence of damage was found. Limitations: The results may be biased to zero because the behavior of the control participants could have been affected by the alcohol misuse assessments. Furthermore, the evidence may not be applicable to people with alcohol dependence and selective reporting may have occurred. Conclusion: Behavioral counseling interventions improve behavioral outcomes for adults with risky drinking. Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",0,0,

METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling. The review included studies that evaluated behavioral counseling interventions delivered in primary settings, those considered feasible in primary care, and those to which patients could be referred from primary care. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and adults. at increased risk of STIs.

244,Behavioral counseling to promote physical activity and a healthy diet to prevent cardiovascular disease in adults: a systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"Background: Poor diet and lack of physical activity can worsen cardiovascular health; however, most Americans do not meet the recommendations for diet and physical activity. Purpose: To assist the US Preventive Services Task Force with advice on preventing cardiovascular disease. Data sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2001 to January 2010), experts, and existing systematic reviews. a priori inclusion criteria and critically appraised each study using design-specific quality criteria. Data extraction and analysis: Data from 73 studies (109 articles) were abstracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for multiple intermediate health and behavior outcomes. Data Synthesis: Long-term observational follow-up of intensive sodium reduction counseling showed a decrease in the incidence of cardiovascular disease"";"" however, other direct evidence of reduced morbidity from the disease is lacking. High-intensity dietary advice, with or without physical activity advice, resulted in changes of 0.3 to 0.7 kg/m2 in body mass index (adiposity), 1.5 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.1 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure, ?0.7 mm Hg (CI, ?0.6 to ?0.9 mm Hg) in diastolic pressure, ?0.17 mmol/L ( CI, ?0.09 to ?0.25 mmol/L) (?6.56 mg/dL [CI, ?3.47 to ?9.65 mg/dL]) in total cholesterol level, and ?0 .13 mmol/L (CI, ?0.06 to ?0.21 mmol/L) (?5.02 mg/dL [CI, ?2.32 to ?8.11 mg/dL ]) at the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Medium and high intensity counseling resulted in moderate to large changes in self-reported dietary and physical activity behaviors. Limitations: Meta-analyses for some outcomes had high statistical heterogeneity or evidence of publication bias. Only 11 trials followed up on outcomes beyond 12 months. Conclusion: Advice to improve diet or increase physical activity changed health behaviors and was associated with small improvements in adiposity, blood pressure, and lipid levels.

246,Behavioral programs for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Background: Behavioral programs can improve outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but there is a wide diversity of behavioral interventions and uncertainty about how to optimize the effectiveness of these programs. Purpose: To identify factors that moderate the effectiveness of behavioral programs for adults with type 2 diabetes. Data sources: 6 databases (1993 to January 2015), conference proceedings (2011 to 2014), and reference lists. Study selection: Duplicate screening and selection of 132 randomized controlled trials evaluating behavioral programs compared with usual care, active controls, or other behavioral programs. Data extraction: one reviewer extracted and another checked the data. Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias. Data Synthesis: Behavioral programs were grouped on the basis of program content and delivery methods. A Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that most diabetes self-management and lifestyle education and support programs (typically offering 11 contact hours) led to clinically important improvements in glycemic control (reduced 0.4% in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ), while most diabetes self-management education programs without additional support, especially those offering 10 or fewer contact hours, provided little benefit. Programs with higher effect sizes were more often delivered in person than through technology. Lifestyle programs led to the largest reductions in body mass index. Reductions in HbA1c appeared to be greater for participants with a baseline HbA1c level of 7.0% or higher, adults younger than 65 years, and people of color (subgroups with 75% nonwhite participants). Limitations: All trials were at medium or high risk of bias. Subgroup analyzes were indirect and therefore exploratory. Most outcomes were reported immediately after the interventions. Conclusion: Diabetes self-management education offering 10 or fewer hours of contact with the delivery staff provided little benefit. Behavioral programs seem to benefit people with poor or suboptimal glycemic control more than those with good control. Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

247,Behavioral sexual risk reduction counseling in primary care to prevent sexually transmitted infections: a systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common and preventable. Purpose: To update a previous systematic review on the benefits and harms of sexual risk reduction counseling for STI prevention for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data sources: Selected databases from January 2007 to October 2013, handsearching reference lists and gray literature, and studies from the previous review. Study selection: English-language trials of fair or good quality conducted in adolescents or adults. Data extraction: one researcher extracted the data and a second verified the extraction. Study quality was double checked. Data synthesis: 31 trials were included: 16 (n = 56,110) were recently published and 15 (n = 14,214) were from the previous review. Most trials targeted people at increased risk of STIs based on sociodemographic characteristics, risky sexual behaviour, or history of an STI. High-intensity interventions (>2 hours) reduced the incidence of STIs in adolescents (odds ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60]) and adults (odds ratio, 0.70 [CI, 0.56 to 0.87]). Lower intensity interventions were generally not effective in adults, but some approaches showed promise. Although moderate intensity interventions may be effective in adolescents, data were very sparse. Reported behavioral outcomes were heterogeneous and most likely show benefit with high-intensity interventions at 6 months or less. We found no consistent evidence that sexual risk reduction counseling was harmful. Limitations: Low-risk populations and adolescent boys were underrepresented. The reliability of self-reported behavioral outcomes was unknown. Conclusion: High-intensity sexual risk reduction counseling can reduce STIs in primary care and related settings, especially in sexually active adolescents and adults at increased risk of STIs.

248,Behavioral therapy with or without biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation for persistent postprostatectomy incontinence,"Context Although behavioral therapy has been shown to improve postoperative recovery of continence, there have been no controlled trials of behavioral therapy for postprostatectomy incontinence persisting for more than 1 year. Objective To assess the efficacy of behavioral therapy in reducing persistent postprostatectomy incontinence and to determine whether pelvic floor electrical stimulation and biofeedback technologies improve the efficacy of behavioral therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective randomized controlled trial involving 208 community-dwelling men aged 51 to 84 years with persistent incontinence 1 to 17 years after radical prostatectomy was conducted at a university and 2 Continence Affairs clinics. Veterans Administration (2003-2008) and included a 1-year follow-up after active treatment. Twenty-four percent of the men were African American; 75% white. Interventions After stratification by type and frequency of incontinence, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 8 weeks of behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies); behavioral therapy plus dual-channel electromyograph biofeedback in office and daily pelvic floor electrical stimulation at home at 20 Hz, current up to 100 mA (additional behavior); or deferred treatment, which served as a control group. reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes after 8 weeks of treatment as documented in 7-day bladder diaries Results Mean number of incontinence episodes decreased from 28 to 13 per week (55% reduction; confidence interval [ 95% CI, 44%-66%) after behavioral therapy and 26 to 12 (51% reduction; 95% CI, 37%-65%) after behavioral therapy plus. Both reductions were significantly greater than the reduction from 25 to 21 (24% reduction; 95% CI, 10%-39%) or observed among controls (P = .001 for both treatment groups). However, there was no significant difference in incontinence reduction between the treatment groups (p = 0.69). Improvements were durable at 12 months in the active treatment groups: 50% reduction (95% CI, 39.8%-61.1%; 13.5 episodes per week) in the behavioral group and 59% reduction % (95% CI, 45.0%-73.1%; ""9.1 episodes per week) in the behavioral plus group (P = .32). Conclusions Among patients with postprostatectomy incontinence for at least 1 year , 8 weeks of behavioral therapy, compared with a late treatment control, resulted in fewer episodes of incontinence.The addition of biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation did not result in greater effectiveness.",0,0,
249,Behavioral treatment of obesity in patients cared for in primary care settings: a systematic review,"SIGNIFICANCE: In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved intensive behavioral weight loss counseling for approximately 14 face-to-face 10-15 minute sessions over 6 months for obese beneficiaries in primary care settings, when provided by physicians and other primary care professionals as defined by CMS. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of behavioral counseling for overweight and obese patients recruited from primary care, provided by primary care physicians working alone or with trained interventionists (eg, physician assistants, registered dietitians), or by trained interventionists who work independently. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and June 2014 that recruited overweight and obese primary care patients""; provided behavioral counseling (i.e., diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy ) for at least 3 months, with at least 6 months of follow-up after randomization; included at least 15 participants per treatment group and objectively measured weights;"" and had a comparator, an intention-to-treat analysis, and an attrition of less than 30% at one year or less than 40% at longer follow-up. FINDINGS: The review of 3304 abstracts yielded 12 trials, with 3893 participants, that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and pre-specified quality ratings. No studies were found in which primary care physicians provided advice that followed CMS guidelines. Mean weight changes at 6 months from baseline in the intervention groups ranged from a loss of 0.3 kg to 6.6 kg. In the control group, the mean change ranged from a gain of 0.9 kg to a loss of 2.0 kg. Weight loss in both groups generally decreased with longer follow-up (12 to 24 months). Interventions that prescribed both reduced energy intake (eg, >/= 500 kcal/d) and increased physical activity (eg, >/= 150 minutes per week of walking), with therapy traditional behavioral interventions generally produced greater weight loss than interventions without all 3 specific components. In earlier trials, more treatment sessions, conducted in person or over the phone by trained interventionists, were associated with greater average weight loss and the likelihood of patients losing 5% or more of their baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive behavioral counseling can induce clinically significant weight loss, but there is little research on primary care physicians providing such care. The present findings suggest that a range of trained interventionists, providing advice in person or by telephone, could be considered to treat overweight or obesity in patients in primary care settings.",0,0,
250,Behavior change strategies to reduce the burden of blood pressure-related illness: findings from a global implementation research program.,"BACKGROUND: The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases comprises most of the world's public research funding agencies. It focuses on implementation research to address the burden of chronic disease in low- and middle-income countries and among vulnerable populations in high-income countries. In its inaugural research call, 15 projects were funded, focused on reducing the burden of blood pressure-related disease. In this study, we describe a reflective mapping exercise to identify the behavior change strategies undertaken in each of these projects. METHODS: Using the Behavior Change Wheel framework, each team rated the capacity, timeliness, and motivation of the various actors that were integral to each project (eg, community members, non-medical health workers, and physicians). in projects focused on the provision of services). The teams then mapped the interventions they were implementing and determined the main policy categories in which those interventions operated. Guidance was provided on the use of the behavior change wheel to support consistency in responses across teams. The ratings were iteratively discussed and refined in several group meetings. RESULTS: There was a marked variation in the perceived capabilities, opportunities, and motivation of the various actors who were being targeted by behavior change strategies. Despite this variation, there was a high degree of synergy in intervention roles with most teams using complex interventions involving education, training, empowerment, environmental restructuring, and persuasion-oriented strategies. Similar policy categories also focused on all teams, particularly in the areas of guidelines, communication/marketing, and service provision, with few teams focusing on fiscal measures, regulation, and legislation. CONCLUSIONS: The wide variation in readiness to change behavior among the main actors in these projects suggests that the interventions themselves will be variably adopted, despite the similarity in the approaches taken. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in driving the success and failure of research programs. Upcoming outcome and process evaluations of each project will build on this exploratory work and provide further insight into factors that could influence scaling up intervention strategies.",0,0,

252,Beliefs and attitudes about breast cancer and screening practices among Arab women living in Qatar: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Despite rising breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, breast cancer screening (BCS) rates among women in Qatar remain low. Previous studies indicate a need to better understand the many complex beliefs, values, and attitudes that influence health-seeking behavior of Arab women for the development of culturally appropriate and effective intervention strategies to address breast cancer in the Middle East. . This study investigates BCS beliefs, attitudes, and practices of Arabic-speaking women in Qatar. METHODS: Between March 2011 and July 2011, a multicentre cross-sectional quantitative survey of 1,063 (response rate 87.5%) Qatari citizens and non-residents of Qatar who spoke Arabic, aged 35 years or older, was conducted in Qatar. plus. Associations between BCS beliefs and practice were estimated using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Participants who adhered to the BCS guidelines (BCS practice = Yes) were compared with those who did not (BCS practice = No). RESULTS: In addition to low levels of awareness and low rates of participation in BCS, a quarter of the participants said that their doctors told them about breast cancer and less than half of the women interviewed believed that breast cancer it can be prevented. Women who participated in BCS practice were more likely to have had a doctor talk to them about breast cancer, to believe they were in good or excellent health, that cancer was preventable, or that cancer might run in families. Most wanted to know if they had cancer and felt their health care needs were being met. The main reasons given for not planning BCS were lack of medical advice, fear and shame. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a variety of channels (health care providers, media, breast cancer survivors, community leaders) should be used to create culturally appropriate breast cancer intervention programs and increased cancer awareness. breast cancer, BCS and the benefits of early detection. of breast cancer. Employing these measures will reduce breast cancer mortality rates among Arabic-speaking women living in the State of Qatar.",0,0,
253,Beliefs about mammography among women presenting to the emergency department for non-urgent care,"INTRODUCTION: One in 8 American women will develop invasive breast cancer in her lifetime. Despite evidence that mammography is an effective method of early detection, certain vulnerable groups, such as those who use the emergency department as a medical home, do not adhere to mammography screening guidelines and experience disparate cancer mortality from mom The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in beliefs regarding mammography among women attending the emergency department for non-urgent care and ultimately develop interventions that promote mammography for this vulnerable population. METHODS: We explored the relationship between readiness to adopt mammography behavior and perceived barriers, benefits, and susceptibility by administering risk, benefit, and barrier scales to a sample of 110 women presenting to the emergency department. from a public hospital for non-urgent complaints or were sitting in the ED waiting room. We also collect sociodemographic information and preparation stage. RESULTS: Adherence to mammography was around 60%. Most of the women who did not meet the current guidelines were contemplators. Those who were not contemplating getting tested were significantly less likely to perceive themselves to be at risk for breast cancer. Women who had more barriers to mammography perceived less benefit from having a mammogram. African-American women perceived less benefit from having a mammogram. DISCUSSION: The promotion of mammography is appropriately placed in the emergency department waiting room given the suboptimal rate at which screening is performed in this population. Beliefs regarding mammography differ for women at various stages of mammography adoption and for minority women. Understanding these differences will allow intervention in this setting to be tailored to the population. ER nurses are an important and sometimes the only healthcare point of contact for patients who routinely visit the emergency department. As such, they have a valuable opportunity to provide cancer screening advocacy messages. It is critical that nurses in this setting understand the complexities of providing this information and the need to do so.",0,0,
254,Beneficial and detrimental effects of augmented feedback on the clinical-teaching performance of physicians,"PURPOSE: To assess whether clinical teaching skills could be improved by providing teachers with augmented feedback from students. METHOD: A 1994 randomized controlled trial included 42 attending physicians and 39 residents in the Department of Medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine who taught 110 students on medical ward rotations for one-month periods. Prior to teacher rotations, teachers in the intervention group received graphical, norm-referenced summaries of their teaching performance as rated by students. Midway through the month, teachers in the intervention group received student ratings augmented by individualized teaching effectiveness guidelines based on the Stanford Teacher Development Program framework. Linear models were used to analyze students' mean ratings on teaching behaviors at the middle and end of the month. Independent variables included performance ratings, intervention status, teacher status, teaching experience, and interactions with baseline ratings. RESULTS: Complex interactions with baseline performance were found for most teaching categories at mid-month and end-of-month. Teachers in the intervention group who had high baseline performance scores had higher student ratings than teachers in the control group with similar baseline scores; teachers in the intervention group who had low baseline performance scores were rated lower than teachers in the control group with comparable baseline scores. Residents who had medium or high baseline scores received a higher rating than treating physicians with comparable baseline scores;"" the performance of residents with low baseline scores was similar to that of treating physicians with comparable baseline scores. CONCLUSION: Benchmark performance is important to identify teachers most likely to benefit from increased student feedback Potential deterioration in teacher performance warrants a reconsideration of the distribution of student scores to teachers with performance scores low reference.",0,0,
255,Benefits and harms of pharmacological treatment for urinary incontinence in women,"Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) in women negatively affects quality of life. Purpose: To conduct a systematic review of the literature on medications for urge UI in women. DATA SOURCES: We searched for articles published from 1966 to November 2011 in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCIRUS, and Google Scholar. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported in English. Data Extraction: Outcome rates and risk of bias were extracted using a standardized form to pool absolute risk differences and calculate the number of attributable events per 1000 patients treated, with 95% CI. Data synthesis: 94 RCTs were eligible. Pooled analyzes showed that among drugs for emergency UI, per 1,000 women treated, continence was restored in 130 with fesoterodine (CI, 58 to 202), 85 with tolterodine (CI, 40 to 129), 114 with oxybutynin (CI, 64 to 163), 107 with solifenacin (CI, 58 to 156), and 114 with trospium (CI, 83 to 144). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects were 31 per 1000 treated with fesoterodine (CI, 10 to 56), 63 with oxybutynin (CI, 12 to 127), 18 with trospium (CI, 4 to 33), and 13 with solifenacin. (IQ, 1 to 26). Inconsistent study definitions of UI reduction and quality of life hampered evidence synthesis. Limitation: Evidence for improvements in quality of life and comparative effectiveness with medications was limited, and evidence for the effects of race, baseline severity of UI, and comorbid conditions on treatment success was insufficient. Conclusion: Overall, medications for urge UI showed a similar small benefit. Therapeutic options should consider the damage profile. Evidence on long-term adherence and safety of treatments is lacking. Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",0,0,
256,"Benzodiazepines, Opioids, and Driving: An Overview of Experimental Research","PROBLEMS: Road accidents contribute significantly to the total injury burden in Australia, and the risk of injury is associated with the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in the driver's blood. Increasingly, some of the most frequently detected drugs include prescription medications, the most notable being benzodiazepines and opioids. However, there is a paucity of experimental research on the effects of prescription psychoactive drugs on driving behaviour. FOCUS: This document provides an overview of experimental studies investigating the effects of prescribed doses of benzodiazepines and opioids on driving ability, and points to future directions for research. KEY FINDINGS: There is a growing body of epidemiological evidence linking the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines and opioids with an increased risk of accident. However, the current experimental literature remains unclear. Limitations of study methodologies have resulted in inconsistent findings. IMPLICATIONS: There is limited experimental evidence to inform policy and guidelines regarding fitness to drive for patients taking prescription benzodiazepines and opioids. CONCLUSION: More experimental research is required to elucidate the effects of these medications on driving, under various conditions and in different medical settings. This will ensure that physicians who prescribe benzodiazepines and opioids are well informed and can properly advise patients on the risks associated with driving while taking these medications.",0,0,

258,Best practices in the management of primary nocturnal enuresis in children: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary loss of urine at night in a child of an age and physical health where dryness would be expected. The prevalence of this condition in Australia has been estimated at 18.9% in children aged 5 to 12 years, with up to 19% of boys and 16% of girls aged 5 years wetting the bed at least once a month. Until the age of 13, bedwetting is more common in boys and more common in girls after this age. Nocturnal enuresis has a spontaneous cure rate of approximately 14%; however, up to 3% of children remain enuretic into adulthood. Although this condition is pathologically benign, it can have serious social and psychological repercussions for the sufferer, including effects on self-esteem, school success, parental disapproval, and even sexual activity in adulthood. Despite the volume of information available for the management of bedwetting, most of the research has been conducted outside of Australia. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to produce management guidelines for nocturnal enuresis in children specific to Australian clinical practice. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered systematic reviews or concurrent controlled trials (randomized controlled trials [RCTs], pseudorandomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials [CCTs], interrupted time series [ITS], and controlled before-and-after trials [CBA]), to examine the effectiveness of interventions to control nocturnal enuresis in children aged up to 16 years. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all available evidence. We searched Cochrane and other health technology assessment websites for existing systematic reviews. Pubmed, Embase and CINAHL databases were searched for recent randomized controlled trials and controlled trials (1990 to 2007). Reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched for relevant trials. These reviews and guidelines were summarized and presented to an advisory panel of continence advisory nurses and clinicians to ensure relevance to Australian clinical practice. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of all studies using the JBI critical appraisal forms for experimental studies located within the JBI-MAStARI software. This tool was used to identify all sources of bias. Where there was disagreement between the two reviewers, a third reviewer resolved. RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews, eight new trials, and two guidelines were used in the development of these guidelines. Briefly, management recommendations include: CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of nocturnal enuresis and the negative psychosocial sequelae that can arise from this condition, management is both available and effective. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The practice of managing nocturnal enuresis in children should begin by addressing both daytime enuresis and any evidence of constipation. After this, less invasive behavioral therapies should be tried. If these measures fail, the use of alarms with or without short-term administration of desmopressin could be tried. Other interventions have not yet been shown to be definitively effective and should be considered with caution. However, it must be emphasized that the vast majority of children will become continent at some point in the future, with or without the benefit of interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: While it is clear that some behavioral approaches, alarms, and desmopressin may be effective interventions, the evidence for other treatments is less conclusive. However, the observation that even alarms and/or desmopressin do not work for all children suggests that research to establish the effectiveness of other interventions (especially behavioral and adjunctive treatments) should be conducted in the form of large, carefully designed RCTs. .",0,0,
259,Best strategies for implementing clinical pathways in an emergency department: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background The clinical pathway is a tool that operationalizes best evidence recommendations and clinical practice guidelines in an accessible format for point-of-care management by multidisciplinary health teams in hospital settings. While high-quality, expertly developed clinical pathways have many potential benefits, their impact has been limited by variable implementation strategies and suboptimal research designs. The best strategies for implementing pathways in hospital settings are still unknown. This study will seek to comprehensively develop and evaluate the best strategies for effective local implementation of externally developed expert clinical pathways. Design/Methods We will develop a theory-based, user-informed intervention strategy to implement two pediatric clinical pathways: asthma and gastroenteritis. Using a balanced incomplete block design, we will randomize 16 community emergency departments to receive the intervention for one clinical pathway and serve as a control for the alternative clinical pathway, thus conducting two cluster-randomized controlled trials to evaluate this implementation intervention. A minimization procedure will be used to randomize the sites. Intervention sites will receive a tailored strategy to support full implementation of the clinical pathway. We will assess the effectiveness of the implementation strategy through measurement of relevant process and clinical outcomes. The main result of the process will be the presence of a properly completed clinical pathway in the file for the relevant patients. The primary clinical outcomes for each clinical pathway include the following: Asthma, the proportion of patients with asthma adequately treated with corticosteroids in the emergency department and at discharge"";"" and GastroenteritisÂ¡Âªthe proportion of relevant patients treated appropriately with oral rehydration therapy. Data sources include chart audits, administrative databases, environmental scans, and qualitative interviews. We will also conduct an overall process assessment to assess the implementation strategy and an economic analysis to assess the costs and benefits of implementation. Discussion This study will contribute to the body of evidence supporting effective strategies for implementation of clinical pathways and ultimately narrowing research to practice gaps in putting best evidence care recommendations into practice through effective use of pathways. clinics.",0,0,
260,Intervention of best practices for the care of clients who self-mutilate,"PURPOSE: To describe the development of a best practice intervention to guide nurse practitioners (NPs) caring for people who self-mutilate. DATA SOURCES: The evidence on which the guideline was based includes six descriptive studies and expert clinical opinion articles. The framework for guideline development is a systematic process for obtaining and analyzing the best available evidence, developing a theory-based intervention, and proposing a system for ongoing evaluation of intervention effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The guide is an information sheet, which contains the definition of self-mutilation, background of the problem, affected target population and intervention. The three components of the intervention are (a) the NP's self-assessment of values, beliefs, and assumptions about people who self-harm""; (b) a focused and in-depth client assessment""; and (c) therapeutic strategies to address the emotional, social, and biological dimensions of self-mutilation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This Best Practices Intervention for the Care of Self-Harming Clients guide provides guidance for NPs to effectively address preventable self-harm behavior. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of guideline use and intervention.",0,0,
261,Best medicine by default,"Bottom. American health care is transitioning to electronic medical ordering. These computerized systems are unique in that they allow for custom ordering interfaces. While these systems provide great benefits, there are also potential drawbacks, as behavioral science has shown that the very format of electronic interfaces can influence decision making. Current research specifically examines how default values in electronic ordering templates affect physician treatment decisions and medical errors. Methods. Forty-five resident physicians completed order sets for 3 medical case studies. Participants were randomly assigned to receive sets of orders with 'opt-in' defaults (options visible but not selected) or 'opt-out' defaults (options visible and pre-selected). The results compare error rates across conditions and examine the type and severity of errors that are most often made with the default include and exclude values. Results. The exclusion defaults resulted in a higher number of ordered items and specifically an increase in commission errors (overorders) compared to the participation defaults. However, while subscription defaults resulted in fewer orders, errors of omission also increased. When the severity of the bugs is taken into account, the default effects appear to be limited to less severe bugs. Conclusion. Defaults used in electronic order sets influence medical treatment decisions when the consequences to a patient's health are low. This pattern suggests that clinicians cognitively override incorrect defaults, but only up to a point, and involves trade-offs that maximize accuracy and minimize cognitive effort. The results indicate that the default values for low-impact items in electronic templates deserve careful attention because they are unlikely to be overridden by clinicians.",1,1,
262,Best practices in collaborative mental health care: an analysis of the evidence base,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the experimental literature to identify best practices in collaborative mental health care in the primary care setting. METHODS: A review of the Canadian and international literature using Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other databases produced more than 900 related reports, of which 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. A systematic review and descriptive analysis is presented, with key conclusions and best practices. RESULTS: Successful collaboration requires preparation, time, and support structures, building on pre-existing clinical relationships. Collaborative practice is likely to develop more when clinicians are co-located and is more effective when the location is familiar and non-stigmatizing to patients. The degree of collaboration does not seem to predict clinical outcome. Enhanced collaboration combined with treatment guidelines or protocols offers important benefits over either intervention alone in major depression. Systematic follow-up was a powerful predictor of a positive outcome in collaborative care for depression. A clear relationship between collaborative efforts to increase medication adherence and clinical outcomes was not evident. Collaboration alone has not been shown to result in skill transfer in PCP knowledge or behaviors in the treatment of depression. A service restructuring designed to support changes in practice patterns of primary health care providers is also required. Improved patient education was part of many successful studies. The education was usually provided by someone other than the PCP. Collaborative interventions that are part of a research protocol can be difficult to sustain in the long term without ongoing funding. Consumer choice of treatment modality may be important in treatment participation in collaborative care (for example, having the option to choose psychotherapy versus medication). CONCLUSIONS: There is now a body of experimental literature evaluating the impact of increased collaboration on patient outcomes, primarily in depressive disorders. Best practices in collaborative mental health care are beginning to emerge.",0,0,
263,Between collegiate conversation and controlled trials: hospital neurologists' sources of information and their practical knowledge in treating stroke patients,"The application of standardized and evidence-based knowledge is an important foundation for coordinated and effective clinical work. A multicentre study, conducted in 30 clinical neurology departments and including 99 junior and senior registrars, addressed aspects of stroke management practice knowledge using open-ended structured oral interviews that were analyzed with respect to inter-physician agreement and with the guides. In addition, participants were asked to rate the usefulness of various information sources and to describe the information sources used according to the aspects of practical knowledge addressed. The respective departmental directors were questioned about the sources of medical knowledge accessible in their clinic. In almost all hospitals, doctors had access to a library and the Internet. However, the departments differed with respect to their information management (frequency and type of medical education, quality management, participation in research activities). Consistent with other studies, the most frequently reported sources of knowledge were textbooks, journals, and clinical studies. For most sources, usefulness ratings largely corresponded to user behavior ratings. Both were only weak predictors for guideline and interpractice compliance. They are more closely related to the homogeneity of practical knowledge within the department than to interdepartmental conformity and guidelines. Homogeneity within the department is enhanced by the use of recent, published, evidence-based sources and topical interaction with clinical colleagues. Compliance with the guideline was related to the use of databases and professional journals. Preference for outpatient practice colleagues decreased both inter-physician and guideline compliance. It appears that there is still untapped potential for knowledge management within the department, such as medical education, implementation and use of guidelines, and thematic discussions, which can improve homogeneity and conformance to practice knowledge guidelines applied by physicians. doctors.",0,0,
264,Between control and therapy: an analysis of the evolutionary concept of special observation in acute psychiatric wards,"OBJECTIVE: Special observation is a seriously invasive and resource-intensive intervention. It is necessary to scientifically conceptualize this measure for future research and practice. METHODS: Evolutionary concept analysis. RESULTS: The identified antecedents, attributes and consequences of the special observation oscillate between control and therapy as well as patient safety and professional coverage. The antecedents are made up of legitimation (indication, evaluation, prescription), resources (internal guidelines, architectural structures, information) as well as contextual factors (security needs, personal attitudes). The attitudes identified are the organization (qualification, change of caregivers, duration, place), the intervention (relationship, reassessment, transparency) as well as the field of tension between control and therapy. Consequences consist of side effects (patients, nurses, resources) and conflicts (ethical dilemmas, role conflicts). CONCLUSION: Society and discipline have influenced the concept over time and a distinction between the custody and control pattern versus a therapeutic approach is recommended.",0,0,
265,Between scientific application and therapy: ethical consideration,"The development of bioscience and biotechnology during the last thirty years exerted a tremendous influence on medicine. New techniques have emerged and new types of treatment have been and continue to be introduced. Theories about the pathogenesis and causes of the disease change, while new therapeutic drugs are constantly available on the market. The way new technologies and drugs are introduced increasingly contains an experimental phase in which animals and humans are used to test the results of the research. As a rule, these experiments are performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, Helsinki 1964, Tokyo, 1975). The guidelines in this Statement address the ethical aspects of experiments involving human subjects. Although the guidelines are intended to be of global importance, it remains a fact that some of them are the subject of debate in various regions of the world. They seem to have a cultural background (eg respect for the individual) and bioscientists sometimes argue that for this reason they should be considered unscientific constraints. Based on a general philosophical and ethical consideration, it will be argued in this article that ethical guidelines belong to the very heart of biomedicine and biology. It is in the common interest of researchers, clinicians, patients, and scientists to consider the ethical implications of research results before any valuable knowledge can be claimed to have been obtained. The implementation of monoclonal antibodies in clinical practice can be seen as an example of this argument.",0,0,
266,Beyond Domestic Violence Screening: A Systems Model Approach in a Managed Care Setting,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of domestic violence screening guidelines has been challenging. The multifaceted ""systems model"" can provide an effective means of improving the detection, identification, and intervention of domestic violence in the health care setting. METHODS: We developed: (1) a systems model approach using tools for effective ""domestic violence referral, assessment, and reporting""; (2) materials to distribute to female patients; (3) training for social and medical health services to provide domestic violence screening and (4) strong community ties SETTING: A nonprofit managed care facility in Richmond, California PARTICIPANTS: Managed care plan staff and members KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Increased of domestic violence screening by physicians; (2) increased awareness of the health care facility as a resource for domestic violence assistance;"" and (3) increased member satisfaction with the health plan's efforts to address domestic violence. RESULTS: The number of physician referrals and patient self-referrals to an on-site domestic violence evaluator more than doubled. A pre- and post-intervention telephone survey of members seen for a routine checkup showed an increase in member recall of being asked about domestic violence. After the intervention, statistically significant increases were observed in members' perception that the health plan was concerned about the effects of domestic violence on health (p<0.0001) and in members' satisfaction with health plans. health plan efforts to address this problem (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A systems model approach improved domestic violence services in a managed care health setting within 1 year and affected physician behavior as well as health plan member experience. This successful implementation makes it possible to address critical research questions about the impact of a health care intervention for victims of domestic violence in a managed care setting.",0,0,
267,Big pharmaceuticals and health: insoluble conflict of interest between private companies and public health,"landmark article on game theory showed that individual profit maximization necessarily endangers the public good, and since the problem has no technical solution, ""it requires a fundamental extension in morality"" (1). We propose here that public health, as a public good, now emerges as a serious example of this problem. Recent events and reports increasingly suggest a misalignment between the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and those of public health. Johnson & Johnson illegally and effectively promoted off-label Propulsid for children despite internal company documents raising safety concerns. Death in a drug trial has been described as a ""trade secret"". Of Vioxx, Topol wrote: ""Unfortunately, it is clear that Merck's commercial interest outweighed their concerns about the drug's toxicity"" (2). Academics and leading journal publishers are increasingly raising concerns about the type and quality of published evidence, often biased towards the efficacy of new products. The industry, which funds more than 80% of trials, sets a research agenda driven more by marketing than clinical considerations. Smart statistical and epidemiological tactics help to get the desired results. The budget for marketing is much higher than for research. Mass advertising directed at doctors and the public is becoming increasingly sophisticated: ghost writing, professional guidelines, targeting consumer groups, and manipulating the media to promote disease. Widespread lobbying and political ties limit the independence of regulators. The obligation to shareholders above public health considerations is not exclusive to the pharmaceutical industry. The chemical, tobacco, and food industries share similar tactics: proclaiming doubts about safety issues, buying researchers, infiltrating universities, boards, the media, and legislative agencies. By contrast, powerful and cheap health promotion activities, which are not supported by industry because they are too cheap and unpatented, are markedly underused: technologies to change behavior (for example, cardiac rehabilitation), palliative care and use of old, effective and safe medicines. everyone could benefit from the quality and marketing tools of the industry. Since the sick, the poor and the least educated are the most affected, the successes of the free market seem to pose intractable challenges to social justice in public health.",0,0,
268,Binge eating disorder in adults: systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The best treatment options for binge eating disorder are unclear. PURPOSE: To summarize the evidence on the benefits and harms of psychological and pharmacological therapies for adults with binge eating disorder. DATA SOURCES: English-language publications in EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Academic OneFile, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov through November 18, 2015, and in MEDLINE through May 12, 2016. STUDY SELECTION: 9 controlled psychological trials in waiting list and 25 placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological (n = 19) or combined (n = 6) treatment. All were randomized trials with low or medium risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted trial data, assessed risk of bias, and rated strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapist-directed cognitive behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, and second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) decreased binge-eating frequency and increased binge-eating abstinence (relative risk, 4.95 [95% CI, 3.06 to 8.00 ], 2.61 [CI, 2.04 to 3.33], and 1.67 [CI, 1.24 to 2.26], respectively). Lisdexamfetamine (mean difference [MD], -6.50 [CI, -8.82 to -4.18]) and SGA (MD, -3.84 [CI, -6.55 to -1.13] ]) reduced binge-eating obsessions and compulsions, and SGAs reduced symptoms of depression (MD, -1.97 [CI, -3.67 to -0.28]). Headache, gastrointestinal upset, sleep disturbance, and sympathetic nervous system arousal occurred more frequently with lisdexamfetamine than with placebo (relative risk range, 1.63 to 4.28). Other forms of cognitive behavioral therapy and topiramate also increased abstinence and reduced binge frequency and related psychopathology. Topiramate reduced weight and increased sympathetic nervous system arousal, and lisdexamfetamine reduced weight and appetite. LIMITATIONS: The majority of study participants were overweight or obese white women between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Many treatments were examined only in single studies. Outcomes were inconsistently measured across trials and were rarely assessed beyond the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, SGA, and topiramate reduced binge eating and related psychopathology, and lisdexamfetamine and topiramate reduced weight in adults with binge eating disorder.",0,0,
269,Biomedical and behavioral research in nursing homes: guidelines for ethical research,"As nursing homes become increasingly important sites for biomedical and behavioral research, researchers must address the ethical issues of increased vulnerability and the high prevalence of mental and physical disorders in the nursing home population. Obtaining valid informed consent is only one of many difficult problems facing the nursing home investigator. Efforts should be made to involve nursing home residents, as well as family and staff members, in reviewing the research. The benefits and burdens of research protocols must be equitably distributed, and potential conflicts of interest for staff members and clinicians must be minimized or their potential adverse impact enhanced. Proper attention to these ethical concerns can facilitate nursing home research while protecting vulnerable residents. We offer proposed guidelines for the ethical conduct of nursing home research in an effort to stimulate discussion among researchers, nursing home staff and residents, families of residents, and ethicists.",0,0,
270,Pennsylvania Resident Bipolar Disorder Center: Implementing an Efficacy Trial to Improve Treatment of At-Risk Patients,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescents, older adults, African Americans, and rural residents with bipolar disorder are less likely than their middle-aged, white, urban counterparts to be diagnosed, receive appropriate treatment, remain in treatment once identified, and have positive outcomes . The Bipolar Disorder Center for Pennsylvania Residents (BDCP) study was designed to address these disparities. This report highlights the methods used to recruit, test, and enroll a difficult-to-recruit cohort of people with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Study sites included three specialized clinics for bipolar disorder in a university setting and one rural behavioral health clinic. Study operations were standardized and all study personnel received training in study procedures. Various strategies were used for recruitment. RESULTS: It was possible to introduce the identical assessment and screening protocol in settings regardless of whether they had a history of implementing research protocols. This protocol could also be used across the age spectrum, in urban and rural areas, and in a racially diverse cohort of participants. Across the four sites, 515 people with bipolar disorder were enrolled as a result of these methods (69 African Americans and 446 non-African Americans). Although clinical characteristics at study entry did not differ appreciably between African Americans and non-African Americans, treatment pathways differed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous recruitment and screening procedures can be successfully introduced in different settings and with different patient cohorts, facilitating access to high-quality treatment for people who frequently do not receive adequate care for bipolar disorder.",0,0,
271,Books and Reading: An Evidence-Based Standard of Care Whose Time Has Come,"Reach Out and Read (ROR) is the only systematically evaluated clinical activity to promote child development in primary care used in the United States. The ROR intervention is simple: clinicians provide counseling on the benefits of reading aloud, as well as deliver books directly to high-risk children and parents to take home at each pediatric visit for children 6 months to 5 years. ROR is based on a significant evidence base for the value of reading aloud to young children. Studies evaluating ROR from different sites of subjects from different racial backgrounds and numerous outcome measures are consistently positive. From its initial single site at Boston City Hospital in 1989, to more than 4,600 clinical sites in 2010, more than 30,000 physicians distributed more than 6.2 million books a year to 3.9 million children across the United States. Future efforts for ROR include integrating mental health competencies found in the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines as part of residency and clinical training in the ROR paradigm, quality improvement to ensure fidelity to intervention and expanded participation of pediatric physicians in local early childhood and school readiness. community efforts. Finally, the most important future goal is the adoption of advice on reading aloud and delivery of developmentally appropriate books to high-risk families as best practices by official bodies.",0,0,
272,Borderline personality disorder in adolescence,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common and serious mental disorder that is associated with severe functional impairment and a high rate of suicide. BPD is generally associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, a high burden on families and caregivers, ongoing resource utilization, and high treatment costs. BPD has been a controversial diagnosis in adolescents, but it is no longer warranted. Recent evidence demonstrates that BPD is as reliable and valid among adolescents as it is in adults, and that adolescents with BPD may benefit from early intervention. Consequently, adolescent BPD is now recognized in psychiatric classification systems and national treatment guidelines. This review aims to inform professionals in the field of adolescent health about the nature of BPD in adolescence and the benefits of early detection and intervention. The diagnosis and treatment of BPD should be considered part of routine practice in adolescent mental health to improve the well-being and long-term prognosis of these individuals.",0,0,

274,Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Although we have international and several national guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this article, we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and outstanding questions regarding the use of asthma guidelines, particularly in primary care. DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and precise. However, current evidence-based guidelines are predominantly written from the perspective of the patient with a clear diagnosis of asthma and tend not to consider the heterogeneity of asthma or accommodate individual patient variations in response to treatment or needs, differences in practice settings; or local differences in the availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials, which are designed to establish the efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions, may not apply to ""real world"" clinical practice, where patients are not selected, follow-up is less frequent, and effectiveness, the benefit of the treatment in routine clinical practice--is the most relevant result. Furthermore, most guidelines view asthma in isolation rather than consider other factors that may affect asthma and response to asthma treatment, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. . When these links are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these settings. Finally, there is some evidence that GPs are not convinced about the applicability of asthma guidelines in their practice settings, especially when guideline writers work primarily in specialist practice. CONCLUSION: The development of country-specific guidelines or, ideally, local guidelines could provide more practical solutions for asthma care and could take into account regional factors that influence patient choice and adherence to therapy. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational trials, in addition to randomized controlled trials, are needed to assess the real-world effectiveness of therapies, and guideline writers should also consider such evidence. Ultimately, practical tools are needed to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, poor adherence, and smoking, to complement treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines. for asthma.",0,0,
275,"Breast Cancer Screening Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors Among African American Women: The Black Female Cosmetologists' Health Promotion Program","BACKGROUND: African-American women have higher rates of breast cancer mortality than their white counterparts. Studies have suggested that this is due in part to the discovery of cancer at a later stage, highlighting the importance of encouraging early detection of breast cancer in this population. To guide the development of a breast cancer education intervention and help focus the health promotion efforts of other health educators and clinicians, this study explored whether a cohort of African American women living in San Diego would demonstrate possession adequate basic knowledge about breast cancer screening. and adherence to widely recommended screening guidelines. METHODS: African-American women (N = 1055) from San Diego, California, participated in a beauty salon survey of breast cancer screening knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The women's ages ranged from 20 to 94 years, with a mean age of 42.20 (SD = 13.53) years. Thirty-four percent reported completing college and/or some graduate training, and 52% reported having some formal college or post-secondary training. Seventy-five percent of the sample reported working outside of their home. Participating cosmetologists and their salons were recruited for the study through word of mouth recommendations from highly respected African-American community leaders. RESULTS: Salon clients reported low rates of compliance with recommended guidelines for breast cancer screening. Of the 1,055 participants, 31% reported performing a breast self-exam every month. Of participants age 40 and older, 57% reported having had a clinical breast exam and 43% reported having had a mammogram in the past year. Knowledge of breast cancer was associated with adherence to screening guidelines. While women recognized the serious health threat posed by breast cancer and that early detection of breast cancer is important, only 30% of women reported feeling well informed about the disease. Many participants demonstrated a lack of basic knowledge about breast cancer. The health belief model posits that access to such information is an essential element in the progression toward engaging in screening behaviors. CONCLUSION: The data from this study reflect a continuing need for increased breast cancer education for African-American women. In light of the considerable general information available related to breast cancer, these data reinforce the need for more breast cancer education programs that are clearly intended to attract the attention of African-American women.",0,0,

The UK audit shows low implementation rates. Interventions to improve this have had minimal effects. Quality improvement programs could be further developed by using theoretical frameworks (Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)) to modify existing interventions by identifying influences on clinical behavior and selecting appropriate content. The objective of this study was to illustrate the use of this process to modify an intervention designed with plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles that had achieved partial success in improving the implementation of Sepsis Six in a hospital.

This study examines the large-scale implementation of the National Multidisciplinary Guideline for Schizophrenia in the Netherlands. DESIGN: /st> Observational, prospective, repeated measurement study. SETTING: Thirty mental health teams in different regions of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine physicians with different professional backgrounds and 1489 patients with schizophrenia. INTERVENTION(S): Six evidence-based interventions for schizophrenia were implemented in the context of a quality improvement collaboration: assertive community treatment (ACT) or its adapted version functional assertive community treatment (FACT), cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, family interventions, support for individual placement and pharmacotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Professional performance, social functioning, and relapse rates. RESULTS: Improvement of professional performance, in line with the guidelines. The availability of (F)ACT improved from 23% to 60%. Individual placement support improved from 20% to 53%.

279,Brief physician-initiated smoking cessation strategies for clinical oncology settings: a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,"PURPOSE: Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, decreases the effectiveness of treatment, and worsens quality of life, about one-third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated. METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry. RESULTS: At 6-month follow-up, there were no significant differences in dropout rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there were no significant differences between the care groups. usual (13.6%) and intervention groups (13.3%) at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, started smoking after age 16 years, reported at baseline using a self-help quit guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed a greater basic desire to quit smoking. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group quit program, and had a greater initial desire to quit to smoke. Finally, there was greater adherence among clinicians to the NIH model for medical treatment of smoking cessation for patients in the intervention group versus the usual care group. CONCLUSION: Although training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients may improve physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, medical smoking cessation interventions do not achieve significant gains in smoking cessation rates. long-term smoking cessation among cancer patients.",0,0,

281,Capacity building for antiretroviral administration in South Africa: a qualitative evaluation of the PALSA PLUS nurse education programme.,"BACKGROUND: South Africa recently launched a national antiretroviral treatment programme. This has created an urgent need for training of nurses in the administration of antiretroviral treatment (ART). The PALSA PLUS program provides guidance and training for primary health care (PHC) nurses in the management of adult lung disease and HIV/AIDS, including ART. A process evaluation was conducted to document the training, explore perceptions of the value of the training, and compare the PALSA PLUS training approach (used at intervention sites) with the provincial training model. The evaluation was conducted in conjunction with a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of PALSA PLUS nurse education (Trial Reference Number ISRCTN24820584). METHODS: Qualitative methods were used, including participant observation of training sessions, focus group discussions, and interviews. Data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Nurse participation in PALSA PLUS training, regarding not only the specific components of ART but also lung health, was high. On-site ongoing training for all APS nurses, as opposed to the one-time centralized training provided to ART nurses only at non-intervention clinics, enhanced the support nurses' experience of their work by enabling, not only continuous experiential learning, supervision and emotional support, but also for continuous managerial review of all those changes at the system and infrastructure level necessary to facilitate the change of behavior of the health provider and the implementation of the guidelines. Training of all primary care nurses in the use of the PALSA PLUS guideline, as opposed to ART nurses only, was also perceived to better facilitate the integration of AIDS care within the clinical context. CONCLUSION: The PALSA PLUS training successfully engaged all PHC nurses in a comprehensive approach to a variety of illnesses affecting both HIV positive and negative patients. Training primary health care nurses for integrated systems-based interventions should be high on the ART funding agenda. However, behavior change training for individual providers is only one aspect of ongoing system-wide interventions needed to achieve lasting improvements in patient care in the context of an overburdened and underresourced PHC system. .",0,0,
282,Clinical Networking: A Developmental Assessment Framework,"Background Clinical networks have been designed as an interinstitutional mechanism for planning and delivering health services. With recent concerns about the effectiveness of these structures, it is timely to consider an evidence-based approach to how they can be developed and evaluated. Objective To document an evaluation framework for clinical networks based on the network evaluation literature and a 5-year study of clinical networks. Method We searched the literature in three domains: network evaluation, factors that help or inhibit network development, and robust methods for measuring network characteristics. This material was used to build a framework required for effective developmental assessment. Results The architecture of the framework identifies three stages of clinical network development"";"" partner selection, network design and network management. Within each stage there is evidence on the factors that act as facilitators and barriers to network growth. These factors can be used to measure progress through appropriate methods and tools. The framework can enable network growth and support informed decisions about progress. Conclusions For the first time in one place, a framework that incorporates rigorous methods and tools can identify factors that affect the development of clinical networks. The target user group is internal stakeholders who need to conduct a development assessment to inform key decisions along their network development journey.",0,0,
283,Construction of state infrastructure for the academic support of students with mild traumatic brain injury,"GOALS: Focus attention on building state capacity to support students with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/concussion. METHOD: Consensus-building process with a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and staff from the state Department of Education. RESULTS: The white paper presents the group's consensus on the essential components of a state educational infrastructure to support the management of students with mTBI. The nature and recovery process of mTBI is briefly described specifically with respect to its effects on learning and school performance. State and local policy considerations are then emphasized to promote the implementation of a consistent process. Five key components to building a statewide infrastructure for students with mTBI are outlined, including (1) definition and training of the school interdisciplinary team, (2) professional development of the school and medical communities, (3) protocols for identification, assessment, and monitoring of progress, (4) a flexible set of intervention strategies to adapt to the recovery needs of students and (5) systematized protocols for active communication between members of the medical, school and family team. The need for research to guide effective program implementation is emphasized. CONCLUSION: This guidance framework strives to assist in the development of support structures for recovering students with mTBI to optimize academic outcomes. Until more evidence is available on academic accommodations and other school supports, education systems should follow current best practice guidelines.",0,0,
284,"Building Trust: The History and Ongoing Relationships Between DSD Clinicians, Researchers, and Patient Advocacy Groups","People born with differences or disorders of sexual development (DSD) have been marginalized by society and the health system. Standards of care in the mid-20th century were based on ""fixing the child with a DSD, using hormonal and surgical interventions""; these treatments and diagnoses were almost never revealed to the child, and sometimes were not revealed to the child's parents. This led to secrecy, shame and stigma.When these children became adults and demanded access to their medical records, the realization of the depth of the secrecy led to the formation of activism groups that shook the medical community. From poor beginnings, advocates, health professionals, and researchers were able to bring about changes in the standard of care.The 2006 Consensus Statement on the Management of Intersex Disorders called for a multidisciplinary approach to care and questioned the evidence of many of the standard procedures The standard of care moved from a hide-and-seek model to a patient-centered paradigm, and agencies Funding Plans allocate resources to determine future directions for DSD research. the need to address patient priorities led to changes in international standards to include patients in research design. Some challenges that remain include: the Institute of Medicine's findings that sexual and gender minorities experience poor health outcomes; establish trust between all parties""; develop a common language and create places where people can engage in dialogue that addresses personal experiences, research design, clinical practices and intervention strategies.",0,0,

287,Can a rural community-based work-related activities program make a difference for injured workers disabled by chronic pain?,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a guideline-informed multidisciplinary program of work-related activities in improving the physical, psychological, and occupational functioning of injured workers with chronic pain disability. DESIGN: An uncontrolled pilot study of repeated measures was conducted. SETTING: The intervention was delivered in a community setting in the New South Wales region. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 30), mean age 41 years, had a compensable musculoskeletal injury: 60% were men, 63% had back injuries; the average time off work was 13 months. INTERVENTION: An interdisciplinary cognitive-behavioral study, the intervention was delivered using a multi-partner provider model (a clinical psychologist and a physical therapist from separate offices, working in conjunction with the participant's occupational rehabilitation provider and treating physician). Groups of six participants attended half a day per week for six weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included: physical functioning, pain intensity, and psychological variables, which were assessed before and after the program; and medical certification and job participation, which were recorded before the program and at six-month follow-up. RESULTS: Significant gains were made in pain intensity, physical and psychological functioning, and medical certification.Mean effect size of the intervention was medium to large (d = 0.70).There were no significant changes in employment status at six-month follow-up CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that rural or community-based independent professionals working collaboratively using an integrated treatment program can produce positive outcomes for workers injured by pain and achieve outcomes similar to those reported for pain based on metropolitan areas.c lines",0,0,
288,Can computer-generated evidence-based care suggestions improve evidence-based management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? A randomized controlled trial.,"Goal. Translation of evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice has been inconsistent. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of guideline-based care suggestions delivered to physicians by typing orders on computer workstations. study environment. Downtown academic general internal medicine practice. Study design. Randomized controlled trial of 246 physicians (25 percent faculty general internists, 75 percent internal medicine residents) and 20 outpatient pharmacists. We enrolled 706 of their primary care patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Medication care and monitoring tips were delivered to a random half of physicians and pharmacists when writing orders or filling prescriptions using computer workstations. A 2 × 2 factorial randomization of practice sessions and pharmacists resulted in four groups of patients: physician intervention, pharmacist intervention, both interventions, and controls. Data extraction/collection methods. Adherence to the guidelines and clinical activity was evaluated using the electronic medical record of the patients. Health-related quality of life, medication adherence, and satisfaction with care were assessed using telephone questionnaires. Main findings. During their year in the study, patients made an average of five scheduled primary care visits. There were no differences between groups in adherence to care suggestions, generic or condition-specific quality of life, satisfaction with physicians or pharmacists, medication adherence, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations. Physicians who received the intervention had significantly higher total health care costs. Physicians' attitudes toward the guidelines were mixed. Conclusions. Care suggestions displayed to physicians and pharmacists on computer workstations had no effect on the delivery or outcomes of care for patients with reactive airway disease.",1,1,
289,Can handheld computers improve guideline compliance? A Pilot Study (Palm) of Family Physicians in British Columbia,"OBJECTIVE To examine whether Palm Prevention, a free software tool for Palm OS personal digital assistants (PDAs) that provides quick access to preventive guidelines in a patient-specific manner at the point of care, improved adherence to five preventive measures in care primary. DESIGN Prospective intervention pilot study. SETTING Vancouver, BC and surrounding areas. PARTICIPANTS Eight general practitioners. INTERVENTIONS Each physician used Palm Prevention for five preventive measures during routine preventive health visits with 10 patients (n = 80). Charts of consenting patients were reviewed for documentation of recommended maneuvers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Compliance rates for five evidence-based guidelines selected from the Canadian and US Task Forces on Preventive Care and incorporated into Palm Prevention. RESULTS Intervention and control physicians were similar in their familiarity with and use of PDAs, and recruited similar patients for the study. The intervention and control groups had similar rates of hypertension detection. The intervention improved adherence to the remaining four guidelines: cervical cancer screening increased by 22% (only absolute increases are reported)""; hyperlipidemia screening increased by 30%; colorectal cancer screening increased by 27% ; and aspirin prophylaxis in high-risk patients increased by 38% Participants were surveyed after the study;"" all reported that they found the software useful and would continue to use Palm Prevention. Usage statistics showed that study participants used the tool outside of the trial: users entered between 28 and 68 unique patients into the program during the 2-month intervention. CONCLUSION This pilot study suggests that PDAs are useful for improving preventive care and facilitating the translation of knowledge into practice. This was particularly evident with the most recent guidelines.",0,1,
290,Can line doctors master the conceptual complexities of dialectical behavior therapy? An evaluation of a State Department of Mental Health training program,"Dialectical behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder has rapidly achieved widespread popularity, one indication being the development of training initiatives by the Department of Mental Health in at least two US states. Efficacy data published by the creator of the treatment, Marsha Linehan, and her colleagues probably explain, at least in part, this popularity. However, the complexity of DBT raises a fundamental question regarding these broader applications: can clinicians from diverse backgrounds acquire a shared and sophisticated understanding of treatment theory? The clinical utility of a treatment is largely based on ease of dissemination (APA, Template for Developing Guidelines: Interventions for Mental Disorders and Psychosocial Aspects of Physical Disorders. Washington, DC: Author, 1995), and in that sense, DBT : a complicated, multifaceted approach--might seem vulnerable. This vulnerability is accentuated when institutional adoption involves the collaboration of numerous clinicians, who, despite occupying diverse roles, must develop a shared understanding of the treatment. Using a detailed examination of DBT knowledge, we assessed the conceptual mastery of 109 clinicians trained through a State Department of Mental Health initiative. Test performance was specifically correlated with DBT training. Previous education or experience in behavioral therapy accounted for little variation, indicating that clinicians in a variety of roles acquired reasonable intellectual mastery of this complex model.",0,0,
291,'Can patient practice be increased simply by implementing agreed national guidelines?' An observational study,"OBJECTIVE: To increase the time of autonomous practice of patients in the stroke unit of a nursing home. INTERVENTION: Nurses stimulated and trained patients with the help of four interventions (strengthening muscles, balance and reach when sitting, rising from a chair, walking) from the Evidence-Based Clinical Nursing Rehabilitation Stroke Guidelines . DESIGN: Observational study. The practice time of elderly stroke patients in this study was compared with the time observed in our previous study in the same setting. SETTING: Nursing home rehabilitation units in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: Seventeen frail stroke patients, including 8 men, 9 women, with a mean age of 75.8 (SD +/- 9), and 17 subjects with the same characteristics who participated in a previous observational study. MAIN MEASURES: Time spent on therapeutic activities was measured using the Behavior Mapping method. RESULTS: Time spent in therapeutic activities increased significantly from 103.5 minutes measured in our previous study to 156.5 minutes in this study (Z = 2.86""; P < 0.005; ""d' = 1.09). Mean Barthel index was 8.8 (SD +/- 4.1). Patients with more possibilities were more active, resulting in a significantly positive Barthel Index-therapy time relationship (r = 0.73, P </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The autonomous practice time of elderly frail comorbid stroke patients increased during weekdays. The patients, stimulated and challenged by the nurses, exercise more and more according to their possibilities. Since this guideline was developed especially for nurses, nurses can encourage stroke patients to contribute more to autonomous practice and thus help their recovery.",0,0,
292,Can psychological models bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and physician behavior? A randomized controlled trial of an intervention to influence dentists' intention to implement evidence-based practice.,"OBJECTIVE: The lag between publication of evidence for clinical practice and implementation by clinicians can be decades. Research using psychological models shows that changing intention is very important in changing behavior. This study examined an intervention (trial of alternative actions) to change dentists' intention to implement evidence-based practice (EBP) for third molar (MT) management. DESIGN: Randomized/postal controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Dentists were randomly selected from the Scottish Board of Dental Practice Register, then randomly assigned to intervention or control groups, and sent a questionnaire. The intervention group listed management alternatives to TM removal prior to their intention to remove TM, and the control group did not. Based on psychological models to reduce the frequency of a behavior (EBP is weighted against TM extraction), the previous list of alternatives should decrease the extraction intention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intention to extract MT. RESULTS: A total of 99 dentists - 70 men, 29 women""; mean age = 41.42 years (SD = 8.62) participated in the study. The intervention significantly influenced the intention to extract TM, as desired. Despite similar backgrounds and knowledge of management alternatives, participants in the intervention group had significantly lower withdrawal intention: control group mean (SD) = 0.39 (1.99); intervention group mean ( SD) = -0.78 (1.89); mean difference (SE) = 1.17 (0.42);"" 95% confidence interval for the difference = 0.34 to 1.99. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this intervention, which successfully influenced a proximal predictor of behavior relevant to dental EBP, may result in EBP improvement in a service level trial. Basing implementation interventions and trial methodology on psychological models can effectively bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and practice.",0,1,
293,Can we address depression in vision rehabilitation settings? Professional Perspectives on Barriers to Integrating Problem-Solving Treatment,"PURPOSE: Low vision rehabilitation (LVR) is a relevant context to integrate evidence-based early psychological interventions given the high prevalence of untreated depression in visually impaired adults. This study aims to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to staff-provided telephone-based problem-solving treatment for primary care (PST-PC) offered as an integrated component of LVR. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews, developed using the theoretical domain framework (TDF) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), were conducted with 21 LVR professionals and a clinical psychologist involved in PST-PC delivery. Barriers and facilitators at practitioner, client, intervention and organization levels were identified with a thematic analysis using a 'theoretical' approach. RESULTS: Prominent barriers were lack of recognition of the role of PST-PC professionals (n = 32), unmet client expectation with PST-PC (n = 28), dissatisfaction with telephone delivery (n = 27) and the limited organizational awareness of PST. -PC (n = 39). Facilitating factors included a recognized need for evidence-based psychological services (n = 28), clients experiencing benefits in early sessions (n = 38), PST-PC promoting practical skills (n = 26), and comprehensive PST training -PC (n = 36). CONCLUSIONS: PST-PC can provide accessible early intervention for LVR clients with depressive symptoms. Ongoing professional training, clinical support, and assessment of potential LVR clients to determine appropriateness of treatment are likely to improve delivery in this setting. Implications for rehabilitation Depression is very common in adults participating in low vision rehabilitation (LVR) programmes, yet few receive support. Clinical guidelines recommend that integrated models of care be offered within rehabilitation settings as early intervention for mild to moderate levels of depressive symptoms. Integrated Telephone Problem-Solving Treatment for Primary Care (PST-PC) delivered by trained LVR professionals is a hands-on, skills-based model that has the potential to increase access to early psychological intervention for LVR clients with depressive symptoms . LVR clients are often older, have multiple comorbid health conditions, and a significant level of functional disability, requiring flexibility in the delivery of PST-PC and specialized staff training, and support in working with older and more complex clients. .",0,0,

A simple and multifaceted intervention in out-of-hours services,"OBJECTIVES: To improve the antimicrobial prescribing behavior of general practitioners in large-scale out-of-hours services for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in women aged 20 to 80 years, which is considered one of the most common bacterial infections. prevalent in primary care. watch out. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used in two large-scale regional after-hours services. A single, multifaceted intervention was offered over a 16-week period in one region (the intervention region). During the two washout periods, at 5 and 17 months, we observed diagnoses and prescriptions. The main outcome measure was the proportion of appropriate and inappropriate prescriptions. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with UIUI ranged from 1.0% to 2.1%. The relative proportion of appropriate prescriptions in the intervention region increased from 26.9% to 69.4%, but then decreased to 40.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, multifaceted intervention for the treatment of LUTIs during after-hours care may improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, although the improvement may not be sustained in the long term.",0,1,

297,"Canadian Guidelines for the Evidence-Based Treatment of Tic Disorders: Behavioral Therapy, Deep Brain Stimulation, and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","This clinical guideline provides recommendations for nonpharmacologic treatments for tic disorders. We conducted a systematic literature search for clinical trials on the treatment of tics. An evidence-based review (including 30 studies) and 3 studies on behavioral interventions, 3 studies on deep brain stimulation (DBS), and 3 studies on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) met the inclusion criteria. On the basis of this evidence, we have made strong recommendations for the use of behavior reversal therapy and exposure and response prevention, preferably integrated within a supportive psychoeducational programme, and with the option of combining any of these. pharmacotherapy approaches. Although there is evidence for the efficacy of DBS, the quality of this evidence is poor and the risks and burdens of the procedure are finely balanced against the perceived benefits. Our recommendation is that this intervention continue to be considered an experimental treatment for severe tics refractory to medical treatment that have severely limited quality of life. We recommend that the procedure only be performed in the context of research studies and by physicians experienced in DBS programming and tic management. There is no evidence to support the use of TMS in the treatment of tics. However, the procedure is associated with a low rate of known complications and could continue to be evaluated within research protocols. The recommendations we provide are based on current knowledge, and additional studies may result in their revision in the future.",0,0,
298,Canadian survey of clinical status at the start of dialysis 1998-1999: a prospective multicentre survey,"OBJECTIVES: The current growth in end-stage renal disease populations has led to increased efforts to understand the impact of status at the start of dialysis on long-term outcomes. Our primary objective was to improve understanding of current Canadian nephrology practice between October 1998 and December 1999. METHODS: Fifteen nephrology centers in 7 provinces participated in a prospective data collection survey. The main outcome of interest was clinical status at the start of dialysis determined by: residual renal function, readiness for chronic dialysis measured by the presence or absence of peritoneal access or permanent hemodialysis, hemoglobin and serum albumin. Uremic symptoms at the start of dialysis were also recorded; however, in some cases, these symptom data were obtained retrospectively. RESULTS: Data from 251 patients were collected during periods of 1 month. Patients began dialysis with calculated mean creatinine clearance levels of approximately 10 mL/min, with an average of 3 symptoms. 35% of patients starting dialysis had been known to nephrologists for less than 3 months. These patients are more likely to start without permanent access and with lower hemoglobin and albumin levels. Even of those known to nephrologists, only 66% had permanent access. CONCLUSIONS: Patients starting dialysis in Canada appear to do so in relative concordance with published guidelines regarding timing of start. Despite increased awareness of kidney disease, a considerable number of patients continue to start dialysis without the prior care of a nephrologist. Of those that are seen by nephrologists, clinical and laboratory parameters are suboptimal according to current guidelines. This survey serves as an important baseline for future comparisons after the implementation of educational strategies for referring physicians and nephrologists.",0,0,
299,Adolescent path of cancer in France between 1988 and 1997,"We report an adolescent cancer pathway from referral, through diagnosis and treatment, to follow-up in France. All cancer cases between 15 and 19 years of age, diagnosed between 1988 and 1997, registered by nine French population-based cancer registries (10% of the French population) were included. Management of adolescent cancer by pediatricians was rare. An adolescent's journey through cancer care can be summarized as the first visit to the general practitioner, referral to the adult oncologist for hematologic malignancies and medical or surgical specialists for solid tumors, treatment in the adult unit, and follow-up by an adult medical or surgical oncologist. specialist or general practitioner. Only 9% of 15-19 year olds enter a clinical trial (respectively 6% and 3% in adult and pediatric clinical trials). The inclusion rate changes by diagnosis, highest for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (39%), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (27%), and acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (20%). Only 4% of adolescent cancers were managed in shared adult-pediatric departments, especially for soft tissue sarcomas (14.9%), malignant bone tumors (13.4%), central nervous system tumors (6, 2%) and NHL (4.4%). Whatever the reasons for non-participation in clinical trials, an ideal model that requires communication and cooperation among all pediatric and adult specialists involved in adolescent cancer care should reduce the large gap in access to cooperative groups. .",0,0,
300,Cancer education among primary care physicians in an underserved community,"INTRODUCTION: Urban minority groups, such as those living in northern Manhattan, are generally underserved with regard to cancer screening and prevention practices. Primary care physicians are in a critical position to counsel their patients on these issues and to order screening tests for their patients. METHODS: Eighty-four primary care physicians in two intervention communities who received cancer screening and prevention education visits were compared with 38 physicians in a nearby community who received no intervention. Using pre- and post-test interviews over an 18-month period, physicians were asked about their attitudes, knowledge (relative to American Cancer Society guidelines), and likelihood of breast cancer screening and counseling , cervical, colorectal and prostate. cancers RESULTS: Comparison of the two physician surveys indicated no statistically significant differences in knowledge of cancer prevention or detection. However, on post-test, intervention group physicians identified significantly fewer barriers to practice than control physicians (p<0.05). Although, in general, educational visits to inner-city primary care physicians did not appear to significantly alter cancer prevention practices, there was a positive dose-response relationship between the subgroup of participants who received three or more contacts of the draft. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant changes in attitude due to academic details among urban primary care physicians practicing in northern Manhattan. A significant pre-test sensitization effect and small numbers may have masked overall changes in cancer prevention and screening behaviors among clinicians due to the intervention.",0,0,
301,Fatigue related to cancer and treatment,"Fatigue is a distressing and persistent symptom for gynecologic cancer patients and survivors. Cancer-related debilitating fatigue (CRF) is caused by both the disease and its treatment. Although awareness and study of CRF have increased in recent years, constant evaluation has not been a priority in routine medical practice. The pathophysiological mechanisms that induce CRF remain unclear and effective pharmacological interventions have not yet been established. Based on the literature and the results of our own research, this review focuses on recent progress toward understanding the nature and causes of CRF and on several promising treatment modalities. Given the prevalence and severity of CKD in the gynecologic cancer patient population, it is of paramount importance to establish standardized methods of fatigue measurement and management in routine clinical oncology care. However, it remains hypothetical whether CRF has an underlying inflammatory cause, and no mechanism-driven symptom intervention is currently used clinically, although the development of such interventions would provide patients with greater symptom control. Advancing translational and clinical fatigue research will require well-designed anatomical pathway studies and clinical investigations that focus on the development of mechanism-driven interventions based on physiological-behavioral fatigue research, the implementation of guidelines for experimental designs, and the discovery of biomarkers that identify individuals at high levels. CRI risk. Validated patient-reported outcome measures are an essential component of such clinical trials. Because there are numerous subscales, unidimensional measures, and multidimensional measures, clinicians and researchers should consider individual circumstances, good clinical practice, and research objectives as guides in choosing the most appropriate fatigue measurement tool. In addition, education about CRF should be made available to all patients and their caregivers, as accurate, age-appropriate information about conditions like CRF can alleviate much of the stress and anxiety that comes from miscommunication about this distressing condition. condition.",0,0,
302,Interactions of cardiac drugs and psychoactive drugs: meaning and recommendations,"Understanding cardiac drug interactions with concurrent psychotropic prescriptions is essential for the practicing cardiologist and primary care physician, as well as the psychiatrist. There has been an explosive use of new drugs in both psychiatry and cardiology without widespread knowledge of their possible interactions. The increasing trend toward polypharmacy, the use of psychotropic medications by cardiologists and primary care physicians caring for cardiac patients, and the growth of the aging population present great challenges to the physician. Finally, there is a need to have models/paradigms to predict possible drug interactions, for example, the cytochrome p450 scheme. This article describes a method for identifying, understanding, and coding cardiac and psychotropic drug interactions, a systematic approach to updating this key database, and specific cardiac and psychotropic drug interactions. Specifically, this document 1) details the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical importance, 3) describes the potential mechanisms of the interactions, and 4) provides recommendations to the clinician. Since most of the original clinical trials, whether for cardiac or psychotropic drugs, do not include studies comparing these two drug domains at the same time, their interactions are often known only with their combined use in the clinical setting, using at patient as ""guinea pig"". , and through subsequent reports.",0,0,
303,Cardiac rehabilitation and risk factor management after myocardial infarction. Clinical and economic evaluation,"The increasing scarcity of available and finite healthcare resources and the increasing demand for healthcare have made consideration of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services, such as secondary prevention of heart disease, imperative. There is considerable evidence that modifying smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and physical inactivity, either alone or in combination, are effective in reducing the number of clinical events in the secondary prevention of heart disease. Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of costs and consequences. The data generated in the economic evaluations of health services, such as the modification of risk factors in the secondary prevention of heart disease, are useful for developing clinical practice guidelines and health policies. Smoking cessation is the most cost-effective intervention for people with documented heart disease, whereas treatment of hyperlipidemia and referral to cardiac rehabilitation are highly cost-effective per quality-adjusted life year and relatively cost-effective per life year saved. Risk factor management, provided by a team that includes cardiovascular specialists and other physicians along with appropriately trained allied health professionals, is the cornerstone of optimal care in the primary and secondary prevention of heart disease.",0,0,
304,Cardiac Rehabilitation: Unraveling the Complexity of Bypass and Current Delivery Models,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines recommend risk factor reduction strategies for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes, but referral and completion programs to provide this advice are poor. PURPOSE: In this article, we describe the complexity of factors influencing the referral and delivery of evidence-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs across an Australian context and provide guidance for clinicians and policymakers to consider solutions. The Ecological Approach is used as a framework to synthesize the evidence. The approach has 5 categories, whose characteristics can act as barriers and facilitators for the promotion and adoption of healthy behaviors and includes (a) interpersonal factors, (b) interpersonal factors, (c) institutional factors, (d) community networks, and e) Public politics. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the context of strong evidence of efficacy, this review highlights systematic failures in the implementation of CR, an important intervention that has been shown to improve patient outcomes and prevent cardiac events. Recommendations from this review include standardizing program delivery, improving data capture, using technological innovations and social media to facilitate the delivery of information and support, and establishing a cohesive and consistent message across of the interorganizational collaboration involved in CR. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These pathways provide guidance for potential solutions to improve CR acceptance and secondary prevention.",0,0,
305,Care in specialized medical and mental health units compared with standard care for older people with cognitive impairment admitted to a general hospital: a randomized controlled trial (NIHR TEAM trial),"OBJECTIVE To develop and evaluate a best practice model of general hospital acute medical care for older people with cognitive impairment. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial, adapted to take into account the limitations imposed by a busy acute medical admission system. SETTING Large acute care general hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS 600 patients older than 65 years admitted for acute care, identified as 'confused' on admission. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to a specialized medical and mental health unit designed to provide the best care for people with delirium or dementia, or to standard care (general medical or acute geriatric wards). Features of the specialist unit included ""co-staffing of medical and mental health professionals""; enhanced staff training in delirium, dementia, and person-centered dementia care; provision of purposeful organized activity; environmental modification for meeting the needs of people with cognitive impairment, delirium prevention, and a proactive and inclusive approach for family caregivers MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES PRIMARY OUTCOME number of days spent at home during the 90 days after randomization SECONDARY OUTCOMES non-participant observations structured to to determine patients' experiences of family carers' satisfaction with hospital care.When possible, outcome assessment was blinded to allocation.RESULTSThere were no significant differences in days spent at home between the specialized unit and care groups. standard function (median 51 vs 45 days, 95% confidence interval for difference -12 to 24; P = 0.3 Median hospital stay rate was 11 vs. 11 days, mortality 22% vs. 25% (-9% to 4%), readmission 32% vs. 35% (-10% to 5%) and new nursing home admission 20% versus 28% (-16% to 0) for the specialist unit and standard care groups, respectively. Patients who returned home spent a median of 70.5 versus 71.0 days at home (-6.0 to 6.5).

306,Caring for Adults with Developmental Disabilities: Effects of a Continuing Education Course for Primary Care Providers,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a guideline-based interdisciplinary continuing education course on measures related to the care of adults with developmental disabilities (DD). DESIGN: Before-and-after study with a control group. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven primary care providers (physicians, registered nurses, and nurse practitioners). INTERVENTION: Participants received only reference material on primary care of people with DD (control group) or participated in a continuing education course on primary care of people with DD in addition to receiving the reference material (intervention group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported 5 key measures related to the care of adults with DD: frequency of use of guidelines, frequency of periodic health examinations, frequency of evaluation of patients presenting behavior changes, level of comfort when caring for adults with DD, and knowledge of primary care related to adults with DD.

307,Caring for the menopausal patient: the view of a nurse practitioner,"PURPOSE: To assess the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) and other treatment options for early postmenopausal women. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials, selected peer-reviewed literature, and recent clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies of HT may not be directly applicable to healthy early postmenopausal women with hot flashes. HT is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. The benefits of HT for relieving menopausal symptoms are likely to outweigh the risks in this population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of the WHI reinforce the importance of individualized care based on a woman's medical history, medical needs, and desired outcomes. Nurses can help their patients put recent results into perspective. When HT is used, nurse practitioners should consider using lower doses and reassess the need for therapy annually.",0,0,
308,CD4 cell count and viral load monitoring in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE To examine the cost and cost-effectiveness of quarterly monitoring of CD4 cell counts and viral load among patients taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN Cost-effectiveness study. SETTING A randomized trial in a home-based ART program in Tororo, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS People with HIV who were members of the AIDS Support Organization and had CD4 cell counts <250 × 10(6) cells/L or World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Results calculated for the study period and projected 15 years into the future included costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs""; $ per DALY averted). Cost inputs were based on trial and other sources Clinical inputs derived from trial; in the base case, we assumed point estimates reflected true but not significant differences We performed univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyzes INTERVENTIONS Three follow-up strategies : clinical follow-up with quarterly CD4 cell counts and viral load measurement (clinical/CD4/viral load); clinical monitoring and quarterly CD4 count (clinical/CD4);"" and clinical follow-up alone. RESULTS Using intention-to-treat (ITT) outcomes per 100 people starting ART, we found that CD4/clinical monitoring compared to clinical monitoring alone increases costs by $20,458 (£12,780, €14,707) and avoids 117.3 DALYs (ICER = $174 per DALY). Clinical monitoring/CD4/viral load compared to clinical monitoring/CD4 adds $142,458 and avoids 27.5 DALYs ($5181 per DALY). The superior ICER for clinical/CD4 monitoring is robust to uncertainties in input values, and that strategy is dominant (less expensive and more effective) compared to clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring in a quarter of simulations . If clinical inputs are based on analysis of treatment starting at 90 days (after laboratory monitoring began), then clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring is dominated by other strategies. CONCLUSIONS Based on this trial, compared to clinical monitoring alone, routine CD4 cell count monitoring is considerably more cost-effective than adding routine viral load testing to the monitoring strategy and is more cost-effective than ART.",0,0,
309,Adolescent Cervical Cancer Screening: An Evidence-Based Internet Education Program to Improve Practice Among Advanced Practice Nurses,"BACKGROUND: The literature reports wide variation in levels of awareness and application of recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines in clinical practice. Evidence-based screening guidelines for cervical cancer prevention and early detection offer health care providers an opportunity to improve practice patterns among adolescents by decreasing psychological distress and reducing health care costs and burdens. morbidities associated with overscreening. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot intervention study was to determine the effects of a web-based continuing education unit (CEU) program on advanced practice nurses' (APN) knowledge of current evidence-based recommendations for screening for cervical cancer and its application in practice. This paper presents a process improvement project as an example of a way to disseminate up-to-date, evidence-based practice guidelines to busy health care providers. METHODS: This web-based CEU program was developed, tested, and evaluated specifically for APN. The program addressed her level of knowledge about cervical cancer and its relationship to high-risk human papillomavirus. He also discussed new cervical cancer screening guidelines and the application of those guidelines in clinical practice. FINDINGS: The results of the study indicated that there are gaps in knowledge among NPCs about cervical cancer screening in adolescents. However, when provided with a CEU educational intervention, APNs' knowledge levels increased and their self-reported clinical practice behaviors changed in accordance with new cervical cancer screening guidelines. LINKING EVIDENCE TO PRACTICE: Providing convenient and easily accessible up-to-date e-content provided by CEUs improves adoption of clinical practice guidelines, which decreases the potential for morbidities associated with overscreening for cervical cancer in adolescents and young women.",0,0,
310,Challenges and opportunities associated with the introduction of next-generation long-lasting insecticidal nets for malaria control: a case study from Burkina Faso,"Background Reductions in malaria incidence in Africa can be largely attributed to increases in malaria vector control activities, predominantly the use of long-lasting insecticidal bed nets (LLINs). . With insecticide resistance affecting an increasing number of malaria-endemic countries and threatening the efficacy of conventional LLINs, there is a growing urgency to implement alternative tools to control these resistant populations. study was to identify potential challenges and opportunities for accelerating access to next-generation LLINs in Burkina Faso, a country with areas of high levels of insecticide resistance Methods An analytical framework was used to guide the selection of interviewees, the collection and the data analysis Semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted in April 2014 in Burkina Faso. Interviews were conducted in French and English, audio recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVivo 10 for data management and analysis. They were coded according to the framework themes and then analyzed to provide a description of key points and to explain patterns in the data. Results Interviewees reported that the policy architecture in Burkina Faso is characterized by a strong framework of actors contributing to policymaking and a strong national research capacity that indirectly contributes to national policy change through collaboration with targeted research. internationally. The funding has a significant impact on the potential adoption, availability, and affordability of next-generation LLINs. This confers significant power on international donors who fund vector control. National decisions about which LLIN to purchase were restricted to quantity and delivery dates; the potential to address insecticide resistance was not part of the decision-making process. Additionally, at the time of the study, there was no World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on where and when next-generation MILDs could have a positive impact on malaria transmission, severely limiting their adoption, availability, and availability. affordability. Conclusions This study shows that access to next-generation MILDs was seriously compromised by a lack of global guidance. Burkina Faso, where WHO recommendations are adopted relatively quickly, a clear WHO recommendation and adequate funding will be key to accelerating access to next-generation LILDCs.",0,0,
311,"Changeability, Trust, Common Sense, and Corroboration: Comprehensive Suicide Risk Assessment","OBJECTIVE: The authors, in collaboration with NSW Health, recently developed a comprehensive suicide risk assessment framework. This article describes key concepts in the assessment of suicide risk by mental health professionals. METHODS: A framework for conducting a comprehensive suicide risk assessment was derived from the literature, incident analysis, and clinical experience. The framework underwent a consultation process involving clinicians from NSW area mental health services. The goal was to provide clinicians with a standardized concept map for suicide risk assessment. A MEDLINE search was performed for publications related to 'suicide' and 'suicide risk assessment' between 1980 and 2002. Recommendations from sentinel event reviews conducted in a NSW area mental health service were reviewed in the period 1999-2002. Lessons from a visit to a coroner's family support group for people who had experienced suicide also informed the development of the guidelines. RESULTS: A framework for suicide risk assessment is proposed. The framework promotes a reflective style of practice, encouraging clinicians to assess their assessment and its limitations. Risk assessment is always carried out as part of a full clinical evaluation and an assessment of the person's current situation and psychosociocultural context. The concepts of changeability, confidence in evaluation, common sense, and the importance of corroboration are incorporated into the framework. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health clinicians can be guided by a framework in assessing and documenting suicide risk. Suicide risk assessment may generate a suicide risk score for which minimum standards of care may be required.",0,0,
312,Changes and challenges: managing ADHD in a fast-paced world,"BACKGROUND: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects the lives of children and adults. If left undiagnosed and untreated, ADHD can have serious lifelong consequences. Research has identified diagnostic clues, neurotransmitter pathways, and psychiatric comorbidities related to ADHD, as well as effective pharmacological, behavioral, and psychosocial interventions. Stimulant agents have been the mainstay of ADHD therapy for more than 50 years. The availability of new extended-release (XR or ER) and longer-acting (LA) formulations and new agents allows for broader and more individualized treatment options. Side effects of stimulants are generally mild, short-lived, and respond to adjustments in dosage or timing. Outcomes in ADHD treatment can be improved with the use of clear treatment guidelines and tools to help clinicians implement them efficiently and effectively. The Texas Children's Medication Algorithm Project (CMAP) provides an algorithm-based treatment decision system that is evidence-based and easy to implement. OBJECTIVE: (1) to review the psychological components of mindfulness, the neurotransmitter pathways associated with ADHD, and the variety of therapeutic options for ADHD, with an emphasis on the most recent introductions to the therapeutic armamentarium""; (2) to discuss the rare psychiatric problems and cardiovascular side effects associated with stimulants; (3) review abuse liability, comorbidities, and suggested approaches to these problems;"" and (4) review the development and use of CMAP and provide resources for its implementation in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiology of ADHD is related to dysfunction of fronto-subcortical networks and dysregulation of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and nicotinic neurotransmitter systems. An additive effect of multiple genes, as well as environmental influences, contributes to the clinical picture. Stimulant and non-stimulant treatment has been shown to be effective in different subgroups, with the effectiveness of specific agents most likely related to the primary neurotransmitter involved. The availability of transdermal stimulant formulations, XR, ER, and LA, as well as alternative non-stimulant agents, offers new options for pharmacotherapy of ADHD. Major concerns associated with the potential for stimulant abuse have been allayed by the availability of ER formulations, which have reduced the boosting effects associated with short-acting preparations. Medication outcomes in ADHD can be improved through the use of evidence-based algorithms such as CMAP. The keys to success are proper initial assessment and diagnosis, the use of sustained-release products, sufficient dose titration, and the use of clinical rating scales with feedback from caregivers and teachers. Optimal treatment outcomes can be achieved by appropriate pharmacotherapy combined with psychosocial interventions.",0,0,
313,"Changes in insurance physicians' attitudes, self-efficacy, intention, and knowledge and skills about depression guidelines following an implementation strategy","INTRODUCTION: To improve guideline compliance by insurance physicians (IPs), an implementation strategy was developed and investigated in a randomized controlled trial. This implementation strategy involved a multifaceted training program for a group of IPs in the application of the depression guidelines. In this study we report the impact of implementation strategy on clinicians' attitude, intention, self-efficacy, and knowledge and skills as behavioral determinants of guideline adherence. Links between these self-reported behavioral determinants and levels of guideline adherence were also determined. METHODS: Just before and 3 months after the implementation of the multifaceted training, a questionnaire designed to measure behavioral determinants based on the ASE model (attitude, social norm, self-efficacy) was completed by the intervention (n = 21) and the control group (n = 19). Questionnaire items were grouped to form ASE determinant scales. The internal consistency of the scales was calculated using Cronbach's alphas. Between-group differences in changes in ASE determinants and the association of these changes with improvements in adherence to guidelines were analyzed using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the ASE determinants scales was shown to be sufficiently reliable, with Cronbach's alphas of at least 0.70. At follow-up after 3 months, PIs receiving the implementation strategy showed significant improvement over PIs in the control group for all investigated ASE determinants. Changes in knowledge and skills were only weakly associated with improvements in adherence to guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation strategy developed for insurance physicians can increase their attitude, intention, self-efficacy, and knowledge and skills in applying the depression guidelines. These changes in behavioral determinants could indicate positive changes in IP behavior toward the use of depression guidelines. However, only changes in knowledge and skills related to guideline use were associated with improvements in IPs' actual performance when applying the guidelines.",0,0,
314,Changes in lifestyle habits after advice from nurse practitioners: 1-year results from the Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle study.,"OBJECTIVES: The Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle (GOAL) study has as its primary objective the prevention of weight gain by nurse practitioners (NPs) guided by a standardized computerized software program. Since favorable changes in physical activity (PA) and diet can improve health independent of weight (loss), it is essential to understand the effects on lifestyle habits. We examined the 1-year effects of NP lifestyle advice on PA and diet, compared with usual general practitioner care (GP-UC). DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Eleven general practice locations in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: A total of 341 GOAL participants with overweight or obesity and hypertension or dyslipidemia, or both, who completed an FFQ and a short questionnaire to assess physical activity that improves health (SQUASH) at baseline and after 1 year. RESULTS: After 1 year, the NP group spent 33 min/week more walking compared to the GP-UC group who spent -5 min/week walking (P = 0.05). No significant differences were found between the NP and GP-UC groups in the percentage of people who met the PA guidelines. In both groups, nutrient intake changed in a favorable direction and participants more often met dietary guidelines, but with no overall difference between the NP and GP-UC groups. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of an increase in walking (based on self-reported data) in the NP group, there were no intervention effects on physical activity and diet. Positive changes in nutrient intake were observed in both groups.",0,0,
315,Changes in the knowledge and behaviors of nursing professionals after a brief training on the guidelines of healthy eating and joint activities (HEAT),"INTRODUCTION: Primary care providers, particularly pediatric nurses, are an integral force involved in addressing the obesity epidemic among youth. However, most nurse practitioners report a low level of competence in their ability to adequately prevent and treat pediatric overweight. In response, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) developed the Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on Healthy Eating and Joint Activity (HEAT) to Improve Behavior and the effectiveness of providers. METHOD: Thirty-five nurse practitioners who attended the NAPNAP Annual Conference participated in an intensive 4-hour HEAT CPG training session. Pre- and post-training data were collected on providers' knowledge, practical behaviors, and barriers in relation to preventing overweight among youth. RESULTS: Post-training results revealed significant improvements in (a) practitioners' knowledge (assessment of patient growth, family history, psychosocial functioning, nutrition, and physical activity)""; (b) practitioners' intention to improve behavioral (i.e., increased intention to use behavior modification and counseling aimed at patient and family behavior change);"" and (c) practitioners' report of increased confidence in the ability to address barriers. DISCUSSION: The study findings demonstrate preliminary support for CPG HEAT as an effective tool to help providers improve their ability to maintain patients' healthy weight. Future research is needed to verify the effects of HEAT CPG on long-term improvements in care.",0,0,

BACKGROUND: The notion that communication is essential to staff-resident interaction is widely accepted in both theory and practice, as is the notion that communicative behavior influences patient outcomes. No study to date has focused on whether residents are influenced by staff's use of guidelines derived from gerotranscendence theory. DESIGN: The study was exploratory in nature and used a qualitative approach. METHODS: Data were collected through interviews with residents and participant observations; a qualitative content analysis was performed. SAMPLE SIZE: six residents. RESULTS: The study shows that many residents reviewed and reflected on their lives, and that this aspect changed during the study period. Some residents' descriptions of their situation revealed that certain changes had occurred in the social life of the ward, these changes could be an effect of the intervention. know and provide the best nursing care and individualized treatment to each resident;"" this implies a holistic vision that helps residents in their aging process.

This study investigated the effects of an educational program based on reflection on experience on the quality of care for patients with hip fracture in Lazio, Italy. METHODS: Five hospitals participated. The study consisted of the development of a clinical pathway, a preparatory phase and the educational intervention itself, which included a course followed by monthly audits with reflection on the practice, guided by the analysis of the patients' medical records. Data on the quality of care for hip fracture patients were collected from the routine information system for the period before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients who underwent surgery within 48 hours of admission (from 7% in 2006 to 26.4% in 2007) and a significant reduction in the mean length of hospital stay. (from 18.8 to 16.4 days). Some process indicators of quality of care were high after the intervention, although non-recommended practices are still used routinely (eg, urinary catheterization in 72.2% of patients). There were differences in changes when comparing hospitals. CONCLUSION: An educational intervention that combined the dissemination of a clinical pathway with an external audit oriented to reflection on practice was effective in promoting changes in the behaviors of physicians. The persistence of non-recommended practices and variation between hospitals indicate that multiple factors influence performance and affect the effectiveness of interventions.",0,0,
320,Changing human behavior to prevent disease: the importance of focusing on automatic processes.,"Much of the global burden of disease is associated with behaviors (overeating, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity) that people recognize as harmful to health and yet continue to engage in, even when unintended consequences arise. . To date, interventions aimed at changing such behaviors have largely encouraged people to reflect on their behaviors. These approaches are often ineffective, consistent with the observation that much human behavior is automatic, guided by environmental stimuli, resulting in actions that are largely unaccompanied by conscious thought. We propose that interventions targeting these automatic bases of behaviors may be more effective. We discuss specific interventions and suggest ways to determine if and how interventions that focus on automatic processes can improve global efforts to prevent disease.",0,1,
321,Changing Minds: Bounded Rationality and Heuristic Processes in Exercise-Related Judgments and Choices.,"Theories currently used to understand, predict, and promote physical activity and exercise represent information-processing models of the mind. A fundamental assumption underlying these theories is that human judgment and decision-making processes are rational. Therefore, interventions derived from these models aim to improve ""data entry"" (eg, providing complete, accurate, and convincing information about health benefits) with the expectation that rational evaluation of these data results in the desired behavioral ""outcome."" Given the modest effectiveness of interventions based on these models, we designed 2 experiments to test the validity of the rationality assumption, focusing specifically on exercise-related judgments and decisions. In Experiment 1, exercise judgments were altered by changing an arbitrary anchor, the presence of which should not have influenced these judgments. In Experiment 2, preference between a target and an alternative exercise session increased with the mere addition of a third ""decoy"" exercise option. Together, these experiments demonstrate that important motivational variables, including perceived exercise desirability, affective attitude, intention, affective forecasts, and exercise choices can be manipulated in a predictable direction without providing any relevant new information, but simply by pointing to specific and well-informed objectives. characterized heuristics. Therefore, these data provide evidence that the ""limited"" character of human rationality is also manifested in the exercise of judgments and decisions. Exercise researchers and practitioners should consider incorporating process heuristics within dual-process theoretical models of physical activity and exercise behavior.

322,Changing physician behavior to improve disease prevention,"Physicians often fail to provide their patients with nationally recommended preventive services. Addressing this, we have reviewed selected literature on how to change medical behavior using the organizational construction of the transtheoretical model of 'readiness for change'. This model suggests that behavior evolves through stages from precontemplation to contemplation, preparation, initiation, and maintenance of change. Traditional continuing medical education can affect knowledge and beliefs, but rarely results in behavioral change. However, motivational strategies such as practice feedback reports and influential peers can encourage stage change. Successful interventions targeting clinicians preparing for change often use a practice system approach that targets not only clinicians, but also practice staff and patients. Illustrating how the readiness-for-change model can guide the design and implementation of interventions, we describe strategies being used in a statewide randomized controlled trial to improve cancer prevention counseling and early detection by of primary care physicians. Partners for Prevention's multi-stage interventions include support from a medical liability insurer, a motivational videotape, a task-outlined office manual, graphic flowcharts, patient activation forms, practice, a designated prevention coordinator within each practice, and regular phone calls and visits from project staff.",0,0,
323,Changing Physician Behavior: What Works?,"OBJECTIVES: There are several interventions for guideline implementation in clinical practice, but the effects of these interventions are generally unclear. We conducted a systematic review to identify effective methods for implementing clinical research findings and clinical guidelines to change medical practice patterns, in surgical and general practice. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of reviews. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed) were searched for systematic reviews published in English that evaluated the effectiveness of different implementation methods. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility for inclusion and methodological quality and extracted relevant data. RESULTS: Fourteen reviews covering a wide range of interventions were identified. Intervention methods used include: audit and feedback, computerized decision support systems, continuing medical education, financial incentives, local opinion leaders, marketing, passive dissemination of information, patient-mediated interventions, reminders, and multifaceted interventions. Active approaches, such as academic details, produced greater effects than traditional passive approaches. Based on the findings of 3 reviews, 71% of the studies included in these reviews showed a positive change in physician behavior when exposed to active educational methods and multifaceted interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Active forms of continuing medical education and multifaceted interventions were found to be the most effective methods for implementing the guidelines in general practice. In addition, active approaches to changing physician performance have been shown to improve practice to a greater extent than traditional passive methods. More primary research is needed to assess the effectiveness of these methods in a surgical setting.",0,1,
324,Changing the behavior of medical practice to measure and improve clinical outcomes,"Medical practice behavior often results in poor clinical outcomes in managing cardiovascular disease risk factors despite effective treatments and guidelines. The behavior of 165 physicians in 2 settings (suburban and urban) was studied. After collecting baseline clinical data, including systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a series of interventions, including academic details, were carried out. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 10.4% in suburban patients with cardiovascular disease in the intervention group (P = 0.001) and by 10.5% in the enhanced intervention group (P = 0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 1.11% (P = 0.357) in the intervention group and by 5.13% in the enhanced intervention group (P < 0.001). In urban hypertensives, systolic blood pressure decreased by 5.03% (p = 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 7.01% (p < 0.001). Combining urban and suburban data, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 9.32% (p < 0.001) and systolic blood pressure decreased by 4.00% (p < 0.001). Providing clinicians with their clinical results, revising national guidelines, and setting expectations, associated with modest innovations in practice systems, can produce significant and measurable clinical improvements.",0,0,

326,Chapter: A review of self-management support for musculoskeletal (work-related) pain disorders.,"The form of the review of self-management interventions for chronic diseases and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) within this chapter is narrative. Individual qualitative and quantitative research studies, as well as systematic reviews and other reviews of relevance, were considered. We searched four major databases for relevant peer-reviewed literature published in the last 10 years. Publications prior to this period were included in the review if the work was considered seminal in terms of its contribution to the self-management knowledge base within the context of interest. The following terms were used as keywords and linked using Boolean operators: self-care, self-management, chronic illness, chronic illness, topical patient education, patient-centered care, health behavior, low back pain, and musculoskeletal disorders. Since the review focused on people of working age, the limits applied included English language and adults aged 15 to 64 years. Relevant gray literature and references from key authors in the field were also consulted. We did not formally assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Identified peer-reviewed studies were then screened for intervention components that are conceptually closely linked to self-management and the involvement of chronic conditions, especially MSD, and excluded otherwise.

327,Chapter: Behavioral economics and commitment to treatment.,"Behavioral economics is a field that integrates concepts from psychology and economics to explain individuals' decision-making. In recent years, this field has been increasingly incorporated into healthcare settings to promote healthier lifestyles. Participants typically receive monetary incentives when an objective or target behavior is objectively verified. In this chapter, we describe this evidence-based treatment, often referred to as contingency management. This chapter is structured in four parts. The ""Background"" section reviews the historical background of incentive-based interventions applied to substance abuse treatment. The ""Application of Incentive-Based Interventions to Medication Goals"" section describes the application of these interventions to other medication goals, such as immunizations, medical screening, diabetes control, physical activity, and weight loss programs. The section ""Key Elements and Concepts Embedded in Incentive-Based Interventions"" explains the key concepts and elements embedded in effective incentive-based interventions, and the final section discusses issues related to the implementation and spread of incentive programs.

328,Chapter: Escape from cognitivism: Exercise as a hedonic experience.,"Establishing its social relevance should be a strategic goal for exercise psychology. Progress toward this goal, however, has been slower than anyone in the field would have liked. In this chapter, we argue that, in part, the lack of intervention methods that can reliably and significantly increase physical activity level may be due to too narrow a metatheoretical perspective. We illustrate that all the main theories in vogue within exercise psychology in the last decades are derivatives of the same (cognitivist) metatheoretical framework. As such, they all exhibit a crucial limitation, namely the relative disregard for the motivational properties of affective constructs, such as central affect, moods, and emotions. Research over the past 15 years has shown that the old adage that ""exercise makes people feel better"" is wrong. Therefore, the central goal of this chapter was to underscore the urgent need for the field of exercise psychology to transition into the postcognitive era.

329,Characteristics of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in Swiss primary care,"BACKGROUND: Although a variety of treatment regimens are available for patients with type 2 diabetes, most patients do not achieve recommended goals. Our aim was to characterize Swiss primary care patients with type 2 diabetes who do not meet HbA1c treatment targets and reveal factors associated with poorly controlled HbA1c level. METHODS: Cross-sectional study nested within the Chronic Care for Diabetes randomized controlled trial. Patients with type 2 diabetes with at least one HbA1c measurement >/= 7.0% during the past year were recruited from Swiss primary care. Data evaluation included general and diabetes-specific clinical measures, treatment factors, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: 326 patients with type 2 diabetes from 30 primary care clinics with a mean age of 67.1 +/- 10.6 years participated in the study. Patient results for HbA1c were 7.7 +/- 1.3%, for systolic blood pressure 139.1 +/- 17.6 mmHg, for diastolic blood pressure 80.9 +/- 10.5 mmHg, and for low-density lipoproteins 2.7 +/- 1.1. 93.3% of the patients suffered from at least one comorbidity and were treated with 4.8 +/- 2.1 different drugs. No determining factor was significantly related to HbA1c in multiple analysis, but a significant pooling effect of GPs on HbA1c could be found. CONCLUSIONS: Within our sample of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, no ""hot spots"" can be pinpointed that can be easily addressed by any type of intervention. Especially within this subgroup of patients with diabetes who would benefit most from appropriate interventions to improve diabetes control, there appears to be a complex interplay between diabetes control, comorbidities, GP treatment, and behavior. of patients' health. Until now, this interaction has only been poorly described and understood.",0,0,
330,Characteristics of successfully implemented telemedical applications,"Background There has been an increased interest in the use of telemedicine applications in clinical practice in recent years. Considerable effort has been invested in testing and experimental services. However, surprisingly few applications have continued beyond the research and development phase. The objective of this study is to explore the characteristics of successfully implemented telemedical applications. Methods A comprehensive search of the telemedicine literature was performed to identify relevant articles. Following a defined selection process, a small number of articles describing features of successfully implemented telemedical applications were identified. These articles were analyzed qualitatively, based on the core procedures of the Grounded Theory (GT), including condensation and categorization. The analysis resulted in a description of the characteristics that were considered important for a successful implementation of telemedicine. Subsequently, these characteristics were discussed in the light of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the concept of 'social negotiation'. Results Telemedicine applications introduced into routine practice are typically characterized by the following six features: 1) local service delivery issues have been clearly established, 2) telemedicine has been seen as a benefit, 3) telemedicine has been seen as a solution to political and medical problems. 4) there was collaboration between promoters and users, 5) organizational issues and technological arrangements have been addressed, and 6) the future operation of the service has been considered. Conclusion Our findings support research that argues that technologies are not fixed entities that pass from invention to diffusion and routine use. Rather, it is the interaction between technical and social factors that produces a particular result. The success of a technology depends on how this interaction is managed during the implementation process.",0,0,
331,Child survival in the Third World: a functional analysis of oral rehydration therapy dissemination campaigns,"PIP: Behavior analysts conducted a functional analysis of different intervention strategies employed in 14 oral rehydration therapy (ORT) campaigns in 10 developing countries. Intervention investigators manipulated antecedents, behaviors, and/or consequences to improve diarrhea management. The strategies used radio ads, posters, and brochures to promote behavior change. Only 2 campaigns (Thailand and Egypt) limited their intervention to this background. Only 3 programs manipulated antecedents, behaviors and consequences. The 1983 campaign in Bangladesh incorporated school instruction for siblings and home visits as part of the training and provided incentives to trainers ($30) as a result. The 1985 project in The Gambia used health workers to teach mothers at home about ORT and awarded lottery prizes for happy babies (rice, sugar and soap). The skills training component of the 1984 campaign in Honduras involved 1-on-1 instruction. A radio course on breastfeeding, sibling school instruction, and an illustrated health care manual. Its consequences were games and prizes in calls to radio programs, free calendars, key chains, t-shirts and a trip to Tegucigalpa. The only program limited to a skills training component was the campaign in South India in 1976. The training involved training nurses to instruct mothers on diarrhea management. A stumbling block in all campaigns was that ORT does not appear to improve diarrhea and vomiting immediately. Those campaigns that had a skills training component were more effective than those that did not. Behavior analysts could contribute to ORT campaigns by developing simple and effective training programs and developing inexpensive and effective mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of such campaigns.",0,0,

333,Childhood Obesity Screening and Treatment Practices of Pediatric Health Care Providers,"This study evaluated clinicians' childhood obesity screening and treatment practices. A 26-question survey was delivered to pediatric providers in person or by mail, email, or fax throughout Louisiana. Fifty-seven providers completed the survey, the majority in primary care clinics. Five providers met at least four of the seven clinical guidelines, but no provider met all guidelines. While 88% of providers screened for obesity, 7% met guidelines for referring obese patients to weight management services. Six providers offered interventions that included all recommended components (ie, diet, physical activity, and behavioral counseling). One intervention met intensity guidelines (ie, >25 hours delivered over at least six months). Barriers to offering services included lack of reimbursement and poor compliance by families. Solutions to overcome treatment barriers must be identified to increase the provision of health care services for children with obesity.",0,0,
334,Childhood tonsillectomy: who is referred and what treatment options are taken? Baseline findings from the Northern England and Scotland Study of Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy in Children (NESSTAC),"BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomies are performed frequently, but there are variations in tonsillectomy rates. Clinicians use guidelines, but the complex psychosocial influences on childhood tonsillectomy include anecdotal evidence of parental enthusiasm. Studies indicate that undergoing the preferred treatment improves outcome. Despite the enthusiasm with which tonsillectomy is offered and requested, there is little evidence of its effectiveness. This resulted in a randomized controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy in children with recurrent sore throats. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of children entering the randomized trial with those enrolled in a parallel, nonrandomized study to establish trends in patient referral and treatment preferences. DESIGN: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial with a preferably nonrandomized parallel study comparing surgical intervention with medical treatment in children aged 4 to 15 years with recurrent sore throats referred to five secondary care otolaryngology departments located in the north of England or in the central west. Scotland. RESULTS: The centers evaluated 1546 children"";"" 21% were not eligible for tonsillectomy. Among older children (8-15 years), girls were significantly more likely to be referred to secondary care. Of 1,015 eligible children, 268 (28.2%) agreed to be randomized, while 461 (45.4%) agreed to the nonrandomized, parallel preference study, with a strong preference for tonsillectomy. Participants who reported that progress in school had been hampered or with more experience of persistent sore throat were more likely to seek tonsillectomy. Referred boys were more likely than girls to opt for medical treatment. Socioeconomic data showed no effect. CONCLUSION: Preference for tonsillectomy reflects educational impact and recent experience, rather than age or socioeconomic status.",0,0,
335,Children in taxis: an opportunity for pediatricians and emergency physicians to save lives?,"OBJECTIVE: Child safety devices (infant seats, booster seats, and seat belts) are effective in reducing the risk of injury"";"" however, there is still a pattern of non-use or misuse of car seats by parents. The objective of this study was to assess the level of awareness and compliance with safety seat guidelines in cars and private taxis by parents with children presenting for emergency care. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two caregivers of children (age range, 2 weeks to 19 years) presenting for care at the pediatric emergency department of an urban teaching hospital were contacted to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire, and 225 participated. The questionnaire included knowledge, attitude, and behavior questions about protective equipment for children of various ages. RESULTS: Eleven (47.8%) of 23 children 1 year of age and younger were reported to use infant seats frequently or always while traveling in private cars, compared to 8 (22.2%) of 36 children 1 year of age or less than were reported to use them while traveling in private cars. taxis (P < 0.05). Seventeen (85%) of 20 children over 8 years of age were reported to have used seat belts frequently or always in private cars versus 10 (41.7%) of 24 in taxis (P < 0.01). One hundred fifty-four (99.3%) of 155 subjects were aware of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommended position for their child's car seat. Most parents believed in the effectiveness of child safety seats in preventing vehicle injuries and reported that they would be more likely to use safety devices if they received information about their use in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this survey show that the use of car seats is lower in taxis than in private cars and that this is attributable to the inconvenience of taking these seats to and from the taxi rather than to financial considerations or lack of knowledge about its effectiveness. Strategies should be sought to increase the availability of child safety devices in taxis. The emergency department, as well as the pediatrician's office or clinic, can be a place for an educational intervention for parents and caregivers about the safety of children as passengers.",0,0,

337,Cognitive performance and selective attention of children after recent community violence,"Research has shown strong relationships between community violence and psychopathology, but relatively little is known about the ways in which community violence can affect cognitive performance and attention. The present study estimates the effects of police-reported community violence on the performance of 359 urban children on a computerized neuropsychological task using a fixed-effects quasi-experimental design. Living in close proximity to a recent violent crime predicted faster but marginally less accurate task performance for the full sample, evolutionarily adaptive patterns of ""vigilant"" attention (i.e., less attention toward positive stimuli, more attention toward negative stimuli) for children who reported low trait anxiety and potentially maladaptive patterns of ""avoidant"" attention for highly anxious children. These results suggest that community violence may directly affect children's cognitive performance and, at the same time, have different (and potentially orthogonal) impacts on care delivery depending on children's levels of biobehavioral risk. Implications for mental health and sociological research are discussed.",0,0,
338,Chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Psychostimulants are the first line of treatment for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. Evidence suggests that up to 30% of prescription stimulant medications fail to show clinically significant results. Also, many children and teens experience side effects from these medications. As a result, parents seek alternative interventions for their children. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies for behavioral disorders such as AD/HD are on the rise and as many as 68% of parents have sought help from alternative practitioners, including chiropractors. OBJECTIVE: The review seeks to answer the question of whether chiropractic care can reduce symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. METHODS: Electronic databases (Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Index to Chiropractic Literature) were searched from inception to July 2009 looking for studies in English for chiropractic care. and AD/HD. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the selected studies. All randomized controlled trials were assessed using the Jadad score and a checklist developed from the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Trial Reporting) guidelines. RESULTS: The search returned 58 citations of which 22 were intervention studies. Of these, only three studies were identified for pediatric and adolescent cohorts with AD/HD. The methodological quality was poor and none of the studies qualified according to the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To date there is insufficient evidence to assess the efficacy of chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. The claim that chiropractic care improves pediatric and adolescent AD/HD is supported by only low levels of scientific evidence. In the interest of pediatric and adolescent health, if chiropractic care for AD/HD is to continue, more rigorous scientific research must be conducted to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment. RCTs of adequate size using clinically relevant outcomes and standardized measures are needed to examine the effectiveness of chiropractic care versus no treatment/placebo control or standard care (pharmacological and psychosocial care) to determine whether chiropractic care is an effective alternative intervention. for pediatric and adolescent patients.

METHODS: We used a multi-stage process combining consensus methodology and literature reviews to arrive at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Top 5 list. Rheumatologists from various practice settings generated items using the Delphi method. Items with high content agreement and high perceived prevalence advanced to a survey of ACR members, comprising >90% of the US rheumatology workforce. To increase response rate, a nested random sample of 390 rheumatologists received a more intensive survey follow-up. Samples were pooled and weighting procedures applied to ensure generalizability. Items with high ratings underwent a literature review. The working group then selected and formulated the final elements. RESULTS: One hundred and five unique items were proposed and reduced to 22 items during Delphi rounds. A total of 1,052 rheumatologists (17% of those contacted) participated in the member survey, while 33% of those in the nested random sample participated"";"" The characteristics of the respondents were similar in both samples. Based on the survey results and available scientific evidence, 5 items (related to antinuclear antibodies, Lyme disease, MRI, bone absorptiometry, and biological therapy for rheumatoid arthritis) were selected for inclusion.

This initiative, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, encourages conversations between doctors and patients about treatments and tests that may be abused, unnecessary, or potentially harmful. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Potential items were initially compiled through an online survey. They were then evaluated and refined by a task force representing the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Councils on Clinical Affairs and Quality, Health Policy, and Government Relations. Literature reviews were conducted to support the recommendation and narrative, as well as to provide references for each item. The ASTRO board of directors then selected a final list of 5 items. RESULTS: ASTRO's 5 recommendations for the Choosing Wisely campaign are as follows: (1) Do not initiate whole breast radiation therapy as part of breast conservation therapy in women >/= 50 years of age with invasive breast cancer stage without considering treatment schedules""; (2) do not initiate management of low-risk prostate cancer without discussing active surveillance; (3) do not routinely use extended fractionation schemes (>10 fractions) for palliation of metastases bone; (4) not routinely recommend proton beam therapy for prostate cancer outside of a clinical trial or prospective registry;"" and (5) does not routinely use intensity-modulated radiation therapy to deliver radiation therapy to the whole breast as part of breast-conserving therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ASTRO list for the Choosing Wisely campaign highlights radiation oncology interventions that should be discussed between physicians and patients prior to initiation of treatment. These 5 elements provide opportunities to offer higher quality and less expensive care.",0,0,
342,Chronic care model and shared care in diabetes: randomized trial of an electronic decision support system.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of a specialized telemedicine intervention to improve diabetes care using the chronic care model (CCM). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS As part of the CCM, 97 primary care physicians at 6 primary care practices in Rochester, MN, referred 639 patients to an on-site diabetes educator between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003. At first referral, clinicians were centrally randomized to receive either a telemedicine intervention (specialized advice and evidence-based messaging on cardiovascular risk medication management) or no intervention, keeping outcome assessors and data analysts blinded. to group assignment. After each subsequent clinical encounter, the endocrinologists reviewed a summary of the patient's electronic medical record and provided management recommendations and supporting evidence to the intervening physicians via email. Control physicians received email with regular generic information on cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Outcome measures included diabetes care processes (diabetes testing), outcomes (metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, estimated risk of coronary artery disease), and costs to the patient (payer perspective). RESULTS During the intervention, 951 (70%) of the 1361 endocrinology reviews detected performance gaps and resulted in a message; primary care physicians reported using 49% of messages in patient care. With a median follow-up of 21 months, the intervention, compared with control, did not significantly improve metabolic outcomes or reduce the estimated risk of coronary artery disease (adjusted mean difference, -1%; 95% confidence interval , -19%). to 17%). The intervention group incurred lower costs (p = 0.02), but not diabetes-related costs. CONCLUSION Specialized telemedicine did not significantly improve the value of CCM in primary care.",0,1,
343,Chronic disease health risk behaviors among people with a mental illness,"OBJECTIVE: Among people with a mental illness, modifiable health risk behaviors contribute substantially to increased morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. This study examined the prevalence of and interest in changing such behaviors among clients of community mental health services in Australia. METHOD: A telephone interview was conducted with Australian community mental health service clients. Participants reported engaging in four health risk behaviors: tobacco smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Participants were classified as at risk based on Australian national guidelines. At-risk participants were asked if they were considering improving their health risk behavior in the next month. The association between psychiatric diagnosis and risk and interest in improving health risk behaviors was examined. RESULTS: The prevalence of risk was higher for inadequate consumption of vegetables (78.3%), followed by inadequate consumption of fruits (60%), smoking (50.7%), physical inactivity (46.8%), risk of short-term alcohol (40.3%) and chronic alcoholism risk (35.3%). Most of the participants at risk were considering improving their health risk behaviors due to smoking, physical inactivity and inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables (65.1%, 71.1% and 53.3%, respectively) . After adjusting for demographic factors, no diagnostic category was associated with risk for any behavior. Those with a diagnosis of depression were more likely to be interested in quitting smoking and increasing physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of diagnosis, a high prevalence of chronic disease health risk behaviors was identified, and many participants expressed interest in improving these behaviors. Such findings reinforce recommendations that mental health clinicians routinely provide preventive care that addresses clients' chronic disease risks.

344,Competence network in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are appearing intermittently, often chronic diseases that mainly affect young people in their 20s and 30s, influencing their quality of life and socioeconomic efficiency. The triggers for the development of IBD are not fully understood: in addition to environmental factors, there is clear evidence of additional genetic factors influencing disease risk and the pattern of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. Pathophysiological discoveries are leading to new therapeutic opportunities being conducted in large clinical trials with the primary involvement of the IBD Competency Network. The network's scattered structure comprising university and non-university hospitals and laboratories, the self-help organization DCCV, and its vertical cooperation with general practitioners nationwide provides the opportunity to describe diseases from the point of view of the scientist and the physician simultaneously. Therefore, the IBD Competence Network provides the basis for the standardized integration of patient information, for the development of guidelines and the establishment of a quality management system thus leading to improved scientific and clinical research.",0,0,
345,Smoking Prevalence Among HIV-Positive Adults Compared to the General Adult Population in the United States,"Background: The negative health effects of smoking and HIV infection are synergistic. Objective: To compare the current prevalence of smoking and smoking cessation among adults with HIV receiving medical care and adults in the general population. Design: Nationally representative cross-sectional surveys. Setting: United States. Patients: 4,217 adults with HIV who participated in the Medical Monitoring Project and 27,731 U.S. adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey in 2009. Measurements: Primary exposure was smoking. Outcome measures were weighted smoking prevalence and quit rate (ratio of former smokers to the sum of former and current smokers). Results: Of the estimated 419,945 HIV-positive adults who received medical care, 42.4% (95% CI, 39.7% 45.1%) were current cigarette smokers, 20.3% (CI, 18.6% to 22.1%) were former smokers, and 37.3% (CI, 34.9% to 39.6%) had never smoked. Compared with the US adult population, in which an estimated 20.6% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2009, adults with HIV were almost twice as likely to smoke (adjusted prevalence difference, 17 .0 percentage points [CI, 14.0 to 20.1 percentage points]), but were less likely to quit (quit rate, 32.4% vs. 51.7%). Among adults with HIV, factors independently associated with higher smoking prevalence were older age, non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black race, lower educational level, poverty, homelessness, incarceration, use of substances, excessive alcohol consumption, depression and not achieving a suppressed HIV viral load. Limitation: cross-sectional design with some generalization limitations. Conclusion: Adults with HIV were more likely to smoke and less likely to quit than the general adult population. Tobacco screening and cessation strategies are important considerations as part of routine HIV care.",0,0,

347,Civil commitment of the anorexic patient,"Involuntary engagement appears to be an infrequently used intervention with anorexic patients, in part due to clinicians' uncertainty about its applicability to this population. Unlike overtly suicidal patients, anorexic patients do not usually express an intention to harm themselves, although their actions may result in serious harm. Examination of the language of civil commitment statutes, however, suggests that when anorexic patients' behavior endangers their lives, they will generally be subject to severe disability standards. This appears to be consistent with the practices of experts in the treatment of anorexia and also with practices in other countries. Involuntary hospitalization should be used as an approach of last resort, when patients refuse voluntary hospitalization and their physical safety is at risk. In addition, civil hospitalization should probably also be limited to circumstances in which hospitalization is likely to result in therapeutic benefit. Many seriously ill anorexic patients will lack the competence to make treatment decisions for themselves, allowing for involuntary feeding and other procedures, if necessary. Civil commitment is a tool that can be legitimately used in emergent situations with anorexic patients.",0,0,
348,Classifications in the field of mental health,"For the first time in the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), the chapter on mental disorders contained brief glossary definitions for each category. A number of changes in attitudes and policies at the international and national levels, in particular the reorientation of mental health programs to include behavioral and psychosocial problems, came at an opportune time and had a positive influence on the development of proposals for the chapter. about mental and mental health. behavioral disorders in the Tenth Revision (ICD-10). This, in turn, enabled the WHO to undertake an intensive and extensive assessment of the international needs in the classification of mental disorders and, where the situation was not unequivocal, to organize field tests to provide the empirical data necessary for the solution of the problem. issue. The result is a series of compatible classifications of mental and behavioral disorders based on ICD-10. The first, developed primarily as a reference tool for statistical purposes, will be included in ICD-10 with brief definitions in the glossary, as was the case with ICD-9. Further versions for practicing physicians (with improved glossary definitions followed by diagnostic guidelines) will be published for research (with full definitions, diagnostic guidelines, and diagnostic criteria)""; for use in providing services to the mentally ill;"" and for use in general (primary) health care. A multiaxial classification of mental disorders in children will also be performed to identify the clinical syndrome, resulting disability, and environmental factors. These versions tailored to the needs of different groups working in the mental health field are expected to result in further improvements in communications between those responsible for service delivery and care.",0,0,
349,Classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy for reducing depressive symptoms in high-risk adolescents: a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy with attention control and usual school provision for adolescents at high risk of depression. DESIGN Three-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial. SETTING Eight UK secondary schools. PARTICIPANTS Adolescents (n=5030) from 12 to 16 years old from the groups of 8 to 11 years old. The year groups were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to cognitive behavioral therapy, attention management, or usual school provision. The allocation was balanced by school, year, number of students and classes, frequency of lessons, and schedule. Participants were not blinded to treatment assignment. INTERVENTIONS Cognitive behavioral therapy, attention management, and usual school disposition provided in class to all eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Results were collected using a self-completed questionnaire administered by the investigators. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression assessed at 12 months using the short mood and feelings questionnaire among those identified at baseline as being at high risk for depression. Secondary outcomes included negative thoughts, self-esteem, and anxiety. Analyzes were by intention to treat and took into account the pooled nature of the design. RESULTS: 1064 (21.2%) adolescents were identified as being at high risk for depression: 392 in the classroom cognitive behavioral therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the usual school provision arm. At 12 months, adjusted mean scores on the Brief Mood and Feelings Questionnaire did not differ for cognitive behavioral therapy versus attention control (-0.63, 95% confidence interval: -1, 85 to 0.58, P = 0.41) or for cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual school provision ( 0.97, -0.20 to 2.15, P = 0.12). CONCLUSION In adolescents with depressive symptoms, results were similar for attention control, usual school offerings, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs may result in increased self-awareness and reporting of depressive symptoms, but should not be undertaken without further evaluation and investigation.

DESIGN Single-blind, parallel group, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial. SCENARIO 35 general practices in the South of England between October 2008 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS Patients aged 18 years or older with chronic dizziness (mean duration > five years) not attributable to non-vestibular causes (confirmed by a general practitioner) and who could aggravated by movement of the head (confirmed by the patient). INTERVENTIONS Participants randomized to receive usual medical care, booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation only, or booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation with telephone support. For the booklet approach, participants received self-management booklets that provide comprehensive advice on performing vestibular rehabilitation exercises at home every day for up to 12 weeks and using cognitive behavioral techniques to promote positive beliefs and adherence. to treatment. Participants receiving telephone support were offered up to three short sessions of structured support by a vestibular therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Abbreviated Vertigo Symptom Scale and total health costs related to dizziness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS Of 337 randomized participants, 276 (82%) completed all clinical measures at the primary endpoint, 12 weeks, and 263 (78%) at 1-year follow-up. We analyzed clinical effectiveness on an intention-to-treat basis, using analysis of covariance to compare groups after intervention, controlling for baseline symptom scores. At 12 weeks, Vertigo Symptom Scale scores in the telephone support group did not differ significantly from those in the usual care group (adjusted mean difference -1.79 (95% confidence interval -3, 69 to 0.11), p = 0.064). At one year, both intervention groups improved significantly relative to usual care (telephone support -2.52 (-4.52 to -0.51), P=0.014""; booklet only -2.43 (-4.27 α -0.60), P=0.010).Analysis of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that both interventions were highly cost-effective, with very low QALY values, the booklet-only approach was more likely to be cost-effective, but the approach with additional telephone support was more likely to be profitable at QALY values above £1,200 (£1,488; ""$1,932""). Using the telephone assisted booklet approach, five (3 to 12) patients would need to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year. CONCLUSIONS Booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation for chronic dizziness is a simple and cost-effective means of improving patient-reported outcomes in primary care.

353,Clinical characteristics associated with the prescription of SSRI drugs in adolescents with unipolar major depression,"Unipolar major depressions (MD) emerge markedly during adolescence. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom recommends psychological therapies, accompanied by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prescribed only in severe cases. Here, we seek to determine the scope and rationale for prescribing SSRIs in adolescents with MD before entering a randomized clinical trial. SSRI prescription, along with its clinical characteristics, was determined in 465 adolescent MD patients prior to receiving standardized psychological therapy as part of the Improving mood with psychoanalytic and cognitive therapies (IMPACT) clinical trial. In total, 88 (19%) had been prescribed antidepressants before psychological treatment. The clinical correlates varied by gender: respectively, severity of depression in boys and self-injurious behaviors in girls. Prescribing also differed between clinical research centers. Doctors consider the severity of depression in children as an indicator for the prescription of antidepressants. Self-harm in girls appears to be used as a prescription aid which is inconsistent with past and current revised UK NICE guidelines.",0,0,

PARTICIPANTS 2749 women assigned to intervention, 1335 to control. INTERVENTION Health visitors (n=89 63 groups) were trained to identify depressive symptoms six to eight weeks after birth using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and clinical assessment, and were also trained to provide Psychologically informed sessions based on cognitive behavioral or person-centered principles for one hour a week for eight weeks. Health visitors in the control group (n=49 38 groups) provided usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale score > or = 12 at six months. Secondary outcomes were the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, clinical outcomes on the Routine Assessment Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the SF-12, and scores on the parental stress index (PSI-SF) at six, 12, 18 months. RESULTS: 4084 eligible women consented and 595 women had a 6-week EPDS score > or = 12. Of these, 418 had available EPDS scores at 6 weeks and 6 months. At six months, 34% of women (93/271) in the intervention group and 46% (67/147) in the control group had an EPDS score > or = 12. The odds ratio for score > or = 12 at six months was 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.97, P = 0.036) for women in the intervention group compared with women in the control group .

356,Global clinical measures of dementia. Position Paper of the International Task Force on Harmonization of Guidelines on Medicines for Dementia,"Below is the report of the committee working on global clinical measures for dementia drug guidelines. Concepts involved in global scales, distinctions between change and severity scales, advantages and disadvantages of structured interviews and anchoring of change scores are discussed, and selected existing clinical global scales are described. In addition, the committee evaluated the usefulness of global scales in clinical trials of drugs for dementia. There was consensus among the members of the working group on the following: (1) The global clinical scales are based on interviews"";"" in most cases, they include information obtained from caregivers and directly from patients, but may be based solely on information from the subject. (2) Physicians' global ratings are intended to assess clinically significant change based on a multidimensional clinical assessment and take into account the clinical heterogeneity of dementia by assessing at least cognition, behavior, and functioning. (3) There are two distinct types of clinical global measures: (a) physician interview-based global severity scales, which generally incorporate classification by stage or severity of illness, and (b) physician interview-based global change scales. physicians, which incorporate global assessment ratings of clinical change. The committee was unable to reach a consensus on whether global scales should be required in phase II and phase III clinical trials, or whether other specific assessments, such as well-designed activities of daily living, cognition, and behavioral measures, when used in appropriate combinations. , replace the global as assessments of clinical significance.",0,0,
357,Clinical governance in the management of induction of labor,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the dissemination of explicit guidelines, developed in consensus with stakeholders, for induction of labor (IOL) processes, results in a reduction in variability in clinical practice. DESIGN: A prospective behavior modification intervention study. STUDY LOCATION AND DURATION: The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, between January 1 and August 31, 2002. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a total of 142 conveniently selected women , submitted to IOL, pre-identified quality assessment indicators were measured. After data collection from an initial 71 women (pre-intervention group), mutually agreed guidelines for clinical practice were disseminated, over a period of time, among consultants, residents, and nurses. These indicators were measured again in 71 subsequent women (post-intervention group) to assess the magnitude of residual nonconformities in these processes. RESULTS: After behavior modification interventions, nonconformities in consultants and resident-dependent processes, such as timely review of patients by consultants (72% vs. 1.4%, p-value < 0, 0001), documentation of IOL indication (66.2 vs. 16.9%, p-value <0.0001), method of IOL induction (56.3 vs. 28.2%, p-value 0.0001) and pre-IOL Bishop score calculation (38.0 vs. 4.2%, p-value < 0.0001) were significantly reduced.

METHODS: Participants were providers who cared for 1017 patients with hypertension uncontrolled with a single antihypertensive agent within Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were ordered into a framework to account for variation in guideline adaptation. RESULTS: The 184 providers' negative responses to the computer alerts contained explanations for not changing the patient's treatment"";"" 76 responses to the alerts were positive, that is, the provider was going to change the antihypertensive regimen. Negative responses were categorized as: practice inertia (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). ). . Most of the 135 providers classified as having practice inertia stated, ""Continue current medications and I'll discuss this at the next visit."" The median number of days to the next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).

360,Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual: A Quality-Based Approach to Translating Evidence into Action,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. Well-crafted guidance promotes quality by reducing variations in care, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective or potentially harmful interventions. Despite the plethora of published guidelines, the methodology is often poorly defined and varies greatly within and between organizations. PURPOSE: This manual describes the principles and practices successfully used by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to produce evidence-based, quality-based guidelines using an efficient and transparent methodology for action-ready recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. . From conception to completion in 12 months, the development process emphasizes a logical sequence of key action statements supported by extension text, evidence profiles, and grades of recommendation that link action to evidence. CONCLUSIONS: As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key metric of quality healthcare, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must learn to understand what guidelines are and are not, and how they are best used to improve care. The information in this manual should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.",0,0,
361,Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Discharge (Update),"OBJECTIVE: This update of a 2004 guideline developed jointly by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians provides evidence-based recommendations for managing otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the previous guideline include the addition of consumer advocates to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews and 49 randomized controlled trials, increased emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME. PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations for implementing these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are more susceptible to the sequelae of developing OME, and educate clinicians and patients about the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits of OME. medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants ). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language assessment, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient of the guideline is a child aged 2 months to 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and applies to any setting in which OME is identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients 12 years of age. ACTION STATEMENTS: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child""; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess the OME in a child with ear pain, hearing loss, or both; (3) you should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempted) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) you should manage the child with OME not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from date of stroke onset (if known) or 3 months from date of diagnosis (if onset unknown); (5) should recommend not use intranasal or systemic steroids to treat OME, (6) should recommend against the use of systemic antibiotic steroids for the treatment of OME, and (7) should recommend against the use of antihistamines, decongestants, or both to treat OME. mothers of infants with OME who have failed newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure normal hearing when OME resolves and to exclude underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) must determine whether a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems due to middle ear effusion due to early sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) must screen children at risk for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and between 12 and 18 months of age (if diagnosed at risk before this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that can be attributed to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or discomfort in the ears; (5) should educate children with OME and their families about the natural history of OME, the need for follow-up, and possible sequelae; (6) must obtain age-appropriate hearing screening if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reassess, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when performing surgery for OME in a child ≥ 4 years of age;"" and (11) should document resolution of OME, hearing improvement, or quality improvement of life when treating a child with OME.",0,0,
362,Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus,"OBJECTIVE: Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potentially significant effect on quality of life, there are no evidence-based multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to help clinicians with management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or more), often negatively affecting a patient's quality of life. The target audience for the guideline is any clinician, including non-physicians, involved in the management of patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (over 18 years of age) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome. PURPOSE: The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guide provides clinicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social effects of persistent and bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including the selection and timing of diagnostic tests and referral to specialists to identify possible underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the assessment and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the assessment and measurement of the effect of tinnitus, and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life for tinnitus sufferers. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with non-bothersome tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against head and neck imaging in patients with tinnitus, specifically to assess tinnitus that is not localized to one ear, is not pulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurological abnormalities. or asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a specific history and physical examination in the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected primary tinnitus to identify conditions that, if promptly identified and managed, may alleviate the tinnitus."" ; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiological examination in patients with unilateral, persistent (>/= 6 months), or associated tinnitus with hearing difficulties; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with persistent symptoms ( >/= 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions of natural history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent and bothersome tinnitus about management strategies; (e) recommend hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent and bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with tinni your persistent and annoying. against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic medications for the routine treatment of patients with persistent and bothersome tinnitus; (b) Ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc, or other dietary supplements for the treatment of patients with persistent and bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent and bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: clinicians can (a) obtain an initial comprehensive audiological examination in patients presenting with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status)"" and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent tinnitus bothersome tinnitus The development group did not provide any recommendations regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent and bothersome tinnitus.",0,0,
363,Clinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children,"OBJECTIVE: Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually on children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children aged 1 to 18 years who are being considered for tonsillectomy. Additionally, this guide is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children ages 1 to 18 who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with an evidence-based guide to identify children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary goals are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, to emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, to improve counseling and education for families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, to highlight treatment options management for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. RESULTS: The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against physicians routinely giving or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent strep throat if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years ""; (2) evaluate the child with recurrent strep throat who does not meet the criteria for statement 2 to modify factors that may nevertheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include, but are not limited to, allergy/intolerance to multiple antibiotics , periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or a history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) ask caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, bed-wetting, and behavioral problems; (4) advise carers about tonsillectomy as a means of improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have enlarged tonsils and disordered breathing; (5) advise caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require additional treatment; (6) advocate for post-tonsillectomy pain control and educate caregivers on the importance of pain management and reassessment;"" and (7) physicians performing tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage. tonsillectomy at least once a year The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent pharyngeal infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes a year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes a year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature >38.3 degrees C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.",0,0,
364,Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children,"OBJECTIVE: Tympanostomy tube insertion is the most common outpatient surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted due to persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in the management of children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or who are being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type. . PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and indications for surgery and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group extensively discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision-making and care for children with existing tubes. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute otorrhea with a tympanostomy tube. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration""; (2) clinicians should obtain a age-appropriate hearing screening if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or before surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer insertion of a bilateral tympanostomy tube to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reassess, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not received tympanostomy tubes until effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion panostomy in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have a mid-effusion in either ear at the time of evaluation for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of evaluation for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine whether a child with recurrent AOM or OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems due to otitis media due to underlying sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) perioperatively, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes about the expected duration of tube function, the recommended follow-up schedule, and screening for complications; (9) Physicians should not encourage routine and prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands;"" avoid swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) Physicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms likely to be attributed to OME, including but not limited to vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavior problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve rapidly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of the effusion for 3 months or more (chronic OME).",0,0,
365,Clinical practice guidelines for severe Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Although severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a prevalent, serious, and costly public health problem, few practical guidelines exist to help clinicians manage this disorder. METHODS: A search of English-language medical databases from 1996 to the present was conducted for articles related to the management of AD. The focus of this review was on studies that included patients with severe disease. Studies were evaluated considering subjects, trial design, analysis and results. Recommendations were based on the best available evidence. RESULTS: Severe AD can be reliably defined and diagnosed using measures of cognition, function, behavior, and global staging. Specific assessments would also include the caregiver's medical status, safety concerns, and health status. Specific management of the disease would include treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with nonpharmacologic behavioral and environmental approaches. Severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that are potentially dangerous to the patient, caregiver, and others in the environment can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, taking into account their increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. All pharmacological approaches require careful monitoring and regular periodic reassessments to determine if further treatment is necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines for the management of severe AD have the potential to improve the quality of life of the patient and their caregiver. More randomized controlled trials specifically targeting this phase of the disease are still urgently needed.",0,0,
366,Clinical practice guidelines to improve shared decision making on the use of assistive devices in home care: a pilot intervention study,"This study examines whether clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the introduction of assistive devices (ADs) in home care improve shared decision-making about the use of ADs and modify their sociocognitive correlates. Data were collected in an intervention study with a quasi-experimental design. Questionnaires were obtained from 116 home health nurses and home care workers and their 140 clients with disabilities. Significant differences between the intervention and control groups revealed that the implementation of CPGs improved the self-reported practice of home nurses and home care workers: the number of intervention methods they applied increased and the methods were applied with greater intensity. . Nurses' attitudes toward introducing AD into a shared decision-making process decreased in both the intervention and control groups over time. Client reports of caregivers' practice showed less agreement with caregivers' own reports. The complexity of the CPG and a significant time investment were reported as the main barriers to involving clients in shared decision making through the experimental CPG. However, CPGs hold promise for shared decision-making between formal caregivers and people with disabilities living in the community regarding the use of AD. The findings suggest that these CPGs can structure communication between caregiver and client, and can help caregivers facilitate clients' self-determination regarding coping with their disabilities.",0,0,
367,Clinical Practice Update: Expert Review of Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBT) are currently being evaluated or in clinical use in the United States. EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic diseases. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists on these therapies and provide practical advice on how to incorporate them into clinical practice. METHODS: The evidence reviewed in this paper is a distillation of a comprehensive search of several English-language databases and a hands-on review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting abstracts). Best Practice Tip 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Tip 2: EBTs can be used in severely obese patients as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They can also be used as a bridge to allow for unrelated procedures that cannot be performed due to weight limits (ie, orthopedic surgery, organ transplant). Best Practice Tip 3: Clinicians should use EBT as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, both in the active weight loss phase and in the maintenance phase. long term. Best Practice Tip 4: Physicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive assessment of medical conditions, co-morbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns contributing to their condition before enrolling patients in an EBT program. weight loss that includes EBT. Best Practice Tip 5: Physicians incorporating EBT into their clinical practice should prospectively follow-up patients to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities, and any related adverse outcomes. Poor responders should be identified and offered detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Tip 6: Physicians embarking on incorporating EBT into their clinical practice should have a comprehensive understanding of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a working knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies for obesity. Best Practice Tip 7: Institutions should establish specific guidelines that are applied consistently across disciplines for granting privileges in EBT that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill that a physician must achieve before being granted privileges to perform these procedures.",0,0,
368,Variation of clinical practice in reduced fetal movements,"BACKGROUND: Reduced fetal movements imply a risky pregnancy. This condition is present in a significant proportion of pregnancies, but both the quality of information and clinical care is variable. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All delivery units in Eastern Norway and Bergen have recorded all consultations for reduced fetal movements, as part of the international collaborative project ""Fetal Movement Intervention Assessment"" (Femina). Of 23,933 deliveries, 1,200 pregnancies were examined. In 1043 pregnancies the mother had spontaneously reported concerns about ""reduced fetal movements""; these were included in the analyses. Results are presented with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Asphyxia, death, growth restriction or delivery prematurity occurred in 19.6% (16.6-22.6%) of cases, varying between units from 9.1% to 26.5%. Standard procedures varied widely;"" ultrasonography was used in 39.0% to 98.6% and Doppler in 4.5% to 74.6% of cases. There was an association between the results and the procedures used. Women who waited 24 hours with reduced or absent movements before contacting medical care were at higher risk. Among those with absent movements, 47% (42-52%) had this risk behavior. INTERPRETATION: There is a need for improvements in the quality of information to pregnant women, as well as in the clinical management of affected pregnancies. This could have great health benefits. We propose new information and management guidelines.",0,0,
369,Clinical practice. Subsequent orthodontic complications caused by risk factors observed in the first years of life,"Primary prevention strategies for oral health are an essential public health priority. Pediatricians have frequent contact with families during routine preventive visits in the early years of a child's life and are in an ideal and unique position to advise families on the prevention of oral disease in their children. Primary prevention is always recommended in very young children, to promote positive outcomes during childhood and later adulthood. The knowledge that pediatricians acquire about orofacial growth can improve the implementation and eventual success of a preventive program. In view of the widespread lack of orthodontic knowledge among pediatricians, this article describes the most common and distinctive symptoms that frequently appear in the early stages of a child's development and are easily detectable by clinicians. It is difficult to define preventive strategies to avoid malocclusion due to its multifactorial origin. However, there are some recognized behaviors that should be discouraged to allow for ideal craniofacial development and some that require early orthodontic referral. The following disorders are easy to diagnose by the pediatrician or parents and represent conditions in which early intervention might be appropriate to prevent possible future orofacial dysfunction: different sucking habits that persist beyond 3 years of age, mouth breathing and significant deviations from the established norms for the eruption of teeth. Early referral to a pediatric dentist or orthodontist is suggested when any of these conditions are observed. In general, measures to prevent malocclusion should be based on providing good incentives to promote normal growth and development of the face and the elimination of possible interferences that could damage these processes.",0,0,
370,Clinical reminders attached to echocardiography reports of patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction increase beta-blocker use: a randomized trial.,"Background: Although ß-blockers are known to prolong survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, they are often underutilized. We hypothesized that a reminder attached to the echocardiography report would increase the use of ß-blockers in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Methods and Results: We randomized 1,546 consecutive patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <45% detected on echocardiography in 1 of 3 laboratories to a ß-blocker reminder or no reminder. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they died within 30 days of randomization (n=89), did not receive medications through the Veterans Affairs system after 30 days (n=180), or underwent echocardiography at >1 laboratory (n=6). The primary outcome was prescription of an oral ß-blocker between 1 and 9 months after randomization. The mean age of the 1271 patients included was 69 years; Sixty percent had a history of heart failure and 51% were receiving beta-blocker therapy at the time of echocardiography. More patients randomized to reminder received a subsequent ß-blocker prescription (74%, 458 of 621) compared with those randomized to no reminder (66%, 428 of 650; P = .002). The effect of the reminder was not significantly different for subgroups based on patient location (inpatient versus outpatient) or prior ß-blocker use. Conclusions: A reminder attached to the echocardiography report increased ß-blocker use in patients with systolic function. of the left ventricle depressed.",1,1,
371,Clinical research in interventional pain management techniques: the clinician's point of view,"Interventional pain management techniques are considered for patients whose pain is refractory to conventional treatment. According to evidence-based medicine (EBM) guidelines, the highest level of evidence about the efficacy and safety of a treatment is generated from high-quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. A randomized controlled trial is defined as an experiment that determines the influence of an intervention on the natural history of the disease, which means that the comparison group must receive a placebo, which is a sham intervention in the case of interventional techniques of pain management. The systematic review summarizes the results of the available information in a structured way. When randomized controlled trials are available, observational studies are often ruled out. As new information about a treatment becomes available, the perceived value may change, thus determining the survival time of clinical evidence. This survival time is no different when based on randomized or nonrandomized studies. Inclusion criteria are an important component of the randomized controlled trial and are designed to test a treatment in a homogeneous population of patients. Since interventional pain management techniques are primarily used for the treatment of spinal pain, it must be emphasized that there is no gold standard for diagnosis. This lack of validated standard diagnostic procedures is at the origin of different patient selection criteria, which makes the interpretation of the different randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses very difficult. Furthermore, extrapolation from randomized controlled trials with carefully selected patient populations to daily practice is a major problem. Randomized controlled trials in interventional pain management techniques are often shown to be underpowered, which can be attributed to the difficulty of motivating patients and referring physicians to participate in a trial in which there is a 50% chances of receiving a placebo or sham treatment for intractable pain. In addition, the validity of the sham intervention as a reflection of the natural course of the disease is questioned. It is stated that any new technique must prove to be at least as effective as the best available treatment option, which offers the possibility of comparing two groups, both receiving active treatment. The gold standard treatment may be pharmacological or a rehabilitation program (cognitive behavioral) in which case blinding becomes a problem. Large observational studies with a cohort or case-control design have been shown not to systematically overestimate the magnitude of associations between exposure and outcome compared with results from randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need for guidelines on the conduct of prospective cohort trials that should be designed to confirm or refute anecdotal findings from retrospective studies.",0,0,

373,Prediction of clinical risk of preeclampsia in nulliparous women: development of a model in an international prospective cohort,"OBJECTIVES To develop a predictive model for preeclampsia based on clinical risk factors for nulliparous women and to identify a subgroup at higher risk, in whom specialist referral might be indicated. DESIGN Prospective multicenter cohort. SETTING Five centers in Auckland, New Zealand""; Adelaide, Australia; Manchester and London, UK""; and Cork, Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS 3572 ""healthy"" nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy from a large international study"";"" data on pregnancy outcome were available for 3529 (99%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Pre-eclampsia defined as Ã¢â€°Â¥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure Ã¢â€°Â¥ 90 mm Hg, or both, on at least two occasions four hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation, but before the onset of labor or postpartum, with either proteinuria or any multisystem complication. Premature preeclampsia was defined as women with preeclampsia who gave birth before 37 (+0) weeks of gestation. In stepwise logistic regression, the comparison group were women without preeclampsia. RESULTS Of the 3,529 women, 186 (5.3%) developed preeclampsia, including 47 (1.3%) with premature preeclampsia. Clinical risk factors at 14-16 weeks' gestation were age, mean blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), family history of preeclampsia, family history of coronary heart disease, maternal birth weight, and vaginal bleeding for at least five days. Factors associated with reduced risk were a previous single miscarriage with the same partner, taking at least 12 months to conceive, high fruit intake, smoking, and alcohol use in the first trimester. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), under internal validation, was 0.71. The addition of uterine artery Doppler indices did not improve performance (internal validation AUC 0.71). A framework for referral to a specialist was developed based on a model-generated probability of preeclampsia of at least 15% or an abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveform in a subset of women with unique risk factors. Nine percent of nulliparous women would be referred for specialist opinion, of whom 21% would develop pre-eclampsia. The relative risk of developing pre-eclampsia and premature pre-eclampsia in women referred to a specialist compared with standard care was 5.5 and 12.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ability to predict preeclampsia in healthy nulliparous women using the clinical phenotype is modest and requires external validation in other populations. If validated, it could provide a personalized clinical risk profile for nulliparous women to which biomarkers could be added. Test record ACTRN12607000551493.",0,0,
374,Cluster randomized controlled trial of personalized interventions to improve the management of urinary tract infections in women and sore throat.,"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of tailored interventions to implement guidelines for female urinary tract infections and sore throat. Design: Pre-post trial, cluster randomized, unblinded. Setting: 142 general practices in Norway. Participants: 72 practices received interventions to implement urinary tract infection guidelines and 70 practices received interventions to implement sore throat guidelines, serving as controls for each other. 59 practices in the urinary tract infection group and 61 practices in the sore throat group completed the study. Outcomes were measured in 16,939 visits for sore throat and 9,887 visits for urinary tract infection. Interventions: Interventions were developed to overcome identified barriers to implementing the guidelines. The main components of the personalized interventions were patient educational material, computer-based decision support and reminders, an increase in the telephone consultation fee, and interactive courses for general practitioners and practice assistants Main outcome measures: Changes in Rates of antibiotic use, laboratory tests, and telephone consultations Results: Patients in the sore throat group were 3% less likely to receive antibiotics after the intervention. Women with symptoms of urinary tract infection in the intervention group were 5.1% less likely to request a laboratory test. No significant differences were found between groups for the other outcomes. Large variation was found between the included practices in rates of antibiotic prescribing, use of laboratory tests and telephone consultations, and in the degree of change for all three outcomes. change of practice",0,1,
375,Cluster randomized trial of a multifaceted primary care decision support intervention for hereditary breast cancer risk.,"Bottom. GPs are increasingly expected to meet the needs of patients concerned about their risk of hereditary breast cancer, but may lack the skills or confidence to use complex management guidelines. We developed a multifaceted, evidence-based intervention aimed at promoting confidence and skills in this area. Goal. To assess the effectiveness of intervention in improving GP confidence in managing patients concerned about genetic risk of breast cancer. Methods. Design. Cluster randomized controlled trial. Around. General practice in the Grampian region of Scotland. Subjects. GPs and patients referred for genetic counseling for breast cancer risk. The main measures. Self-reported confidence of GPs in four activities related to genetics""; referral rates of patients with high genetic risk""; and the referred patients' understanding of cancer risk factors. Results. No statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention and control arms in the primary or secondary outcomes. A possible effect of the intervention on the proportion of patients referred who were at high risk could not be ruled out. Only a small proportion of intervention physicians attended the educational session, were aware of the software, or used it in practice. Conclusions. We found no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention, probably reflecting barriers to its use in routine practice.",0,1,
376,Cluster Randomized Trial of a Multitiered Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Approach to Tailor VA Patient-Aligned Care Teams to the Needs of Women Veterans,"Background The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has embarked on a major initiative to transform care through the implementation of Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the concept of the patient-centered medical home (PCMH), PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness through the use of team-driven, patient-focused care. the patient. However, the initial implementation guidance did not consider how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of special populations, such as female veterans (WVs). The numerical minority of WVs in VA health care settings (approximately 7Â¨C8% of patrons) creates logistical challenges in providing comprehensive gender-sensitive care. The main objective of this study is to test an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach to tailor PACT to the needs of VMs, incorporating comprehensive primary care services and gender-specific care. in gender-sensitive settings, thereby accelerating the achievement of the PACT principles for women (Women's Health (WH)-PACT). Methods/Design EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel clinical research partnership that engages senior organizational leaders and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing new models of care in the context of prior evidence and local practical conditions, with researchers providing technical support, formative feedback and internship facilitation. In a 12-site cluster-randomized trial, we will assess the achievement of the WH-PACT model using surveys of patients, providers, staff, and practices, as well as graph-based and secondary administrative data analyses. We will explore the impacts of receiving WH-PACT care on quality of care and chronic disease prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experience of care, provider experience, utilization, and costs. Using mixed methods, we will assess ""before and after"" practice settings; we will document EBQI activities conducted at participating facilities and their relationship with provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; we will document WH-PACT implementation;"" and examine barriers/enablers to implementation of the EBQI-supported WH-PACT through a combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly narratives of formative progress and administrative data. Discussion The lack of comprehensive gender-sensitive care has demonstrated consequences for the technical quality and qualifications of care among VMs and may contribute to decisions to continue using or seek care elsewhere under the Affordable Care Act We hypothesize that tailoring PACT implementation through EBQI can improve the experience and quality of care on many levels.",0,1,
377,Cluster randomized trials for pharmacy practice research,"Introduction Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are now the gold standard in health services research, including pharmacy-based interventions. Studies of behavior, epidemiology, lifestyle modifications, educational programs, and health care models are using the strengths of randomized cluster analysis. Methodology The key property of CRTs is the unit of randomization (groups), which may be different from the unit of analysis (individual). The size of the sample of subjects and, ideally, the number of clusters is determined by the ratio of between-cluster and within-cluster variability. The correlation between participants recruited from the same group is known as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Generally, having more clusters with smaller ICC values will lead to smaller sample sizes. When selecting groups, stratification before randomization may be helpful in minimizing imbalances between study arms. Participant recruitment methods may differ from other types of randomized trials, as a behavioral intervention cannot always be blinded. When to use CRT can produce results that are relevant to making ""real world"" decisions. CRTs are often used in nontherapeutic intervention studies (eg, change in practice guidelines). The advantages of CRT design in pharmaceutical research have been to avoid contamination and generalization of results. A large CRT that studied collaborative physician-pharmacist management of hypertension is used as an example of a CRT in this manuscript. The trial, titled Collaboration Between Pharmacists and Physicians to Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION), was implemented in primary care practices in the United States for hypertensive patients. Limitations Limitations of the CRT design include the need for a large number of clusters, high costs, increased training, increased monitoring, and statistical complexity.",0,0,
378,Cluster randomized controlled trial of computer-based decision support for selecting long-term antithrombotic therapy after acute ischemic stroke.,"Background: Identifying appropriate long-term antithrombotic therapy after acute ischemic stroke is a challenging area in which computer-based decision support can help. Objective: To assess the influence on prescribing practice of a computer-based decision support system (CDSS) that provided patient-specific estimates of expected rates of vascular ischemic and hemorrhagic events under each potential antithrombotic therapy. Design: cluster randomized controlled trial. Methods: We recruited patients presenting for a first investigation for ischemic stroke or TIA symptoms, excluding those with a poor prognosis or significant contraindication to anticoagulation. After observation of routine prescribing practice (6 months) at each hospital, centers were randomized for 6 months to control (observed routine practice) or intervention (observed practice while CDSS provided patient-specific information). We compared, between control and intervention centers, the risk reduction (estimated by the CDSS) in vascular ischemic and hemorrhagic events achieved by long-term antithrombotic therapy, and the proportions of subjects prescribed the therapy. optimum identified by the CDSS. Results: Sixteen hospitals recruited 1952 subjects. When the CDSS provided information, the mean relative risk reduction achieved by prescribing increased by 2.7 percentage units (95% CI -0.3 to 5.7) and the odds ratio for prescribing the optimal treatment was from 1.32 (0.83 to 1.80). Around 55% (5/9) of physicians believed that the CDSS had influenced their prescribing. Conclusions: Cluster randomized trials provide excellent frameworks for evaluating new methods of clinical management. Our CDSS was feasible to implement and acceptable to clinicians, but did not substantially influence antithrombotic drug prescribing practice after acute ischemic stroke.",1,1,

This article describes the rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of a comprehensive CVD risk reduction program delivered by nurse practitioner (NP)/community health worker (CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care for improve the proportion of patients in urban community health centers who reach the target levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c, and prescription of appropriate medications. METHODS: The COACH (Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health) trial is a randomized controlled trial in which patients at federally qualified community health centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: comprehensive intensive management of risk factors; CVD risk over one year by a NP/CHW Team or an enhanced usual care control group. RESULTS: A total of 3899 patients were evaluated for eligibility and 525 were randomized. The groups were comparable at baseline for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, with the exception of statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c.

Purpose: To determine the efficacy of CBT-i on daily measures of nighttime sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PubMed Clinical Queries from inception to March 31, 2015, supplemented by manual selection. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of face-to-face multimodal i-CBT compared with inactive comparators on nighttime sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. Studies of insomnia comorbid with medical, sleep, or psychiatric disorders were excluded. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed study characteristics, quality and data. The main outcome measures were sleep onset latency (SOL), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE%). Data Synthesis: Among 292 citations and 91 full-text articles reviewed, 20 studies (1162 participants [64% women"";"" mean age, 56 years]) were included. CBT-i approaches incorporated at least 3 of the following: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. At the post-treatment time point, SOL improved by 19.03 (95% CI, 14.12 to 23.93) minutes, WASO improved by 26.00 (CI, 15.48 to 36.52) minutes, TST improved by 7.61 (CI, ≥0.51 to 15.74) minutes and SE % improved by 9.91% (CI, 8.09% to 11.73%). The changes seemed to hold at later time points. No adverse outcomes were reported. Limitation: Narrow inclusion criteria limited applicability to patients with comorbid insomnia and other sleep problems, and the precision of estimates at later time points was less clear. Conclusion: i-CBT is an effective treatment for adults with chronic insomnia, with clinically significant effect sizes. Main funding source: none. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42012002863)",0,0,
382,Cognitive behavioral therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder in women,"Context The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among women who have served in the military, but no previous study has evaluated PTSD treatment in this population. Previous research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy is a particularly effective treatment for PTSD. Objective To compare prolonged exposure, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, with present-focused therapy, a supportive intervention, for the treatment of PTSD. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized controlled trial of female veterans (n=277) and active duty personnel (n=7) with PTSD recruited from 9 VA medical centers, 2 VA readjustment counseling centers, and 1 military hospital since August 2002 through October 2005. Intervention participants were randomly assigned to receive prolonged exposure (n = 141) or present-focused therapy (n = 143), administered according to standard protocols in 10 weekly 90-minute sessions. Main outcome measures Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity was the primary outcome. Comorbid symptoms, functioning, and quality of life were secondary outcomes. Blinded assessors collected data before and after treatment and at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Results Women who received prolonged exposure experienced a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms relative to women who received present-focused therapy (effect size, 0.27""; P = .03). was more likely than the present-focused therapy group to no longer meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD (41.0% vs. 27.8%; odds ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.96; P = .01) and achieving complete remission (15.2% vs. 6.9%; odds ratio, 2.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-5.37;"" P = .01). The effects were consistent over time in longitudinal analyses, although in cross-sectional analyses, most differences occurred immediately after treatment.

Extended exposure is feasible to implement in a variety of clinical settings.",0,0,
383,Cognitive behavioral therapy versus zopiclone for the treatment of chronic primary insomnia in older adults,"Context Insomnia is a common condition in older adults and is associated with a number of adverse medical, social, and psychological consequences. Previous research has suggested beneficial results of psychological and pharmacological treatments, but blinded placebo-controlled trials comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking. Objective To examine the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatment in older adults experiencing chronic primary insomnia. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 46 adults (mean age, 60.8 years; 22 women) with chronic primary insomnia conducted between January 2004 and December 2005 in a single outpatient of a norwegian university clinic for adults and elderly patients CBT intervention (sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy and relaxation; n = 18), sleep medication (7.5 mg zopiclone every night; n = 16) or placebo medication (n = 12). The total duration of treatment was 6 weeks, and the 2 active treatments were followed up for 6 months. Main outcome measures Clinical ambulatory polysomnographic data and sleep diary were used to determine total wake time, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slowness. undulating sleep (only assessed by polysomnography) at all 3 assessment points. Results CBT resulted in better short-term and long-term results compared to zopiclone on 3 of 4 outcome measures. For most outcomes, zopiclone did not differ from placebo. Participants receiving CBT improved their sleep efficiency from 81.4% at pretreatment to 90.1% at 6-month follow-up compared to a decrease from 82.3% to 81.9% in the zopiclone group. Participants in the CBT group spent significantly more time in slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) compared to those in other groups, and spent less time awake at night. Total sleep time was similar in the 3 groups; at 6 months, patients who received CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those who took zopiclone. Conclusion These results suggest that CBT-based interventions are superior to zopiclone treatment in both the short and long term. Long-term treatment of insomnia in older adults.",0,0,

In this article, we first outline a general outline of how cognitive change occurs and the constraints that may apply. We review a variety of individual factors, many of them biases themselves, that can be impediments to change. We then examine the main strategies that have been developed in the social sciences and in medicine to achieve the elimination of cognitive and affective bias, including the important concept of forced functions. The abundance and rich variety of approaches that exist in the literature and in individual clinical domains illustrate the difficulties inherent in achieving cognitive change and also the need for such interventions. Continuous cognitive elimination is arguably the most important characteristic of the critical thinker and well-calibrated mind. We describe three groups of suggested future interventions: educational strategies, workplace strategies, and strength functions. We emphasize the importance of environmental and contextual influences on the quality of individual decision-making and the need to address factors known to impair decision-maker calibration. We also emphasize the importance of the introduction of these concepts and the corollary development of training in critical thinking at the undergraduate level in medical education.",0,1,
385,Elimination of cognitive bias through sparklines in clinical data screens,"Sparklines, embedded contextual information graphics, can help reduce diagnostic errors by highlighting trends in data, simplifying cognitive tasks, and providing context for decision making. Examples applied to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, cardiac catheterization, and pediatric viral disease illustrate the concept. Sparklines are ideal in situations where limited textual data representations obfuscate interpretation, the chart helps interpret the data, and the chart guides decision making.",0,1,
386,Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in cancer patients,"Sleep-wake disorders, particularly insomnia, are among the most prevalent and distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients. As a result of extensive interdisciplinary research conducted since 2000, cognitive behavioral therapy is now considered the standard of care for the treatment of insomnia in the general population and has also been upgraded to ""probably effective"" in the Oncology Nursing Society Putting Evidence In practice weight of the category of evidence. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a multi-component psychological and behavioral treatment designed to eliminate factors that perpetuate insomnia. The most commonly used strategies are stimulus control, sleep restriction and relaxation therapies, paradoxical intention, sleep hygiene, and cognitive restructuring. Although this recommendation for the treatment of insomnia has been well publicized, the nursing literature has not effectively translated the theories and principles of cognitive behavioral therapy into practical guidelines or considerations for use by oncology nurses. and advanced professionals. This article attempts to demystify cognitive behavioral therapy and provide nurses at different levels of practice with a foundation from which to evaluate and potentially administer this promising intervention for insomnia.",0,0,
387,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy, imipramine, or its combination for panic disorder","Context Panic disorder (PD) can be treated with medication, psychosocial intervention, or both, but the relative and combined efficacies have not been impartially evaluated. Objective To assess whether pharmacological and psychosocial therapies for PD are each more effective than placebo, whether one treatment is more effective than the other, and whether combination therapy is more effective than either therapy alone. Design and setting A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 4 anxiety research clinics from May 1991 to April 1998. Patients A total of 312 PD patients were included in the analysis. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive imipramine, up to 300 mg/d, alone (n=83); cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) alone (n=77); placebo alone (n=24); CBT plus imipramine (n=65); or CBT plus placebo (n = 63). The patients were treated weekly for 3 months (acute phase); then responders were seen monthly for 6 months (maintenance phase) and then followed up for 6 months after treatment discontinuation. Main outcome measures Response to treatment based on Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) by treatment group Results Both imipramine and CBT were significantly superior to placebo for the treatment phase. acute treatment as assessed by PDSS (response rates for intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis, 45.8%, 48.7%, and 21.7%; P = .05 and P = .03, respectively ), but were not significantly different for CGI (48.2%, 53.9%, and 37.5%, respectively). After 6 months of maintenance, imipramine and CBT were significantly more effective than placebo for r Both the PDSS (response rates, 37.8%, 39.5%, and 13.0%, respectively; P = .02 for both) and the CGI (37.8%, 42.1%, and 13.0%, 0%, respectively). Among responders, imipramine produced a higher quality response. The acute response rate for combination therapy was 60.3% for PDSS and 64.1% for CGI; none were significantly different from the other groups. The 6-month maintenance response rate for combination therapy was 57.1% for PDSS (P=0.04 vs. CBT alone and P=0.03 vs. imipramine alone) and 56.3% for for CGI (P = 0.03 vs. imipramine alone), but not significantly better than CBT plus placebo in any analysis. Six months after treatment discontinuation, in ITT analysis, CGI response rates were 41.0% for CBT plus placebo, 31.9% for CBT alone, 19.7% for imipramine alone , 13% for placebo and 26.3% for CBT combined with imipramine. Conclusions The combination of imipramine and CBT appeared to confer a limited advantage acutely, but a more substantial advantage at the end of maintenance. Each treatment worked well immediately after treatment and during maintenance; CBT appeared durable at follow-up.",0,0,
388,Collaborative care for depressed patients with chronic medical conditions: a randomized trial in Puerto Rico,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined whether a collaborative care model for depression would improve clinical and functional outcomes for depressed patients with chronic general medical conditions in primary care practices in Puerto Rico. METHODS: A total of 179 primary care patients with major depression and chronic general medical conditions were randomly assigned to receive collaborative care or usual care. The collaborative care intervention involved increased collaboration between clinicians, mental health specialists, and care managers along with depression-specific treatment guidelines, patient education, and follow-up. In usual care, study staff informed the patient and physician of the diagnosis and encouraged patients to discuss treatment options with their physician. Depression severity was assessed with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist"";"" social functioning was assessed using the short 36-item form. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, collaborative care significantly reduced depressive symptoms and improved social functioning within six months of randomization. Integrating collaborative care into primary care practices greatly increased the use of mental health services by depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care significantly improved clinical symptoms and functional status of depressed patients with coexisting chronic general medical conditions receiving treatment for depression in primary care practices in Puerto Rico. These findings highlight the promise of the collaborative care model to strengthen the relationship between mental health and primary care services in Puerto Rico.",0,0,
389,Collaborative management to achieve treatment guidelines. Impact on depression in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention in patients with depression in primary care with the effectiveness of ""usual care"" by the primary care physician. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial among primary care patients with major depression or minor depression. PATIENTS: Over a 12-month period, a total of 217 primary care patients who were recognized as depressed by their primary care physicians and were willing to take antidepressant medication were randomized, with 91 patients meeting criteria for major depression and 126 of minor depression. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention patients received increased intensity and frequency of visits during the first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment (visits 1 and 3 with a primary care physician, visits 2 and 4 with a psychiatrist) and continued monitoring of adherence to medication regimens during the continuation and maintenance phases of treatment. Patient education at these visits was supplemented by videotaped and written material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included short-term (30 days) and long-term (90 days) use of antidepressant medication at guideline dosage levels, satisfaction with general depression care, and medication antidepressant, and reduction of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In patients with major depression, the intervention group had greater adherence than usual care controls to the appropriate dose of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more (75.5% vs. 50.0%""; P < 0.01), were more likely to rate the quality of care they received for depression as good to excellent (93.0% vs. 75.0%; P < .03), and were more likely to rate antidepressant medications as helping to help a lot (88.1% vs. 63.3%; P < Seventy-four percent of major depressive intervention patients showed an improvement of 50% or more on the symptoms checklist 90 depressive symptoms compared to 43.8% of controls (p < 0.01), and intervention patients also demonstrated significant improvement. over time compared to controls (P < 0.004).

A total of 7 primary care clinics in rural California included in the Healthy Eating and Active Living TeleHealth Community of Practice and 288 children seen at these clinics for well-child care participated in this prospective observational pre-post study. . The clinics participated in a virtual QI learning network for 9 months to implement best practices and exchange strategies for improvement. Post-intervention, documentation of weight assessment and counseling increased significantly. Children who received care from clinicians who led implementation of the intervention at their clinic showed significant improvements in nutrition and physical activity. Virtual QI learning networks in geographically dispersed clinics can significantly increase physician compliance with childhood obesity guidelines and improve access to recommended care for rural and underserved children.",0,0,
391,Collective Action for Implementation: A Realistic Assessment of Organizational Collaboration in Health Care,"Background Increasingly, it is suggested that translation gaps could be eradicated or reduced by bringing research users and producers closer together, a theory that remains largely unproven. This document reports on a national study to fill a gap in the evidence on the conditions, processes, and outcomes related to collaboration and implementation. Methods A longitudinal realist evaluation using multiple qualitative methods case studies was carried out with three Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research in Care (England). Data was collected in four rounds of theory development, refinement, and testing. More than 200 participants participated in semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations of events and meetings, and stakeholder engagement. A combined process of inductive and deductive data analysis focused on proposal refinement and iterative testing during rounds of data collection. Results The quality of existing relationships between higher education and the local health service, and views about whether the implementation was a collaborative act, created a dependency path. Where the implementation was perceived to be down and there was a lack of organizational connections, this resulted in a focus on knowledge production and transfer, rather than co-production. Collaboration architectures were counterproductive because they did not facilitate connectivity and emphasized professional and epistemic limits. A more distributed leadership was associated with a greater potential for participation. The creation of cross-border roles was the most visible investment in implementation, and credible people in these roles resulted in cross-border work, facilitation and direct impacts. The academic-practical gap played strongly as a context for the motivation to participate, in the sense that ""what's in it for me"" resulted in varying levels of engagement along a cooperation-collaboration continuum. Learning within and between collaborations was uneven depending on attention to evaluation. Conclusions These collaborations did not come out of nowhere and took time to learn and develop. Its life cycle began with its position of collaboration, knowledge and implementation. The most impactful attempts at collective action in implementation might be determined by the deliberate alignment of a number of characteristics, including critical relationships, vision, values, structures and processes, and views about the nature of collaboration and the implementation.",0,0,
392,Colonoscopy adoption for high-risk people with a family history of colorectal neoplasia: a multicenter randomized trial of personalized counseling versus standard information.,"BACKGROUND: Colonoscopic screening is recommended for first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) or colorectal adenomatous polyps (CAP) before the age of 60 years. This has the potential to reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality, but acceptance is currently inadequate. METHODS: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of standard information versus a personalized nurse-led intervention designed to promote acceptance of colonoscopy screening by siblings of patients with CRC or PDA. A randomized controlled trial was performed. Digestive surgeons and gastroenterologists recruited index patients who developed CRC or CAP before the age of 60 years. All index patients received standard screening information for their siblings, consistent with current guidelines. Centralized computerized randomization of the index patients resulted in all their siblings being assigned to the same group, intervention or control. The personalized intervention focused first on the index patient, to help him pass on information to his siblings. The nurse then provided the siblings with personalized information based on their responses to a self-questionnaire that explored health behaviors derived from psychosocial models of prevention. The brothers were then given a personalized information booklet to take to their regular doctor. The primary endpoint was the rate of documented colonoscopy performed in siblings within 1 year after diagnosis of the index patient. The intention-to-treat analysis included siblings who refused to participate in the study. Statistical analysis was adjusted for intrafamily correlation. RESULTS: A total of 304 siblings of 125 index patients were included: 160 in the intervention group and 144 in the control group. The colonoscopy acceptance rate among siblings was 56.3% in the intervention group and 35.4% in the control group (P = 0.0027). The respective rates after exclusion of rejections were 69.2% and 37.0% (P < 0.0001). More lesions were detected in the intervention group (1 invasive cancer and 11 advanced adenomas vs. 5 advanced adenomas"";"" P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a personalized nurse-led intervention designed to promote colonoscopy screening acceptance by siblings of patients diagnosed with CRC or CAP before the age of 60 years. Such personalized interventions that also involve clinicians should help reduce CRC-related mortality.",0,0,

Data sources: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, and Ovid Health-STAR from 1991 to February 27, 2015, without language restriction. Study selection: 8 investigators selected articles for single-arm or comparative studies of combined diet and physical activity promotion programs with at least 2 sessions for at least 3 months in participants at increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Data Extraction: 7 investigators extracted data on study design""; descriptions of participants, interventions, and outcomes""; and outcomes and assessed study quality. Data Synthesis: 53 studies (30 diet and physical activity promotion programs versus usual care, 13 more intensive versus less intensive programs, and 13 individual programs) evaluated 66 programs. Compared with usual care, diet and physical activity promotion programs reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes (relative risk [RR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.66]) (16 studies), decreased body weight (net change, -2.2% [CI, -2.9% to -1.4%]) (24 studies), and fasting blood glucose (net change, -0.12 mmol/L [-2.2 mg/dL] [CI, -0.20 to -0.05 mmol/L {-3.6 to -0.9 mg/dL}]) (17 studies), and improved other cardiometabolic risk factors. Evidence of clinical events was limited. The more intensive programs were more effective. Limitations: Wide variation in diet and physical activity promotion programs limited identification of characteristics most relevant to efficacy. Evidence on clinical outcomes and in children was scant. Conclusion: Combined programs to promote diet and physical activity are effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes and improving cardiometabolic risk factors in people at higher risk. More intensive programs are more effective.",0,0,
394,Combining intensive practice nurse advice or brief general practitioner advice with varenicline for smoking cessation in primary care: study protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: The combination of behavioral support and pharmacotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation and is recommended in clinical guidelines. Although general practitioner smoking cessation assistance can be effective, dissemination of clinical practice guidelines and efforts to improve skills have not led to the routine provision of smoking cessation advice among clinicians. generals. Intensive practice nurse counseling could contribute to better smoking cessation rates in primary care. However, the effectiveness of intensive advice from a nurse practitioner versus usual care from a general practitioner in combination with varenicline is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing: (a) intensive individual counseling provided by a nurse practitioner and (b) brief counseling provided by a general practitioner"";"" both groups received open-label varenicline for 12 weeks. A minimum of 272 daily smoking adult participants were recruited and treated in their routine primary care setting. The primary outcome was defined as prolonged abstinence from week 9 to week 26, validated biochemically by exhaled carbon monoxide. Data were analyzed blinded according to the intention-to-treat principle, and participants with missing data on their smoking status at follow-up were counted as smokers. Secondary outcomes included: one-year prolonged abstinence, short-term incremental cost-effectiveness, medication adherence, and baseline predictors of successful smoking cessation. DISCUSSION: This trial is the first to provide scientific evidence on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and potential mechanisms of action of intensive practice nursing advice combined with varenicline under real-life conditions.

395,Comfort First: an evaluation of a procedural pain management program for children with cancer,"BACKGROUND: The Comfort First Program (CFP) provides children and their caregivers with early procedural pain management intervention to reduce procedural pain and distress. This study assessed whether the CFP was meeting its goals and effectively implementing the Royal Australasian College of Physicians pediatric pain management guidelines. METHODS: The study was conducted as a cross-sectional audit of a single site. One hundred thirty-five patients (mean age 7.7 years) receiving treatment at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Children's Cancer Center Day Oncology Unit were observed. Procedural aspects related to the treatment room, caregiver behavior and staff, child distress, and the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were recorded using an audit tool developed for the study. RESULTS: The procedure room was normally quiet and prepared before the child entered. The median duration of the procedure was 8 min. The median waiting time for the procedure was 54 min. Usually at least one caregiver was present during the procedures. Comfort First (CF) physicians were more likely to be present at procedures with a significantly distressed child. CF caregivers, nurses, and physicians generally exhibited behavior that promotes comfort. Topical anesthesia was used regularly. Non-pharmacological supports, particularly distraction, were frequently used. Patients younger than 8 years were significantly more likely to receive non-pharmacological support and to have a caregiver and CF doctor present. Age was a significant predictor of distress, with higher rates of distress in younger children. CONCLUSIONS: The CFP was found to be effectively implementing procedural pain guidelines. A periodic audit is recommended to ensure compliance with pain management standards.",0,0,
396,Coping with challenging behaviour: a cluster randomized controlled trial on the effects of a multidisciplinary program of care for challenging behavior in dementia,"OBJECTIVES: The Grip on Challenging Behavior care program was developed using current guidelines and models on managing challenging behavior in dementia in nursing homes. It was hypothesized that the use of the mindfulness program would lead to a decrease in challenging behavior and prescription of psychoactive drugs without increasing the use of restraints. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted using a stepwise design to implement the care program and assess effects. An assessment of challenging behavior and psychoactive medication was carried out every 4 months in all participating units, followed by the introduction of the care program in a group of 3 to 4 units. A total of 6 time evaluations were carried out during 20 months. SETTING: Seventeen special care dementia units from different nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 659 residents of special care dementia units. All residents with dementia in the unit were included. Units were assigned using random assignment software to 1 of 5 groups with different starting points for implementation of the care program. INTERVENTION: A care program consisting of various procedures and evaluation tools, which ensure a multidisciplinary approach and structure the process of managing challenging behavior in dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Challenging behavior was measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Research assistants (blinded to unit intervention status) interviewed unit nurses about challenging behaviour. Data on psychoactive drugs and restraints were retrieved from residents' medical records. RESULTS: A total of 2,292 assessments involving 659 residents (1,126 control measures, 1,166 intervention measures) were performed. The group of residents who remained in the intervention condition compared to the group in the control condition differed significantly in CMAI change scores between successive assessments [-2.4 CMAI points, 95% confidence interval (CI) : -4.3 to -0.6]. No significant effect was found for the control-to-intervention group compared with the group that remained in the control group (0.0 point CMAI, 95% CI -2.3 to 2.4). Significant effects were found in 5 of the 12 items of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and in the use of antipsychotics (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.80) and antidepressants (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0 .44-0.94). No effect on the use of restraints was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Grip on Challenging behavior program was able to decrease some forms of challenging behavior and the use of psychoactive drugs.",0,0,

398,"Communication Style and Exercise Compliance in Physiotherapy (CONNECT): A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial to Test a Theory-Based Intervention for Increasing Chronic Low Back Pain Patients' Adherence to Physiotherapists' Recommendations: Study Rationale, Design, and methods","BACKGROUND: Physical activity and physiotherapy are among the accepted clinical rehabilitation guidelines and are recommended self-management strategies for chronic low back pain. However, many people with back pain do not follow the recommendations of their physical therapist. Poor patient adherence can decrease the effectiveness of home rehabilitation advice and exercises. According to self-determination theory, support from health professionals can promote patients' autonomous motivation and greater long-term behavioral persistence (eg, adherence to physical therapists' recommendations). The aim of this trial is to assess the effect of an intervention designed to increase physiotherapists' autonomy supportive communication on low back pain patients' adherence to physical activity and exercise therapy recommendations. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be a single-blind cluster randomized controlled trial. Outpatient physical therapy centers (N = 12) in Dublin, Ireland (population = 1.25 million) will be randomly assigned by a computer-generated algorithm to the experimental or control arm. Physiotherapists from the experimental arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will attend eight hours of communication skills training. The training will include handouts, workbooks, video examples, role plays and discussions designed to teach physical therapists how to communicate in a way that promotes patient self-motivation. Physiotherapists in the control arm of the waiting list (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will not receive this training. Participants (N = 292) with chronic low back pain will complete assessments at baseline, as well as 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after their first physical therapy appointment. Primary outcomes will include adherence to physical therapy recommendations, as well as low back pain, function, and well-being. Participants will be blinded to treatment assignment as they will not be told whether their physiotherapist has received training in communication skills. Outcome assessors will also be blinded. We will use linear mixed models to test for differences between arms in both mean levels and rates of change of outcome variables. We will use structural equation modeling to examine the process of change, including hypothetical mediating effects. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first to test the effect of a self-determination theory-based communication skills training program for physical therapists on compliance with rehabilitation recommendations for their low back pain patients.",0,0,

This project arose when the Health System Strategy Division of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care subsequently requested the secretariat to provide an evidence platform for the Ministry's recently published Diabetes Strategy. After an initial review of the strategy and consultation with experts, the secretariat identified five key areas where evidence was needed. Evidence-based analyzes have been prepared for each of these five areas: insulin pumps, behavioral interventions, bariatric surgery, home telemonitoring, and community care. For each area, an economic analysis was completed where appropriate and is described in a separate report.

CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Diabetes (ie, diabetes mellitus) is a highly prevalent chronic metabolic disorder that interferes with the body's ability to produce or effectively use insulin. The majority (90%) of patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. (1) According to the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), intensive control of blood glucose and blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of complications microvascular and macrovascular disorders in type 2 diabetics. Although many studies have documented that patients often do not meet glycemic control goals specified by national and international guidelines, factors associated with glycemic control are less well studied, one of the Who is the care provider? Multidisciplinary approaches to care may be particularly important for diabetes management. According to the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guidelines, the diabetes health care team should be multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Currently in Ontario, the core diabetes health care team consists of at least one family doctor and/or diabetes specialist, and diabetes educators (registered nurse and registered dietitian). Increasing the role of allied health professionals in diabetes care and their collaboration with physicians may represent a more cost-effective option for diabetes management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined multidisciplinary care programs, but these have been limited to a specific component of multidisciplinary care (eg, intensified education programs) or performed as part of a disease management program broader, not all of which were multidisciplinary in nature. Most reviews also do not clearly define the intervention(s) of interest, making the evaluation of such multidisciplinary community programs difficult.

Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer, and for those studies that met the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then with a panel of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of the evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to the GRADE methodology. Given the high clinical heterogeneity of the articles that met the inclusion criteria, specific models of specialized multidisciplinary community care based on models of care currently supported in Ontario, models of care that were commonly reported in the literature, as well as suggestions from an Expert Advisory Panel meeting held on January 21, 2009. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The initial search returned 2116 unique citations, of which 22 RCTs and 9 published systematic reviews were identified that met the eligibility criteria. . Of these, five studies focused on care provided by at least one nurse, dietitian and physician (primary care and/or specialist) care model (Model 1; see Table ES 1), while three studies focused on care delivered by at least one pharmacist and one primary care physician (Model 2; ""see Table ES 2). Based on moderate-quality evidence, Model 2 specialized multidisciplinary community care has shown a statistically and clinically significant reduction in HbA1c of 1.0 % compared to usual care The effects of this model on SBP, however, are uncertain compared to usual care, based on very low-quality evidence Model 2 specialized multidisciplinary community care has shown a reduction statistically and clinically significant in both HbA1c of 1.05% (based on high-quality evidence) and SBP of 7.13 mm Hg (based on moderate-quality evidence) da) compared to usual care For both models, the evidence does not suggest a preferred setting of care delivery (ie, primary care versus outpatient hospital care). clinical t vs. community clinic).

402,Community-based knowledge transfer and sharing: helping community-based organizations link research with action,"Background Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important stakeholders in health systems and are increasingly being asked to use research evidence to inform their advocacy efforts, program planning, and service delivery. CBOs are increasingly turning to community-based research (CBR) given its participatory approach and emphasis on linking research with action. To further facilitate the use of research evidence by CBOs, we have developed a strategy for community-based knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) that helps CBOs more effectively link research evidence action research. We developed the strategy by: outlining the main characteristics of CBOs and why they are important stakeholders in health systems; describe the concepts and methods for CBR and KTE; compare CBR's efforts to link research evidence to action with those discussed in the KTE literature and use the comparison to develop a community-based framework for KTE that builds on both the strengths of CBR and the existing frameworks. Existing KTEs Discussion We found that CBR is particularly effective in fostering a climate for using research evidence and producing research evidence to community organizations through community engagement. However, community organizations are not always as involved in activities to link research evidence to action on a larger scale or to evaluate these efforts. Therefore, our community-based strategy for KTE focuses on: an expanded 'link and exchange' model (ie, research producers and users engaging in a process of asking and answering questions together); a greater emphasis on producing and disseminating systematic reviews that address topics of interest to community organizations; develop a large-scale evidence service consisting of both “push” and “pull” efforts that highlight actionable messages from community-relevant systematic reviews in a user-friendly manner” and rigorous evaluations of the efforts to link research evidence to action Summary Through this type of strategy, the use of research evidence for CBO advocacy efforts, program planning, and service delivery can be better facilitated and refined continuously through ongoing evaluations of its impact.",0,0,
403,Community primary care: improvement and evaluation of diabetes control,"The morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes make it a prime target for quality improvement research. Quality gaps and racial/gender disparities persist in this patient population requiring sustainable improvement in clinical diabetes management. The authors of this study sought to (1) provide a population perspective on diabetes management and (2) reinforce evidence-based clinical guidelines through a web-based educational module. The project also aimed to obtain information about remote work with a community. of rural doctors. This longitudinal pre-post intervention study involved 18 internal medicine physicians and included 3 points of data extraction from medical records over 24 months. A web-based educational module was introduced after baseline data extraction. This module contained chapters on clinical education, practical tools, and self-assessment. Results showed sustained improvement in most clinical outcomes and demonstrated the effectiveness of using web-based media to reinforce clinical guidelines and change physician behavior.",0,0,
404,Community Implemented Trauma Therapy for Former Child Soldiers in Northern Uganda,"Context The psychological rehabilitation of former child soldiers and their successful reintegration into post-conflict society presents challenges. Despite high rates of deterioration, there have been no randomized controlled trials examining the feasibility and efficacy of mental health interventions for former child soldiers. Objective To assess the efficacy of a community-based intervention targeting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in formerly abducted persons. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized controlled trial recruiting 85 former child soldiers with PTSD from a population-based survey of 1,113 Northern Ugandans aged 12 to 25 years, conducted between November 2007 and October 2009 in IDP camps. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: narrative exposure therapy (n = 29), an academic refresher program with supportive counseling elements (n = 28), or a waiting list (n = 28). PTSD symptoms and trauma-related guilt feelings were measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The respective sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to assess depression and suicide risk, and a locally adapted scale was used to measure perceived stigma. PTSD symptoms, depression, and related impairment were assessed before treatment and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-intervention. Intervention treatments were carried out in 8 sessions by trained local lay therapists, directly in the communities. Main outcome measures Change in PTSD severity, assessed over a 1-year period after treatment. Secondary outcome measures were symptoms of depression, severity of suicidal ideation, feelings of guilt, and perceived stigma. Results PTSD symptom severity (range, 0-148) improved significantly more in the narrative exposure therapy group than in the academic recovery group (mean change difference, ?14.06 [95% confidence interval , ?27.19 to ?0.92]) and expect -list (mean change difference, ?13.04 [95% confidence interval, ?26.79 to 0.72]) groups. Time-treatment interaction contrast analyzes of the mixed-effects model on PTSD symptom change over time revealed a superiority of narrative exposure therapy compared to academic recovery (F1,234.1 = 5.21, P = .02) and wait. striped (F1,228.3 = 5.28, P = .02). Narrative exposure therapy produced a larger within-treatment effect size (Cohen d = 1.80) than academic remediation (d = 0.83) and waiting list (d = 0.81). Conclusion Among former child soldiers in Uganda, short-term trauma-focused treatment compared with an academic remedial program including supportive counseling or with the waiting list resulted in a greater reduction in PTSD symptoms.",0,0,
405,"Community cardiovascular disease prevention programs and health outcomes in a rural county, 1970-2010","Importance Few comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction programs, particularly those in low-income rural communities, have sustained community-wide interventions for more than 10 years and have demonstrated the effect of improvements in risk factors on morbidity reduction and mortality. Objective To document the health outcomes associated with a comprehensive, integrated cardiovascular risk reduction program in Franklin County, Maine, a low-income, rural community. Design, Setting, and Participants Forty-year observational study involving residents of Franklin County, Maine, a low-income rural population of 22,444 in 1970, using the previous decade as a reference, and comparing Franklin County to other counties of Maine and state averages. Interventions Community-wide programs that focus on high blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking, as well as diet and physical activity, sponsored by multiple community organizations, including the local hospital and physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures ""Resident engagement""; detection, treatment, and control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia; smoking cessation rates; hospitalization rates from 1994 to 2006, adjusted for median family income; and mortality rates since 1970. through 2010, adjusted for family income and age.ResultsMore than 150,000 individual contacts of county residents occurred over 40 years.Over time, as cardiovascular risk factor programs were added, relevant health indicators improved. Hypertension control had an absolute increase of 24.7% (95% CI, 21.6%-27.7%) from 18.3% to 43.0% from 1975 to 1978, then control of elevated cholesterol had an absolute increase of 28.5% (95% CI, 25.3%-31.6%) from 0.4% to 28.9%, from 1986 to 2010. Smoking cessation rates improved from 48.5% to 69.5%, better than state averages (Observed?-?Expected [O?-?E], 11.3%; 95% CI , 5.5%-17.7%; P?<?.001), 1996-2000; these differences then disappeared when Maine's overall dropout rate increased. Franklin County hospitalizations per capita were lower than expected for the period measured, 1994-2006 (O?-?E, -17 discharges/1000 population; 95% CI -20.1 to -13.9; P ?<?.001). Franklin was the only county in Maine with adjusted mortality consistently lower than predicted during the 1970-1989 and 1990-2010 periods (O?-?E, -60.4 deaths/100,000; 95% CI, -97.9 to -22.8 ; P?<?.001 and -41.6/100?000; 95% CI, -77.3 to -5.8;"" P?=?.005, respectively).

406,Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder.,"Background: Second-generation antidepressants dominate the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of these agents is conflicting. Purpose: To compare the benefits and harms of second generation antidepressants for treating MDD in adults. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts English studies from 1980 to August 2011 and reference lists of relevant review articles and gray literature. Study Selection: Two independent reviewers identified randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration to assess efficacy and observational studies with at least 1000 participants to assess harm. Data Extraction: Reviewers abstracted data on study design and conduct, participants, interventions, and outcomes, and rated study quality. Extracted data and quality ratings were checked and confirmed by a lead reviewer. Data Synthesis: Meta-analyses and mixed treatment comparisons of treatment response and weighted mean differences on specific scales for rating depression were performed. Based on 234 studies, no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or effectiveness were detected for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of MDD. No differences in efficacy were observed in patients with accompanying symptoms or in subgroups based on age, gender, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life. Limitations: Most trials were conducted in highly selected populations. Publication bias could affect the estimates for some comparisons. Mixed treatment comparisons cannot conclusively exclude differences in efficacy. Evidence within subgroups was limited. Conclusion: The current evidence does not justify the recommendation of a particular second-generation antidepressant on the basis of differences in efficacy. Differences in onset of action and adverse events can be considered when choosing a drug.",0,0,
407,Comparative Benefits and Harms of Second-Generation Antidepressants: Background Paper for the American College of Physicians,"Background: Second-generation antidepressants dominate the treatment of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and subsyndromic depression. Evidence on comparative benefits and harms is still accumulating. Purpose: To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine) for the treatment of depressive disorders in adults. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007, limited to articles in English. Reference lists of relevant review articles were handsearched and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research database searched for unpublished research. We included six previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses of good or fair quality, as well as 155 direct, placebo-controlled, or double-blind randomized controlled trials of good or fair quality of at least 6 weeks' duration. duration. We also included 35 observational studies with at least 100 participants and a follow-up of at least 12 weeks for damage. and the results. Data Synthesis: If data were sufficient, meta-analyses of head-to-head trials were performed to determine the relative benefit of treatment response and weighted mean differences on specific depression rating scales. If insufficient evidence was available, adjusted indirect comparisons were made using meta-regressions and network meta-analyses. Second-generation antidepressants did not differ substantially in efficacy or effectiveness for the treatment of major depressive disorder based on 203 studies"";"" however, the incidence of specific adverse events and the onset of action differed. Evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the comparative efficacy, effectiveness, or harms of these agents for the treatment of dysthymia and subsyndromic depression. Limitation: Adjusted indirect comparisons have methodological limitations and cannot conclusively rule out differences in efficacy. Conclusion: the current evidence does not guarantee the choice of one second-generation antidepressant over another based on the differences in efficacy and effectiveness. Other differences regarding onset of action and adverse events may be relevant to the choice of a drug.",0,0,
408,Comparative effectiveness of audit feedback versus additional physician communication training in improving cancer detection in patients with limited health literacy,"BACKGROUND: We designed a continuing medical education (CME) program to teach primary care physicians (PCPs) how to engage in cancer risk communication and shared decision making with patients who have limited health literacy (HL). OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether training PCPs, in addition to audit feedback, improves their communication behaviors and increases cancer detection among patients with limited HL to a greater extent than just providing feedback on clinical performance. DESIGN: Four-year cluster randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen primary care physicians and 168 patients with limited HL who were overdue for colorectal/breast/cervical cancer screening. INTERVENTIONS: Communication intervention PCPs received skills training that included standardized patient feedback (SP) on counseling behaviors. All PCPs underwent semi-annual patient screening status file audits for up to 24 months and received two annual performance feedback reports. MAIN MEASURES: PCPs experienced three unannounced SP encounters during which SPs rated the PCP's communication behaviors. We examined between-group differences in changes in SP scores and patient knowledge of cancer screening guidelines over 12 months""; and changes in patients' cancer screening rates over 24 months. KEY RESULTS: There were no differences between groups in SP ratings of communication with the doctor at baseline At follow-up, communication intervention PCPs scored higher on overall communication about cancer risks and shared decision making related to colorectal cancer screening compared to PCPs who only received performance feedback. Screening rates were increased among PCP patients in both groups;"" however, there were no differences between groups in detection rates except for mammography. The communication intervention did not improve patients' knowledge of cancer detection. CONCLUSION: Compared with audit and feedback alone, the inclusion of PCP communication training increases PCP patient-centered counseling behaviors but not cancer detection among patients with limited HL. Larger studies need to be done to determine whether the lack of change in cancer detection was due to clinic/patient sample size versus the ineffectiveness of communication training in changing outcomes.",0,1,

410,Comparative efficacy of interventions to promote hand hygiene in the hospital: systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the relative effectiveness of the World Health Organization's 2005 campaign (WHO-5) and other interventions to promote hand hygiene among healthcare workers in hospital settings and to summarize associated information on resource use. DESIGN Systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, NHS Center for Reviews and Dissemination, Cochrane Library, and the EPOC registry (December 2009 to February 2014)""; studies selected by the same search terms in previous systematic reviews (1980- METHODS OF REVIEW) Included studies were randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time series studies that implemented an intervention to improve hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers in hospital settings and measured adherence or appropriate surrogate indicators that met predefined quality inclusion criteria When studies had not used appropriate analytic methods, primary data were re-analysed Random-effects and network meta-analyses were performed in studies reporting adherence directly observed with hand hygiene when considered sufficiently homogeneous with respect to interventions and participants Information on resources required for interventions was extracted and classified into three levels. RESULTS Of the 3639 retrieved studies, 41 met the inclusion criteria (six randomized controlled trials, 32 interrupted time series, one nonrandomized trial, and two controlled before-and-after studies). Meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials showed that the addition of goal setting to WHO-5 was associated with better compliance (pooled odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.76; I( 2)=81%). Of 22 pairwise interrupted time series comparisons, 18 showed step increases in hand hygiene compliance, and all but four showed a trend of increasing compliance after the intervention. The network meta-analysis indicated considerable uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of the interventions, but nonetheless provided evidence that WHO-5 is effective and that compliance can be further improved by adding interventions that include goal setting, incentives for reward and accountability. Nineteen studies reported clinical outcomes; data from these were consistent with clinically important reductions in infection rates resulting from improved hand hygiene for some but not all important hospital-acquired pathogens. Reported costs of interventions ranged from $225 to $4669 (£146-£3035;"" Ã¢â€šÂ¬204-Ã¢â€šÂ¬4229) per 1000 bed days. CONCLUSION Hand hygiene promotion with WHO -5 is effective in increasing health worker compliance The addition of goal setting, reward incentives and accountability strategies may lead to further improvements Reporting of resources needed for such interventions remains inadequate .",0,1,
411,Comparison of the cost effects of two quality strategies to improve test ordering in primary care: a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the costs and cost reductions of an innovative strategy aimed at improving primary care physicians' test ordering routines, compared to a traditional strategy. DESIGN: Multicentre randomized controlled trial with randomization at local primary care physician group level. SETTING: Primary care: local groups of primary care physicians in five regions of the Netherlands with diagnostic centers. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven existing local primary care physician groups, including 194 primary care physicians. INTERVENTION: The test ordering strategy was developed systematically and combined feedback, guideline education, and small group quality improvement sessions. In regular quality meetings in local groups, primary care physicians discussed each other's test requesting behavior, related it to guidelines, and made individual and/or group plans for change. Thirteen groups participated in the full strategy (full intervention arm), while 14 groups received only feedback (feedback arm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Operating costs, development costs, and research costs were calculated for the intervention period per primary care physician per 6 months. The mean costs of the tests requested by the primary care physician every 6 months were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS: It was found that the new strategy cost 702.00, while the feedback strategy cost 58.00. Including running costs alone, the intervention was found to cost €554.70, compared to €17.10 per primary care physician per 6 months in the feedback arm. Excluding opportunity costs for time spent by clinicians, the intervention was found to cost 92.70 per physician per 6 months in the full intervention arm. The average cost reduction physicians in that arm achieved by reducing unnecessary testing was 144 times greater per physician per 6 months than physicians in the feedback arm (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, including expected non-monetary benefits, we recommend further long-term effects and cost-effect studies on quality strategy implementation.",0,1,
412,Comparison of the efficacy of staff instruction versus home staff in an intervention to improve the management of hypertension,"PURPOSE: To determine whether a resident physician can be as effective as a faculty opinion leader in changing physician compliance with a hypertension practice guideline. METHOD: At a general internal medicine clinic associated with an internal medicine residency program, sequential charts were reviewed for patients with uncontrolled or new-onset hypertension who were seen routinely over a 2-week period. Subsequently, 23 providers were randomly assigned to an academic intervention to implement a hypertension practice guideline led by a single second-year resident instructor (RI), and 21 providers were assigned to the same intervention led by a single staff internist ( SI) with an interest in hypertension. The intervention involved academic details, audit charts with feedback, and behavioral reinforcement. Six weeks later, the chart audit was repeated to assess change in practice patterns between providers taught by RI compared to those taught by SI. RESULTS: Overall, guideline-consistent management improved from 32% (51/157) to 45% (56/123) (p < 0.01) post-intervention. This change was due to improvement in care provided by SI-led intervention providers: 28% (17/60) to 57% (26/46) (p < 0.003). IR-led intervention providers showed no improvement: 35% (34/97) to 39% (30/77) (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was effective in improving providers' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline, but only when led by a faculty opinion leader. A resident instructor using the same format was unable to change the providers' behavior.",1,1,
413,Comparison of strategies to reduce rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in surgical patients: a multicenter controlled intervention trial.,"Objective To compare the effect of two strategies (improved hand hygiene versus detection and decolonization of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) alone and in combination on MRSA rates in operating rooms. Design Prospective, controlled, interventional cohort study, with 6-month baseline phases, 12-month intervention, and 6-month washout phases. Assembly of 33 surgical pavilions of 10 hospitals in nine countries in Europe and Israel. Participants All patients admitted to the registered wards for more than 24 h. Interventions The two strategies compared were (1) enhanced hand hygiene promotion and (2) universal screening for MRSA with contact precautions and decolonization (mupirocin and chlorhexidine intranasal baths) of MRSA carriers. Four hospitals were assigned to each intervention and two hospitals combined both strategies, using MRSA screening. Outcome measures Monthly rates of MRSA clinical cultures per 100 susceptible patients (primary outcome) and MRSA infections per 100 admissions (secondary outcome). A planned subgroup analysis was performed for clean operating rooms. Results After adjusting for clustering and potential confounders, neither strategy, when used alone, was associated with significant changes in MRSA rates. The combination of both strategies was associated with a reduction in the rate of clinical MRSA cultures of 12% per month (adjusted incidence rate (aIRR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98). In clean operating rooms, Strategy 2 (MRSA screening, contact precautions, and decolonization) was associated with decreased rates of clinical MRSA cultures (15% monthly decrease, aIRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0, 74 to 0.97) and MRSA infections (17% monthly decrease, aIRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). Conclusions In operating rooms with relatively low MRSA prevalence, a combination of improved standard and MRSA-specific infection control approaches was required to reduce MRSA rates. Implementation of single interventions was not effective except in clean operating rooms where MRSA screening in conjunction with contact precautions and decolonization was associated with significant reductions in MRSA clinical culture and infection rates.",0,1,
414,Comparison of the Educational Efficacy of Internet-Based CME with Live Interactive CME Workshops: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that a variety of continuing medical education (CME) techniques can encourage behavior change in physicians, no randomized trials comparing performance outcomes of physicians have been conducted. physicians participating in Internet-based CME with physicians participating in a live CME intervention using documented approaches to be effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Internet-based CME can produce changes comparable to those produced through live, small-group, interactive CME in physicians' knowledge and behaviors that impact patient care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial conducted between August 2001 and July 2002. Participants were 97 primary care physicians selected from 21 practice sites in Houston, Texas, including 7 community health centers and 14 private group practices. . A control group of 18 physicians from these same sites received no intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomly assigned to either an Internet-based CME intervention that could be completed in multiple sessions over 2 weeks, or to a single, live, interactive CME workshop in small groups. Both incorporated similar multifaceted instructional approaches that have proven effective in real-world settings. Content was based on the National Institutes of Health National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge was assessed immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 12 weeks later. The percentage of high-risk patients who underwent adequate lipid profile examination and pharmacotherapeutic treatment according to guidelines was documented with record audits performed during a 5-month period before the intervention and a 5-month period after. of the intervention. RESULTS: Both interventions produced similar and significant immediate and 12-week gains in knowledge, representing large increases in the percentage of items correct (pretest to posttest: 31.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 27.0%-35.0%]""; 12-week pretest: 36.4% [95% CI, 32.2%-40.6%]; P = 93%) with no significant change post-test However, the Internet-based intervention was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of high-risk patients treated with guideline pharmacotherapeutics (preintervention, 85.3%; postintervention, 90.3%;"" p = 0 .04). CONCLUSIONS: Properly designed, evidence-based online CME can produce objectively measured changes in behavior and sustained gains in knowledge that are comparable or superior to those obtained from effective in vivo activities.",1,1,

Several studies have evaluated the effect of mailing reminders, but few have compared alternative ways of reminding patients to receive the vaccine. In a randomized trial of 939 patients aged 65 years or older in four family practices conducted between October 23 and December 31, 1984, we compared three ways of reminding elderly patients to receive the vaccine: personal reminder by part of the doctor, telephone reminder by the nurse and reminder by letter. The vaccination rates for the three groups were 22.9%, 37%, and 35.1%, respectively. No reminder was sent to a control group and the rate was 9.8%.

418,Complementary therapy in allergic rhinitis,"The term complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) refers to those therapeutic and diagnostic approaches that are different from conventional allopathic medicine. CAM can encompass homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, antioxidant therapy, and numerous holistic or behavioral techniques. Allergists and physicians from all disciplines are faced with patients using CAM treatments, so it is imperative that they become familiar with the scientific literature that surrounds them. Given the high prevalence of allergic diseases and the associated costs of CAM treatments, testing of CAM therapies is needed to establish appropriate guidelines for their use. The efficacy of CAM modalities needs to be established with randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that include control for adverse effects. Of all the CAM therapies examined for treating allergic rhinitis, some herbal and antioxidant therapies demonstrate a trend toward some clinical efficacy. Researchers have yet to determine how to integrate these CAM modalities into the overall treatment paradigm for allergic rhinitis.",0,0,

This article describes the pharmaceutical care process tailored to individual patient problems in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial and defines the care package. METHODS: After a preliminary selection of patients with the help of the IPMP algorithmic computer tool, trained Dutch community pharmacists conducted structured consultations with patients (aged 13 to 70 years) in the intervention arm to identify behavior and problems. specific to your medication. Based on this identification process, a personalized intervention was constructed that could comprise one or more of the six pharmaceutical care modules. The modules were grouped into sets that described the complete program of care provided to a patient. If necessary, the pharmacists consulted with the patients' physicians to improve the prescribed therapy. After the interventions, medication changes were discussed with the patients. Prescribed medication and refill rate were monitored on the pharmacy computer for 1 year. All activities and results were extensively monitored and documented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Process description, ie number of pharmaceutical care modules provided and medication changes. Pharmacist satisfaction. RESULTS: Personalized interventions were provided to 199 patients at risk of suboptimal drug therapy. In total, 813 pharmaceutical care modules were carried out and documented, and they were grouped into four different programs. In addition to education and motivation to comply with the prescribed medication for the 199 patients, a medication change was suggested in 124 cases. Patients and doctors agreed to a change in 94 cases. Device change was agreed in 58 of 64 cases, often simultaneously with medication change. Pharmacists consulted doctors on 100 patients. Pharmacists reported satisfaction with the pharmaceutical care approach. CONCLUSION: Due to the extensive documentation, the interventions could be fully described. Pharmacists noted better medication use after educating patients or resolving their medication-related problems. In collaboration with doctors, pharmacological treatment could be improved.",0,0,420.0

421,Complexities of fall prevention in clinical settings: a comment,"Falls and associated injuries and mortality are a growing concern among aging Americans. The effective management of fall risk is a complicated process that requires the participation of both health professionals and older adults in three related actions: (a) early detection to detect risk factors"", (b) prescription of interventions personalized, and (c) implementation of, adherence to, and adherence to the intervention by the older adult. Early detection of fall risk can prevent future falls;"" however, adoption of evidence-based screening and evaluation protocols in the clinical setting has been limited. A variety of practice guidelines and financial incentives are available to healthcare professionals to facilitate adoption. However, a gap remains between recommended practices and current clinical activities. This commentary addresses the complexities of falls prevention practices and offers solutions that may facilitate adoption by clinical practices. To this end, this commentary will present two models (ie, a clinical approach and a financial incentive approach) to summarize current clinical recommendations and practice guidelines for fall risk management in clinical settings. The various drivers to encourage the adoption of evidence-based fall risk management strategies will be described. In this context, we will discuss how understanding different system-wide practice improvement initiatives and the factors that drive action across physician groups can facilitate the adoption and implementation of fall risk management behaviors by clinicians. of the doctors. Additional efforts are needed to explore and evaluate similar initiatives to adopt and implement fall risk management practices at different points of entry into the system (eg, community settings, patients, caregivers).",0,0,
422,Compliance with biopsy recommendations from a prostate cancer risk calculator,"UNLABELED: Type of study - Diagnosis (cohort) Evidence level 2b What is known about the topic? And what does the study add? Until now, few publications have shown that a prediction model influences the behavior of both doctors and patients. To our knowledge, it was unknown whether urologists and patients adhered to the recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator and their reasons for noncompliance. In most patients, the recommendations of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (ERSPC RC) on the need for a prostate biopsy were followed. In most of the cases of non-compliance with the 'no biopsy' recommendations, a PSA level >/= 3 ng/mL was decisive for opting for biopsy. Prior to the implementation of the ERSPC RC in large-scale urological practices, it is important to obtain information on the use of guidelines that may counter the adoption of the use of the RC as a result of contrary recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To assess both urologist and patient compliance with a ""no biopsy"" or ""biopsy"" recommendation from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC), as well as their reasons for noncompliance. Evaluate the determinants of patient compliance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ERSPC RC calculates the probability of a sextant-positive prostate biopsy (P(posb) ) using the serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the results of digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, and the volume prostate evaluated ultrasonographically. A biopsy was recommended if P(posb) >/=20%. Between 2008 and 2011, eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals included 443 patients (aged 55 to 75 years) after a PSA test without prior biopsy. Urologists calculated P(posb) using CR in the presence of patients and completed a compliance questionnaire. Patients completed a questionnaire on prostate cancer knowledge, attitude toward prostate biopsy, self-rated health (12-item short-form Health Survey), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, memorial anxiety for prostate cancer) and decision-making measures (Decisional Conflict Scale). RESULTS: Both urologists and patients complied with the CR recommendation in 368 of 443 (83%) cases. If a biopsy was recommended, almost all patients (96%""; 257/269) complied, although 63 of the 174 (36%) patients were biopsied against the CR recommendation. Those who complied with the 'do not biopsy' had a lower mean P(posb) than non-compliers (9% vs 14%; P /= 3 ng/mL) (78%; 49/63) and patients because they wanted certainty (60%;"" 38/63 ). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients followed the ERSPC RC recommendations on prostate biopsy. Therefore, CR may be a promising tool to support clinical decision making.",0,0,
423,Compliance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for hyperlipidemia in a resident-managed outpatient clinic: a retrospective data analysis.,"BACKGROUND: One in six adults (16.3% of the US adult population) have high total cholesterol levels and have twice the risk of heart disease compared to people with optimal levels. OBJECTIVE: To assess internal medicine residents' compliance with the latest National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines in the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Outpatient Clinic, Saint Vincent Hospital, Worcester, Massachusetts. PATIENTS: Patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia who attended the clinic over a 1-year period, from December 2009 to November 2010. MEASUREMENTS: A chart review was performed to assess residents' compliance with LDL cholesterol guidelines. of the NCEP-ATP III. and management of non-HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: 770 records were reviewed. Only 212 (27.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Data analysis revealed better adherence to pharmacological treatment (44%-77%) and therapeutic lifestyle changes (44%-83%) compared to follow-up recommendations (22%-31%). An increase in compliance was also seen in all intervention areas when patients had an abnormal lipid profile. LIMITATIONS: Compliance was assessed solely on the basis of electronic medical record documentation, and therefore we may be underestimating compliance with therapeutic lifestyle changes and follow-up recommendations. CONCLUSION: Compliance of internal medicine residents in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with hyperlipidemia according to the NCEP-ATP III guidelines was suboptimal and needs improvement.",0,0,

425,Computerized Criticism Embedded in Daily Clinical Practice Affects Physicians' Behavior: A Randomized Clinical Trial with AsthmaCritic,"OBJECTIVE: We developed AsthmaCritic, a non-inquisitive criticism system integrated with the electronic medical record of general practitioners. The system is based on the guidelines for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. This article evaluates the effect of AsthmaCritic in the monitoring and treatment of asthma and COPD by Dutch general practitioners in daily practice. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial in 32 practices (40 Dutch general practitioners) using electronic patient records. An intervention group was given the use of AsthmaCritic, a control group continued to work as usual. Both groups had the asthma and COPD guidelines commonly distributed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. We measured the average number of contacts, FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume), and peak flow measurements per asthma/COPD patient per practice"";"" and, the average number of prescriptions for antihistamines, cromoglycate, deptropin, and oral bronchodilators per asthma/COPD patient per practice. RESULTS: The number of contacts increased in the age group from 12 to 39 years. The number of FEV1, peak flow, and proportion of coded measurements increased, while the number of cromolyn prescriptions decreased in the 12-39 age group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the AsthmaCritic guideline-based review system changed the way clinicians monitored their patients and, to a lesser extent, their treatment behavior. In addition, the doctors changed their data recording habits.",0,1,

427,Computer reminders for chlamydia screening in general practice: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background: Chlamydia notifications are increasing in Australia, and the use of a computer alert that prompts general practitioners to screen young women is a potential way to increase opportunistic testing for chlamydia. The aim of this trial was to determine the efficacy of a general practice computer alert on chlamydia screening in young women. Methods: In 2006, clinics (n = 68) in Melbourne, Australia, were cluster randomized into 2 groups: the intervention group received a computerized alert advising the general practitioner to discuss chlamydia testing with his patient, who appeared when the medical history of a 16-year-old patient was completed. - a 24-year-old woman""; the control group received no alert. The outcome was whether or not that patient received a chlamydia test at the level of a single visit with an eligible patient. A mixed-effects logistic regression model adjusting for pooling was used to assess the impact of the alert on the proportion of women tested for chlamydia during the trial period. Results: Testing increased from 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.8, 9 .8) to 12.2% (95% CI: 9.1, 15.3) (P < 0.01) in the intervention group, and 8.8% (95% CI: 6.8, 10 .7) to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.5, 12.7) (P < 0.01) in the control group Overall, the intervention group had 27% (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) greater increase in testing Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that alerts alone may not be sufficient to increase chlamydia test levels high enough to have a impact on the burden of chlamydia in the population n, but could be included as part of a more complex intervention.",0,1,
428,Computerized reminders to implement preventive care guidelines for hospitalized patients.,"Background: Hospitalizations are an opportunity to provide preventive care. Objective: To determine if computerized reminders, which we have shown to be effective in our outpatient setting, increase the provision of preventive care for hospitalized patients. Methods: Randomized controlled trial in the general medicine inpatient service of an urban public hospital affiliated with a university. The study subjects were 78 house employees rotating in the 6 general medicine services. The intervention consisted of reminders to physicians printed on daily round reports about preventive care for which their patients were eligible and suggested orders for preventive care delivered through physician workstations. Preventive care guidelines were derived from the recommendations of the US Preventive Care Task Force. Compliance with preventive care guidelines and house staff attitudes toward providing preventive care to hospitalized patients were the main outcome measures. Results: No significant differences were observed between intervention and control physicians in adherence to preventive care guidelines in the aggregate or when individual preventive care actions were analyzed. This was true despite the fact that most doctors supported the provision of most types of inpatient preventive care. Conclusions: Despite previous success in increasing preventive care in the outpatient setting, we were unable, using a moderately intensive intervention, to increase the provision of preventive care during hospitalizations. The attending physicians during hospitalization were not the patients' primary care physicians, which proved to be a significant barrier. More intensive interventions or more direct links between inpatient and outpatient providers may be required to overcome this resistance. Arch Intern Med. 1996"";""156:1551-1556",0,1,
429,Computer screensaver hand hygiene information curbs a negative trend in hand hygiene behavior.,"Background Proper hand hygiene among healthcare workers is the most important infection prevention measure"";"" however, compliance is generally low. Profit-framed messages (ie, messages that emphasize the benefits of hand hygiene rather than the risks of non-compliance) may be more effective, but have not been tested. Methods The study was conducted in a 27-bed neonatal intensive care unit. We performed an interrupted time series analysis of objectively measured hand sanitizing events. We used electronic devices in hand sanitizer dispensers, which continuously documented the frequency of hand sanitizing events. In addition, hand hygiene compliance was directly observed before and after the intervention period. Results The negative trend in hand hygiene events per patient-day before the intervention (decrease of 2.3 [standard error, 0.5] per week) changed to a significant positive trend (increase of 1.5 [0 .5] per week) after the intervention (P < .001). Direct observations confirmed these results, showing a significant improvement in hand hygiene compliance from 193 of 303 (63.6%) hand hygiene events observed at pretest to 201 of 281 (71.5%) in the post test. Conclusions We conclude that profit-framed hand hygiene messages presented on screen savers can improve hand hygiene compliance.",1,1,
430,Computer Administered Clinical Rating Scales. A review,"Although clinician-administered symptom rating scales are the most widely used outcome measures in pharmaceutical research, error variance due to poor interrater reliability increases the risk of type II errors in multicenter clinical trials. Such error variation could obscure the true differences between active drug and placebo, or between two comparator compounds. Computer-administered versions of symptom rating scales originally designed to be administered by trained clinicians offer a solution to this problem. This article reviews the empirical data on the reliability, validity, and equivalence of computer-administered rating scales. Computer-administered versions of clinician-administered scales are now available for the assessment of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. Validation studies support the reliability, validity and equivalence of these scales. Patient feedback has been positive, with patients generally more honest and often preferring the computer to assess sensitive areas such as suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, sexual behavior or HIV-related symptoms. Applications that use interactive voice response (IVR) technology facilitate the longitudinal follow-up of patients without the need for office visits to collect data, increase the accessibility of information for the doctor and the quality of patient care through of more informed decision making. When used in accordance with established ethical guidelines, computers offer a reliable, inexpensive, accessible, and time-efficient means of assessing psychiatric symptoms.",0,0,
431,Computer-based decision support for the management of pediatric asthma: description and feasibility of the Stop Asthma Clinical System,"Clinical guidelines can help in the management of asthma. Decision support systems (DSS) can improve adherence to clinical guidelines, but tend not to provide clinicians with clues for behavior change strategies to promote patient self-management. The Stop Asthma Clinical System (SACS) is a DSS designed for this purpose. To assess feasibility, seven clinicians used SACS to guide follow-up visits with 26 patients with predominantly persistent pediatric asthma. Data were collected through in-depth semi-structured interviews and surveys. SACS improved assessment of asthma severity and control, classification and intervention in environmental trigger and medication management problems, and development of an action plan (all p < 0.05). Doctor-patient communication was improved. The main challenge was that SACS increased the clinic visit time. SACS may improve physician behavior to improve patient self-management of asthma, but further studies are indicated to mitigate temporal limitations and assess the impact on physician and patient communication and behavior, as well as clinical outcomes.",0,0,
432,Computerized clinical decision support during medication ordering for long-term care residents with kidney failure.,"Objective: To determine whether a computerized clinical decision support system that provides real-time patient-specific recommendations improves prescribing quality for long-term care residents with renal failure. Design: Randomized trial within the long-stay units of a large long-term care facility. Randomization was within blocks by unit type. Alerts related to the prescription of medications for residents with renal insufficiency were shown to prescribers in the intervention units and hidden but tracked in the control units. Measurement: The proportions of final medication orders that were appropriate were compared between intervention and control units within alert categories: (1) recommended medication doses; (2) recommended administration frequencies; (3) recommendations to avoid the drug; (4) warnings Results: The rates of warnings were almost equal in the intervention and control units: 2.5 per 1000 days of residence in the intervention units and 2.4 in the control units. similar between intervention and control units (relative risk 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.83, 1.1) for the remaining alert categories, significantly higher proportions of final medication orders were appropriate in units intervention: relative risk 2.4 for maximum frequency (1.4, 4.4) ; 2.6 for medications to avoid (1.4, 5.0);"" and 1.8 for alerts to acquire missing information (1.1, 3.4).

433,Computerized community cholesterol control (4C): meeting the challenge of secondary prevention.,"Background: Dyslipidemia remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease. The Computer Based Clinical Decision Support System provides an opportunity to bridge these gaps. Objectives: To study the impact of computerized intervention in the secondary prevention of CAD[1]. Methods: The CDSS[2] was programmed to automatically detect CAD patients and assess the availability of an updated lipoprotein profile and lipid-lowering drug treatment. The program produced automatic computer-generated follow-up and treatment recommendations. Adjusted primary clinics were randomized to intervention (n = 56) or standard care (n = 56) arms. Reminders were sent to primary medical teams in the intervention arm every 4 months, updating them with current lipid levels and recommendations for further treatment. Compliance and lipid levels were monitored. The study group consisted of all CAD patients who were alive at least 3 months after hospitalization. Results: Follow-up was available for 7,448 patients with CAD (median 19.8 months, range 6 to 36 months). Overall, 51.7% of patients were adequately assessed and 55.7% of patients complied with recommended lipid-lowering treatment. A significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein levels was observed in both arms, but it was more pronounced in the intervention arm: 121.9 ± 34.2 vs. 124.3 ± 34.6 mg/dl (P < 0.02). A significantly lower rate of cardiac readmissions was documented in patients who received adequate treatment with lipid-lowering medications, 37% vs. 40.9% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This initial evaluation of our data represents a real-world snapshot in which clinicians and CAD patients often do not adhere to clinical guidelines, presenting a major obstacle to implementing effective secondary prevention. Our automated computerized reminder system makes compliance with the guidelines much easier and supports broad implementation.",0,1,
434,Computerized decision support based on a clinical practice guideline improves adherence to standards of care,"PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines are designed to assist in the management of specific diseases; however, these guidelines are often neglected in care delivery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clinicians' use of a clinical practice guideline would increase in response to having, at the patient visit, a decision support system based on a practice guideline that generates a protocol. personalized management for the individual patient using data from the patient's electronic medical record. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a 6-month controlled trial in a primary care clinical setting, 58 primary care physicians were randomized to receive a special encounter form with the guide's computer-generated recommendations or a standard encounter form. The effect of computer-generated advice on physician behavior was measured as the rate of adherence to guideline recommendations. Thirty physicians were analyzed; data from 28 physicians were excluded because these physicians did not meet predefined criteria for minimal exposure to diabetic patient care. RESULTS: The availability of patient management recommendations generated by the decisions resulted in a 2-fold increase in physician compliance with diabetes care guidelines (P = 0.01).Mean compliance for the group receiving the recommendations was 32.0% vs. 15% .6% of the control group CONCLUSION: Decision support based on a clinical practice guideline is an effective tool to assist physicians in the management of diabetic patients This decision support system provides a model of how a clinical practice guideline can be integrated into the process of care by computer to help clinicians manage a specific disease by helping them meet standards of attention. The use of decision support systems based on clinical practice guidelines could ultimately improve the quality of medical care.",0,1,
435,Computerized decision support for drug dosing in renal failure: a randomized controlled trial.,"Objective of the study Emergency physicians prescribe various discharge medications that require dose adjustment for patients with kidney disease. The hypothesis of this research was that decision support in a computerized physician order entry system would reduce the rate of medication overdosing for patients with kidney failure. Methods This was a randomized, controlled trial in an academic emergency department (ED), in which computerized physician order entry was used to write all prescriptions for patients being discharged from the ED. The sample included 42 physicians who were randomized to the intervention (21 physicians) or control (21 physicians) group. The intervention was a decision support that provided dosing recommendations for specific medications for patients older than 18 years when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance level was below the threshold for dose adjustment. The primary outcome was the proportion of targeted drugs that were overdosed. Results For 2,783 (46%) of the 6,015 patient visits, decision support had sufficient information to estimate the patient's creatinine clearance level. The average age of these patients was 46 years, 1,768 (64%) were women, and 1,523 (55%) were black. Decision support was provided 73 times to physicians in the intervention group, who overdosed 31 (43%) prescriptions.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: An academic emergency department (ED) in Indianapolis, Indiana, where computerized physician order entry was used to write all medication prescriptions. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three emergency physicians were randomly assigned to the intervention (32 physicians) or control (31 physicians) group. INTERVENTION: Support for the decision that advised against the use of nine potentially inappropriate drugs and recommended safer substitute therapies. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of emergency room visits by older people that resulted in one or more prescriptions for an inappropriate medication. The main secondary outcomes were the proportions of medications prescribed that were inappropriate and the intervention clinicians' reasons for refusing decision support. RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 74 years, two-thirds were women, and just over half were African-American. Decision support was provided 114 times to the intervening physicians, who accepted 49 (43%) of the recommendations. Intervention physicians prescribed one or more inappropriate medications during 2.6% of visits to the elderly emergency department, compared with 3.9% of visits managed by control physicians (P = .02; odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval = 0.34-0.89) The proportion of all medications prescribed that were inappropriate decreased significantly from 5.4% to 3.4%. inappropriate for older people.This approach could be used in other efforts to improve emergency room care.",1,1,

441,Consensus on guidelines for stereotactic neurosurgery for psychiatric disorders.,"BACKGROUND: For patients with psychiatric illnesses that remain refractory to ""standard"" therapies, neurosurgical procedures may be considered. Several local and regional expert groups have previously independently proposed guidelines for the safe and ethical performance of such procedures. METHODS: To build on these earlier documents, representative members of continental and international psychiatric and neurosurgical societies joined forces to develop and adopt a global pragmatic set of guidelines. These are intended to address a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, brain targets, and neurosurgical techniques, taking into account the cultural and social heterogeneities of healthcare settings. FINDINGS: The proposed consensus document highlights that while stereotactic ablative procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are considered ""established"" in some countries, they still lack level I evidence. Furthermore, it is noted that deep brain stimulation in any brain target tested so far, and for any psychiatric or behavioral disorder, still remains in an investigational stage. Investigators are encouraged to design evidence-based, science-based, randomized controlled trials for brain disease and target selection. Experienced multidisciplinary teams are a mandatory requirement for the safe and ethical performance of any psychiatric neurosurgery, ensuring documented patient refractoriness, proper consent procedures that respect patient capacity and autonomy, multifaceted preoperative and postoperative long-term follow-up evaluation and reports. of effects and side effects for all patients.

PARTICIPANTS: The 4 members of the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety were James C. Ballenger (chair), Jonathan RT Davidson, Yves Lecrubier, and David J. Nutt. Four professors invited by the president also participated: David S. Baldwin, Johan A. den Boer, Siegfried Kasper, and M. Katherine Shear. EVIDENCE: The consensus statement is based on the 6 review articles that are published in this supplement and the scientific literature relevant to these topics. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Group meetings were held over a period of 2 days. On Day 1, the group discussed each review document and the chair and commentator (Dr. Kasper) identified key issues for further discussion. On day 2, the group discussed these key issues to reach a consensus opinion. After the group meetings, the consensus statement was drafted by the chair and approved by all attendees. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus statement provides standard definitions for response and remission and identifies the appropriate strategy for managing panic disorder in a primary care setting.

Drug therapy should be slowly discontinued over a period of 4 to 6 months.",0,0,
443,Resource conservation theory and use of research in health systems,"Background Health systems face challenges in using research evidence to improve policy and practice. These challenges are particularly evident in small, under-resourced health systems, which are often located in places (in Canada and around the world) with poorer health status. Although organizational resources have been recognized as important for understanding research use, resource theories have not been a focus of knowledge translation (KT) research. What resources, in general terms, are required for KT and how does their presence or absence influence the use of research? In this article, we consider the conservation of resources theory (COR) as a theoretical basis for understanding the ability to use research evidence in health systems. Three components of COR theory are examined in the context of KT. In the first place, resources are required for the acceptance of the research. Second, the threat of resource loss encourages resistance to the use of research. Third, resources can be optimized, even in resource-constrained environments, to build capacity for KT. Methods A scan of the KT literature examined the organizational resources required for research use. A multiple case study approach examined the three components of COR theory described above. The multiple case study consisted of a document review and key informant interviews with members of the research team, including government decision makers and health professionals through a retrospective analysis of four applied health research studies conducted. previously in a region with limited resources. Results The literature scan identified organizational resources that influence the use of research. The multiple case study supported these findings, contributed to the development of a taxonomy of organizational resources, and revealed how fears related to resource loss can affect research use. Some resources were found to make up for other resource shortfalls. Resource needs differed at various stages of the research use process. Conclusions COR theory contributes to understanding the role of resources in research use, resistance to research use, and possible strategies to improve research use. Resources (and lack thereof) may explain the disparities observed in the acceptance of research in health systems. This document offers a theoretical foundation to guide a deeper examination of the COR-KT ideas and supports needed for using the research in resource-limited settings.",0,0,
444,Nurse education consultation for cardiovascular prevention - a 2-year randomized study,"The objective of this study was to increase the adherence of patients to the treatment of hypertension through in-office training of nurses. Thirty-three nurses were included in the study. In the intervention group (IG), 19 nurses participated in a 3-day residential training course on the Stages of Change model, Motivational Interviewing, and guidelines for cardiovascular prevention, recruiting 153 patients. Sixteen control group (CG) nurses recruited 59 patients. A decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was noted in both groups over the 2 years. Heart rate (p = 0.027), body mass index (p = 0.019), weight (p = 0.0001), waist (p = 0.041), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.0001), index waist-hip ratio (p = 0.024), and perceived stress (p = 0.001) were greatly decreased only in the IG. At 2 years, 52.6% of the patients in the IG (p = 0.13) reached the goal of </= 140/90 mmHg blood pressure compared to 39.2% in the CG. For self-reported physical activity, there was a significant difference (p = 0.021) between the groups. The beneficial effects of office training on patient weight parameters, physical activity, perceived stress, and the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure control emphasize office training and the use of behavioral models to motivate patients. patients to comply with treatment.",0,0,
445,Consumer satisfaction among patients and their general practitioners regarding the involvement of specialist nurses in the primary care of patients with urinary incontinence.,"BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common problem, but existing guidelines on UI are not followed. To align care with guidelines, an intervention to engage UI specialist nurses in primary care was planned and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Along with this intervention, we evaluated consumer satisfaction among patients and general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: Patients' satisfaction with care provided by specialist nurses (intervention group) or general practitioners (control group), respectively, was measured using a self-completed questionnaire. Physicians' views of nurse specialist involvement were measured in a structured telephone interview. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction score for specialist nurse care was 8.4 (scale 1-10), compared with 6.7 for usual GP care. More than 85% of patients would recommend the care of a specialist nurse to their best friends and 77% of GPs considered the role of the specialist nurse to be beneficial, with a mean score of 7.2. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample was relatively small and the stability of the results only tentatively established, the substitution of specialist nurse for GP UI care appears to be well received by both patients and GPs. Small changes such as providing additional UI-specific information and devoting more attention to UI (which had received little attention before) would provide a simple tool to encourage patients to change their behavior in the right direction.",0,0,

447,Contemporary Perspectives on Smoking Cessation: What Oncologists Need to Know,"In the past 5 years there has been a tremendous growth in research on smoking cessation, fueled in large part by the publication of the 1996 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Tobacco Use and Dependence. These federal guidelines published by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research offered comprehensive empirical evidence that smoking cessation interventions are effective and encouraged routine implementation within medical settings. Since then, numerous tobacco cessation studies have increased the state of knowledge about successful tobacco intervention modalities. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of cancer-related deaths continue to be attributed to smoking behavior. It is imperative that health care providers encourage and participate in the smoking cessation efforts of their patients and families. This article provides a review of the current literature on smoking cessation and describes first-line therapies with proven efficacy for smoking cessation. Physicians are encouraged to consistently assess tobacco use and provide brief interventions using behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapies to treat their patients' tobacco dependence.",0,0,
448,Contingency management to induce exercise in university students.,"Objective: The effects of contingency management to induce physical activity levels in seven physically inactive nonobese college students by providing monetary payments using a multiple baseline shift procedure were examined. Methods: Participants attended an initial phase, a subsequent intervention phase consisting of three exercise sessions per week for 4 weeks, and a follow-up session 2 weeks after the intervention. A total of $145 was available for attendance and exercise contingency payments. Results: The results indicate that all participants significantly increased exercise during the intervention from no activity at baseline to exercising for three 30-minute sessions per week. The participants maintained some gains during follow-up. Limitations: The study used a small and homogeneous sample size and required participants to exercise in a laboratory setting, which limited external validity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that incentive-based interventions are an effective and viable means of inducing exercise. (PsycINFO Database Registry (c) 2016 APA, All Rights Reserved)",0,0,
449,Continued driving habits of patients diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness,"OBJECTIVE: Description of driving behavior of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and the influence of diagnosis, therapy, guidelines and legal advice on their driving. DESIGN: Inventory based on questionnaires. SETTING: Center for Sleep and Wake Disorders, The Hague, The Netherlands. METHODS: All patients with EDS who were in a stable condition for at least 6 months after therapy were sent a questionnaire (n = 138). The questions concerned actual driving behavior, EDS, and the effects of diagnosis, therapy, and counseling provided by the Center. RESULTS: The response was 67% (n = 92). Eighteen patients had never driven a car. Eighteen of the other 74 patients stopped driving or drove less. Fifty-six patients did not change their behavior or drove further. There was little effect on driving behavior of diagnosis, therapy and advice to stop driving. CONCLUSION: EDS patients are often involved as drivers in modern traffic. Legal guidelines and medical advice have little influence on this behavior. Since general measures appear to be ineffective, approaches tailored to the individual patient may lead to more acceptable results.",0,0,
450,Controlled trial of an audit facilitator in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma in general practice.,"Objective: to test whether an audit facilitator could alter the pattern of diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma. Design: Stratified randomized controlled trial. Location: 12 general practices in Tayside. Subjects: 3,373 children aged 1 to 15 years inclusive who had symptoms suggestive of asthma or suspected asthma drawn from a systematic review of 10,725 general practice case records. Intervention: Children were screened for a clinical review by their general practitioner or practice nurses. Main outcome measures: Asthma-related consultations, prescriptions, hospital attendance, and health service costs 12 months before and after the study. Results: Compared with controls (n=1563), the intervention group (n=1585) had more practice-initiated asthma consultations (relative risk 2.18 (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 2 .73)), new diagnoses of asthma (2.83 (2.26 to 3.54) )), and previous diagnoses were reaffirmed (1.30 (1.08 to 1.58)), and they were prescribed with more frequently inhaled cromoglycate (1.52 (1.02 to 2.25)). Hospital day rates fell from 152 to 122 in the intervention group and increased from 69 to 117 in the control group between the year before and the year after the study. Total primary care costs increased from £30,118 to £37,243 in the intervention group and fell from £29,131 to £27,990 in the control group. The cost of hospital care fell in the intervention group from £25,406 to £20,727 and increased in the control group from £12,699 to £19,650. Conclusion: An audit facilitator may favorably influence diagnostic pattern and treatment of childhood asthma in general practice. This can have an impact on the costs of health services.",0,1,

452,Cooperation between occupational health insurance and physicians practicing occupational dermatology: potential for optimization in quality assurance,"BACKGROUND: Quality assurance is a task of the medical profession, but it is also a duty of occupational health insurance (OHI). Data on the quality of interaction between physicians practicing occupational dermatology and the OHI are limited. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey of 854 German members of the Working Group on Occupational and Environmental Dermatology was conducted in October 2013. Items included demographic data, a judgment on cooperation between dermatologists and OHI companies, an economic rating of the current compensation scheme and prioritization of optimization tasks. RESULTS: 182 members (21.3% of the invited population) participated in the survey. Cooperation with OHI companies was rated as ""very good"" by 10.8%, ""good"" by 56.7%, ""satisfactory"" by 24.2%, ""sufficient"" by 7, 0% and as ""inadequate"" by 1.3%. 93.4% of the interviewees mentioned problems and potential for improvement in the cooperation of their practice or clinic with the OHI companies. The main points of criticism were reimbursement (44.7%), followed by compromise of treatment options (36.5%) and delay or length of treatment in the dermatologist's procedure (29.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Although most physicians practicing occupational dermatology give a positive judgment of their cooperation with OHI companies, there are potentials for quality optimization regarding reimbursement of dermatological services, especially regarding counseling intensive in time in the prevention of occupational skin diseases, in the authorization of diagnosis and therapeutic procedures according to current guidelines and in a timely preventive intervention to take advantage of the therapeutic window before the chronification of skin diseases occurs. fur.",0,0,
453,Core Outcome Measures for Opioid Abuse Liability Laboratory Assessment Studies in Humans: IMMPACT Recommendations,"critical component in the development of opioid analgesics is the evaluation of their risk of abuse (AL). Standardization of approaches and measures used to assess AL has the potential to facilitate comparisons across studies, research laboratories, and medications. The goal of this report is to provide consensus recommendations regarding core outcome measures for evaluating the abuse potential of opioid medications in humans in a controlled laboratory setting. Although many of the recommended measures are appropriate for evaluating the AL of medications from other drug classes, the focus here is on opioid medications because they present unique risks to both physiological health (eg, respiratory depression, physical dependence) and for public health (eg, in pain) perspectives. A brief historical perspective on AL testing is provided, and then those measures that can be considered primary and secondary outcomes and potential additional outcomes in AL assessment are discussed. These outcome measures include the following: subjective effects (some of which comprise the primary outcome measures, including drug liking); physiological responses; drug self-administration behavior; and cognitive and psychomotor performance. Before presenting recommendations for standardized approaches and measures to be used in AL assessments, the appropriateness of using these measures in clinical trials with pain patients is discussed.",0,0,
454,Reduction of multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. Vendor Insights,"BACKGROUND: Although primary care physicians understand the importance of preventive services for patients with multiple risk factors (MRFs) for coronary heart disease, medical intervention is limited. This study investigated (1) clinicians' views on the challenges they face in managing patients with MRF; (2) the counseling and management methods they use; and (3) potential strategies to improve MRF intervention in the primary care setting. METHODS: Two Approaches Focus groups with primary care physicians from various settings were conducted to gain insight into these topics listed above. Each group was co-facilitated by a clinician and behavioral scientist using a previously developed semi-structured interview guide. Group discussions were recorded on tape and later transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method for analysis. RESULTS: Physicians face knowledge limitations (contribution of individual risk factors to overall risk); limited support (guidelines, materials, and staff);"" and logistical difficulties (organizational problems, time constraints). Their approach to managing MRF tends to be highly individualized with an initial preference for lifestyle change interventions over prescribing medications with some qualifying circumstances Clinicians favored a serial rather than parallel approach to MRF intervention, starting with behaviors perceived as a priority by the patient Proposed solutions to current challenges emphasize education of clinicians physicians and the development of innovative approaches that include medical assistance and a team approach CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are aware and sensitive to the complexity of managing MRF for their patients and themselves However, future MRF interventions will require the involvement of non-medical staff and increased systems support.",0,0,
455,"Management of coronary risk factors in primary practice in Shibuya, Tokyo","OBJECTIVES: Many large-scale clinical trials have confirmed that coronary risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus predict an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and that control of these risk factors reduces the incidence. However, the actual management of such risk factors and the resulting improvement in cardiovascular events in primary practice remains unclear. Heart Care Network Shibuya, a volunteer study group of regional primary care physicians, investigated coronary risk factor management and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Behavioral patterns of coronary risk factor management and resulting risk factor changes were investigated in 209 outpatients (mean age 65.6 +/- 11.2 years) with more than one hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus or previous myocardial infarction for 1 year. RESULTS: Prescriptions for antihypertensives (from 1.3 +/- 0.8 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 drugs per patient) and antihyperlipidemics (from 0.70 +/- 0.4 to 0.73 +/ - 0.4 drugs per patient) did not increase significantly. Patient education on diet (93% to 97%, p = 0.077), exercise (69% to 81%, p < 0.05), and not smoking (66% to 86%, p < 0.05) increased significantly after 1 year. Blood pressure decreased from 142 +/- 16/81 +/- 10 to 138 +/- 78/78 +/- 9 mmHg (p < 0.05), serum total cholesterol level decreased from 215 +/- 39 to 203 +/- 39 mg/dl (p < 0.05). As a result, more patients achieved the recommended treatment goals in the Japanese Society of Hypertension (34.6% to 46.8%) and the Japanese Atherosclerosis Society (40.2% to 49.5%) guidelines, respectively . However, none of the blood hemoglobin A1c levels, body mass index, or smokers changed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Regional physicians attempted to control all coronary risk factors. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are relatively more dependent on medical management, improved. In contrast, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or smoking, which require lifestyle changes, did not improve. The main issue in managing risk factors is how doctors act rather than specific actions.",0,0,
456,Economic consequences of implementing an electronic decision support system for ordering laboratory tests in primary care: evidence from a controlled prospective study in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: The economic consequences of interventions to promote rational and evidence-based use of laboratory tests by clinicians are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the economic consequences of a computer-based guideline decision support system (CDSS) for ordering blood tests in primary care. METHODS: We installed the CDSS in 118 practices [159 general practitioners (GPs)] in the Netherlands and calculated the costs of the intervention in this group. During a period of 6 months before and 6 months after the installation of the CDSS, the test requesting behavior of 87 (109 general practitioners) of these 118 study practices was studied and the results were compared with those of a control group. non-historical that did not receive the CDSS. In addition, the costs of laboratory requests for both groups were calculated. RESULTS: The total costs of the intervention, including development costs and installation costs, amounted to 79,000 euros (670 euros per visit). While the introduction of the CDSS did not affect the number of order forms sent to laboratories, it did reduce the number of blood tests per order form. As a result, the CDSS yielded an average cost savings for laboratory requests of 847 euros per practice for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that providing electronic decision support for ordering blood tests in primary care represents an economically promising concept. Laboratory cost savings are achievable and not offset by disproportionately high intervention costs.",1,1,
457,Profitability of a clinical decision support system based on the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia: report of a cluster randomized trial.,"Introduction and objectives To assess the cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for the Management of Hypercholesterolemia (ESCHM). Study Design and Perspective A pragmatic, unblinded, cluster-randomized trial was conducted. To assess the impact on effectiveness and costs of a CDSS implementing an adapted version of the ESCHM recommendations, a side-by-side comparison with a usual care group over 1 year was performed. The contract period began in April 2000 and ended 1 year later. Effectiveness was defined as achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction targets in patients with baseline cardiovascular (CVR) risk >20% at 10 years (LDL-C targets <115 mg /dL for patients with coronary heart disease [CHD], or LDL-C <130 mg/dL for patients without CHD), or maintaining CVR <20% at study end in patients with baseline CVR <20%. The costs of treatments, visits and laboratory tests were estimated from the social perspective (costing year 2002). Methods ESCHM guidelines adapted by a steering committee included therapeutic recommendations aimed at achieving LDL-C goals in a cost-effective manner. To promote healthy cardiovascular lifestyles, items such as placemats and refrigerator magnets (with relevant promotional messages) were distributed to intervention practices. All study doctors recorded patient data in a specific application installed on their computer. In the case of interventional physicians, the CDSS was installed as an add-on module to this application and they were prompted to use it, but were otherwise free to adopt or ignore the recommendations. Adherence to the guideline was monitored by the CDSS. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were selected from 44 general consultations in Spain, mainly in the region of Catalonia. Main outcome measures and results 2221 patients were included in the study (1161 in the usual care group and 1060 in the intervention group). The intervention was shown to be as effective as usual care, both in an unadjusted analysis and after adjusting for absolute CVR and previous treatment with lipid-lowering drugs (LLD) [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% CI 0.58, 1.77]. The intervention had no impact on lipid profiles. Intervention patients were prescribed LLD less frequently than usual care patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.26, 0.52; ""p = 0.0001), particularly when CVR was low.This induced significant savings in treatments (p = 0.0001) and total costs (p = 0.001), which were estimated at 24.9% and 20.8%, respectively.The intervention increased the number of laboratory tests. The recommendations issued by the CDSS were accepted in 71.3% of the visits.Discussion and conclusions The CDSS based on the recommendations of the ESCHM did not modify the efficacy of usual care, but it induced considerable savings.",0,1,
458,Cost-effectiveness of a manual-based coping strategy program for promoting the mental health of family caregivers of people with dementia (the START (STrAtegies for Relatives) study): a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the START intervention (STRATEGIES FOR RELATIVES) added to treatment as usual is cost-effective compared with treatment as usual alone. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis nested within a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTING Three mental health and one neurological dementia outpatient services in London and Essex, UK. PARTICIPANTS Family caregivers of people with dementia. INTERVENTION Eight-session manual-based coping intervention delivered by supervised psychology graduates to family carers of people with dementia added to treatment as usual, compared with treatment as usual alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Costs measured from a health and social care perspective were analyzed along with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-T) total score of affective symptoms and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in cost-effectiveness analysis for eight months from the start. RESULTS Of the 260 participants recruited for the study, 173 were randomized to the START intervention and 87 to treatment as usual alone. Mean HADS-T scores were lower in the intervention group than in the treatment-as-usual group over the 8-month evaluation period (mean difference -1.79 [95% CI -3.32 to - 0.33]), indicating better outcomes associated with the START intervention. There was a small improvement in health-related quality of life as measured by QALY (0.03 (-0.01 to 0.08)). Costs were not different between the intervention and treatment as usual groups (£252 (-28 to 565) higher for the START group). Profitability calculations suggested that START had a greater than 99% chance of being profitable compared to treatment as usual alone with a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY earned, and a high probability of profitability on the HADS-measure.

DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. CONTEXT Two subregions of the world defined epidemiologically by the World Health Organization: Sub-Saharan African countries with very high infant and adult mortality (AfrE)"" and Southeast Asian countries with high infant and adult mortality (SearD). DATA SOURCES Published studies , cost databases MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per capita and cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005. RESULTS Through 44 intervention strategies evaluated for For the five neuropsychiatric conditions, cost-effectiveness values differed by up to two orders of magnitude (from $Int100-250 to $Int10,000-25,000 for a year of healthy life gained) was the most costly and least cost-effective strategy The strategies most profitable in the Africa subregion were related to population-based alcohol control, while in the Southeast Asia subregion the The most cost-effective intervention was pharmacological treatment of epilepsy in primary care. The cumulative cost per capita of the most cost-effective set of interventions covering all five conditions was estimated to be $Int4.90-5.70. This package comprises interventions for epilepsy (older first-line antiepileptic drugs); depression (new generically produced antidepressants and psychosocial treatment); bipolar disorder (lithium mood stabilizer medication); schizophrenia (neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs and psychosocial treatment);"" and binge drinking (increased taxes and enforcement, reduced access and, in the African subregion, advertising bans and brief advice for heavy drinkers in primary care).

DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis or combined strategies for the control of vision and hearing loss using a population model for life. CONTEXT Two World Health Organization subregions of the world where vision and hearing loss are a major burden: Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. DATA SOURCES Biological and behavioral parameters from clinical and observational studies and population surveys. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005. OUTCOMES Chronic otitis media treatment, extracapsular cataract surgery, trichiasis surgery, meningitis treatment and Annual screening of schoolchildren for refractive error are among the most cost-effective interventions to control hearing and visual impairment, with a cost per DALY averted <Int$285 in both regions. Screening for hearing loss in both school-age children (annually) and adults (every five years) costs about $Int1,000 per DALY averted. These interventions can be considered highly cost-effective. Mass treatment with azithromycin to control trachoma can be considered cost-effective in the Africa sub-region, but not in the South-East Asia sub-region. CONCLUSIONS Control interventions for visual and hearing impairment are generally cost-effective. In deciding whether substantial investments in these interventions are warranted, this finding must be considered in relation to the economic attractiveness of other existing or new health interventions.",0,0,
461,Cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based intervention (AIMS) to improve adherence among HIV-infected patients: design of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Background Non-adherence to HIV treatment can have a negative impact on treatment success rates, quality of life, infectiousness and life expectancy of patients. Few adherence interventions have shown positive effects on adherence and/or virologic outcomes. The theory- and evidence-based Adherence Improving Self-Management Strategy (AIMS) is an intervention that has been shown to improve adherence and viral suppression rates in a randomized controlled trial. However, evidence of its cost-effectiveness is lacking. Following a recent review suggesting that cost-effectiveness evaluations of adherence interventions for chronic diseases are rare and that the methodology of such evaluations is poorly described in the literature, this manuscript presents the study protocol for a trial multicenter that evaluates the effectiveness and cost. -effectiveness of AIMS among a heterogeneous sample of patients. Methods/Design The study uses a multicentre randomized controlled trial design to compare the AIMS intervention with usual care from a social perspective. Embedded in this RCT is an economic evaluation based on tests and models. A planned number of 230 HIV-infected patients are randomized to AIMS or usual care. Relevant outcomes include changes in adherence, plasma viral load, quality of life, and societal costs. The time horizon for the trial-based economic evaluation is 12 to 15 months. Costs and effects are extrapolated to a lifetime horizon for model-based economic evaluation. Discussion This multicentre RCT is designed to provide robust methodological evidence regarding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based counseling intervention (AIMS) in supporting treatment adherence among a large and heterogeneous sample of HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands. The aim of the current document is to describe the trial protocol in sufficient detail to allow a full assessment of the quality of the study design. It is anticipated that, if shown to be cost-effective, AIMS may contribute to improving evidence-based counseling guidelines for HIV nurses and other health professionals.",0,1,
462,Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the initial medical management of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome: systematic review and decision analytic modeling,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and prioritize key areas of clinical uncertainty regarding the medical management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in current UK practice. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Consultations with clinical advisors. Postal survey of cardiologists. REVIEW METHODS: Potential areas of significant uncertainty were identified and ""decision problems"" were prioritized. A systematic review of the literature was carried out using standard methods. The decision model built consisted of a short-term phase that applied the results of the systematic review and a long-term phase that included relevant information from a UK observational study to extrapolate cost and effect estimates. Sensitivity analyzes were carried out to examine the dependence of the results on the reference parameters, using alternative data sources. Information expected value analysis was performed to estimate the expected value of perfect information associated with the decision problem. This provided an upper limit on the monetary value associated with further research in the area. RESULTS: Seven current areas of clinical uncertainty (decision problems) in the pharmacological treatment of patients with unstable angina were identified. The agents in question were clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, hirudin, and intravenous glycoprotein antagonists (GPAs). Twelve published clinical guidelines for unstable angina or non-ST elevation ACS were identified, but few contained recommendations on specified decision problems. The postal survey of physicians showed that there was the greatest disagreement for the use of small-molecule GPA, and the greatest uncertainty for decisions related to the use of abciximab (a large-molecule GPA). In general, decision problems related to the GPA drug class were considered to be of highest priority for further study. The selected articles describing the clinical efficacy of the treatment were divided into three groups, each representing an alternative strategy. The strategy involving the use of GPA as part of the initial medical treatment of all non-ST-segment elevation ACS was the optimal choice, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £5,738 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). ) compared with no use of GPA. Stochastic analysis showed that if the health service is willing to pay £10,000 per additional QALY, the probability of this strategy being profitable is around 82%, rising to 95% at a threshold of £50,000 per QALY. A sensitivity analysis that included an additional strategy of using GPA as part of initial medical treatment only in patients at particularly high risk (defined by age, ST depression, or diabetes) showed that this additional strategy was even more cost-effective, with an ICER £3,996 per QALY compared to no treatment with GPA. The value of data analysis suggested that there was considerable merit in additional research to reduce the level of uncertainty in the optimal decision. Using a threshold of £10,000 per QALY, the maximum potential value of such research in the base case was estimated at £12.7 million per year for the UK as a whole. Taking into account the increased uncertainty in sensitivity analyzes involving clopidogrel, this figure was increased to approximately £50 million. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the use of GPA in all patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS as part of their initial medical treatment. Sensitivity analysis showed that virtually all of the benefit could be obtained by treating only high-risk patients. Further clarification of the optimal role of GPAs in the UK NHS is dependent on the availability of more observational data and high-quality trials. The value of the data analysis derived from the model suggests that a relatively large investment in such research may be worthwhile. Further research should focus on identifying the characteristics of patients who benefit most from GPA as part of medical treatment, comparison of GPA with clopidogrel as an adjunct to standard care, cost-monitoring cohort studies and outcomes for high-risk patients. Non-ST elevation ACS over several years, and explore how clinicians' decisions combine an evidence-based normative decision model with their own personal behavioral perspective.",0,0,
463,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in primary care: an economic evaluation of the CoBalT trial.,"BACKGROUND: Depression is expensive to treat, but providing ineffective treatment is more expensive. Such is the case for many patients who do not respond to antidepressant medication. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression compared with usual care alone. METHOD: Economic evaluation at 12 months in conjunction with a randomized controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness assessed using a cost-consequence framework that compares the cost to the health and social care provider, patients, and society, with a range of outcomes. Cost-utility analysis comparing health and social care costs to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The mean cost of CBT per participant was £910. The difference in QALY gain between groups was 0.057, equivalent to 21 days per year of good health. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £14,911 (representing a 74% chance that the intervention would be cost-effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000 per QALY). Lost earnings and productivity costs were considerable, but there was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of CBT to usual care is cost-effective in patients who have not responded to antidepressants. Therefore, primary care physicians should be encouraged to refer these people for CBT.",0,0,
464,Cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments for low back pain: a systematic review.,"Health care costs for low back pain (LBP) are rising rapidly. Therefore, it is important to provide treatments that are effective and cost-effective. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments for low-back pain. Nine clinical and economic electronic databases and the reference list of relevant systematic reviews and included studies were searched for eligible studies. Economic evaluations conducted in conjunction with randomized controlled trials investigating treatments for low back pain supported by the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society guideline were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results and extracted the data. The extracted data included the type and perspective of the economic evaluation, the comparison treatments, and the relative cost-effectiveness of the comparison treatments. Twenty-six studies were included. Most studies found interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, or cognitive behavioral therapy to be cost-effective in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain. Massage alone is unlikely to be profitable. There were inconsistent results on the cost effectiveness of advice, insufficient evidence on spinal manipulation for people with acute low back pain, and no evidence on the cost effectiveness of medication, yoga or relaxation. This review found evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments for interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and cognitive behavioral therapy for subacute or chronic low back pain.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness and optimal administration conditions of PrEP for PWID. Design: Empirically calibrated dynamic compartmental model. Data sources: Published literature and expert opinion. Target Population: US PWID Adults. Time Horizon: 20 years and lifetime. improved provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people who become infected (PrEP+screen+ART). All scenarios are considered at 25% coverage. Outcome measures: infections averted, deaths averted, change in HIV prevalence, discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Base case analysis results: PrEP+screen+ART dominates other strategies, preventing 26,700 infections and reducing HIV prevalence among PWID by 14% compared to the status quo. Achieving these benefits costs $253,000 per QALY earned. At current drug prices, total expenditures for PrEP+screen+ART could be as high as $44 billion over 20 years. Sensitivity analysis results: The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is linear in the annual cost of PrEP and depends on the PrEP medication adherence, individual transmission risks, and community HIV prevalence. Limitation: Data on risk stratification and achievable efficacy levels of PrEP for PWID in the US are limited. benefits for the entire US population, but, at current drug prices, it remains an expensive intervention both in absolute terms and in cost per QALY gained.",0,0,
466,Cost-effectiveness of practice-initiated quality improvement for depression,"Context Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, but treatment rates in primary care are low. Objective To determine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of 2 quality improvement (QI) interventions to improve the treatment of depression in primary care and their effects on patient employment. Design Cluster-level randomized controlled trial conducted from June 1996 to July 1999. Setting Forty-six primary care clinics in 6 community-based managed care organizations. Participants One hundred eighty-one primary care physicians and 1356 patients with positive screening results for current depression. Interventions Matched practices were randomized to provide usual care (n = 443 patients) or to 1 of 2 QI interventions offering training for practice leaders and nurses, enhanced educational and assessment resources, and medication tracking nurses (QI-meds) ; n = 424 patients) or local trained psychotherapists (QI therapy; n = 489). Practices could flexibly implement interventions, which did not assign treatment type. Main outcome measures Total health care costs, costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), burden of depression days, and employment over 24 months, compared between usual care and the 2 interventions Outcomes Relative to usual care, mean health care costs increased $419 (11%) in QI-meds (P = 0.35) and $485 (13%) in QI-therapy (P = 0.28); estimated costs per QALY gained were between $15,331 and $36,467 for QI medications and $9,478 and $21,478 for QI therapy;"" and patients had 25 (P = 0.19) and 47 (P = 0.01) fewer days with burden of depression and were employed 17.9 (P = 0.07) and 20.9 (P = 0.03) more days during the study period.The social payoff of quality improvement efforts initiated in the practice for depression is comparable to that of accepted medical interventions.The effects of the intervention on employment may be of particular interest to employers and other stakeholders.",0,0,
467,Costs associated with implementing a computer-aided clinical decision support system for antenatal and delivery care: a case study from Kassena-Nankana district in northern Ghana,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the cost of implementing computer-assisted Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in selected health care facilities in Ghana. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kassena-Nankana district (KND). CDSS was implemented in selected health centers in KND as an intervention to manage patients attending antenatal clinics and the delivery room. CDSS users were primarily trained nurses. The activities and associated costs involved in the implementation of CDSS (pre-intervention and intervention) for the period 2009-2013 were collected from the perspective of the provider. The ingredient approach was used for cost analysis. Costs were grouped into personnel, training, overhead (recurring costs), and equipment costs (capital cost). We calculate the cost without annualizing the cost of capital to represent the financial cost and the cost with annualizing the costs of capital to represent the economic cost. RESULTS: Twenty-two trained CDSS users participated in the study (at least 2 users per health center). Between April 2012 and March 2013, users managed 5,595 prenatal clients and 872 work clients using the CDSS. A decrease in the proportion of complications during childbirth (pre-intervention 10.74% versus post-intervention 9.64%) and a reduction in the number of maternal deaths (pre-intervention 4 deaths versus post-intervention 1 death) were observed. The total financial cost of CDSS implementation was US$23,316, approximately US$1,060 per trained CDSS user. Of the total implementation cost, 48% (US$11,272) was pre-intervention cost and intervention cost was 52% (US$12,044). Equipment costs represented the largest proportion of the financial cost: 34% (US$7,917). When the economic cost was considered, the total cost of implementation was US$17,128, less than the financial cost by 26.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides useful information on the implementation of CDSS in health facilities to improve the adherence of health workers to practice guidelines and make accurate decisions to improve maternal health care.",0,0,
468,"Could clinical audit improve the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia?","OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of clinical auditing to improve the quality of diagnostic care provided to patients with suspected tuberculosis"";"" and understand the contextual factors that impede or facilitate their success. METHODS: Twenty-six health centers in Cuba, Peru, and Bolivia were recruited. Clinical audit was introduced to improve diagnostic care for patients presenting with suspected TB. The standards were based on WHO and TB program guidelines related to the appropriate use of microscopy, culture, and radiological investigations. At least two audit cycles were completed in 2 years. Improvement was determined by comparing performance between two six-month periods before and after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to determine the facilitating and limiting contextual factors influencing the change in clinical behavior of health professionals after the introduction of clinical audit. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement in 11 of 13 criteria in Cuba, in 2 of 6 criteria in Bolivia, and in 2 of 5 criteria in Peru. Twelve of the 24 audit criteria in the three countries met the agreed standards. Barriers to quality improvement included conflicting goals for clinicians and TB programs, poor coordination within the health system, and patients' attitudes toward the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical audit can drive improvements in the quality of clinical care in resource-poor settings. It is likely to be most effective if it is integrated into and supported by local TB programs.

469,African American Counseling for Hypertension (CAATCH) Trial: A Multitiered Intervention to Improve Blood Pressure Control in Hypertensive Blacks,"Despite strong evidence for effective interventions targeting blood pressure (BP) control, there is little evidence on the translation of these approaches into routine clinical practice in the care of hypertensive blacks. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel, multicomponent, evidence-based intervention compared to usual care in improving BP control among black hypertensives receiving care at community health centers. The primary outcomes are BP control rate at 12 months and maintenance of the intervention 1 year after the trial. Secondary outcomes are the patient's BP change from baseline to 12 months and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) is a cluster randomized clinical trial with 2 conditions: intervention condition and usual care. Thirty community health centers were equally randomly assigned to the intervention conditions group (n=15) or the usual care group (n=15). The intervention consists of 3 patient-directed components (interactive computerized hypertension education, home blood pressure monitoring, and monthly behavioral counseling on lifestyle modification) and 2 clinician-directed components (monthly case rounds). based on the National Joint Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment). of high blood pressure guidelines, chart auditing, and providing feedback on clinical performance and patients' home BP readings). All outcomes are evaluated at quarterly study visits for 1 year. The review of the graph is carried out at 24 months to assess the maintenance of the effects of the intervention and the sustainability of the intervention. Poor BP control is one of the main reasons for the mortality gap between blacks and whites. The findings of this study, if successful, will provide important information needed for the translation and dissemination of evidence-based interventions aimed at BP control in clinical practice for this high-risk population.",0,0,
470,Counseling African Americans to control hypertension: main effects of a cluster randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions aimed at blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive blacks receiving care in low-resource primary care practices. METHODS AND RESULTS: Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to intervention condition (IC) or usual care (UC). Patients at the HF centers received patient education, home BP monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, while physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on BP readings at home. home and audits of their patients' medical records. Patients and physicians at the UC sites received printed patient education material and hypertension management guidelines, respectively. The primary outcome was BP control, and the secondary outcomes were mean changes in systolic and diastolic BP at 12 months, assessed with an automated BP device. A total of 1,059 patients (mean age, 56 years; 28% men, 59% obese, and 36% with diabetes mellitus) were included. The BP control rate was similar in both groups (CI=49.3% versus CU=44.5%; odds ratio, 1.21 [95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.63]; P=0.21).In prespecified subgroup analyses, the intervention was associated with greater BP control in patients without diabetes mellitus (CI=54.0% vs. UC=44.7%; odds ratio, 1. 45 [confidence interval, 1.02-2.06]) and small community health centers (CI=51.1% versus UC=39.6%; odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1 .04-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent, practice-based intervention was no better than UC for improving BP control among black hypertensives. Future research on implementing behavior modification strategies for hypertension control in low-resource settings should focus on developing more efficient and personalized interventions in this high-risk population.

471,Creating a sustainable interprofessional team building program: first results,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of evaluating this program was to explore whether incorporating deliberate learning concepts, by using simulated patient scenarios to teach interprofessional collaboration skills to a health care team in a hospital acute care unit , it would improve the resuscitation response in the first 5 minutes in that unit. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a pilot program evaluation using a clinical unit nurse specialist in the delivery of an interprofessional educational program involving simulation on an acute medical floor in a large tertiary care hospital. SAMPLE: Eighty-four staff members participated in 17 drills. The sample included first-year internal medicine residents, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and patient care technicians. METHODS: This was a program evaluation using the TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Perceptions Questionnaire (T-TPQ) (class slides: TeamSTEPPS Essentials""; http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/education/ curriculum-tools/teamstepps/instructor/essentials/sessentials.html#s3) during pre-/post-simulation sessions to assess participants' perceptions of teamwork Expected intervention behaviors were collected through observations of participants participants in the simulations and compared to the American Heart Association guidelines (Circulation 2010;122:S685-S670, S235-S337).Participants' common perceptions of the experience were elicited through open-ended evaluation questions. : Fifty-three participants completed the pre- and post-T-TPQ Average scores in the leadership category of the T-TPQ decreased significantly (p = 0.003) from pre- st (median, 2.167) to posttest T-TPQ (median, 2.566), only 35% of groups administered a defibrillation during ventricular fibrillation. simulation scenario, and only 1 group delivered this shock within the American Heart Association's recommended 2-minute time frame (Circulation 2010;""122:S235-S337).

472,Creating spaces in intensive care for safe communication: a video-reflexive ethnographic study,"Background The built environment in acute care settings is a new focus in patient safety research, with few studies focusing primarily on the design of ward environments and the placement and choice of material objects, such as lighting fixtures and hand sinks. Methods We report on an interventional video-reflective ethnographic (VRE) study that explored how clinicians used the built environment to achieve safe communication in an intensive care unit (ICU) at a Sydney metropolitan hospital. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews, 5 weeks of observation, and four reflective focus groups with a total of 87 participants (including medical, nursing, health assistant, and administrative staff). Results We found that staff and patient accessibility in ICU open spaces was both a safety feature and a safety risk, allowing safe communication flow but also allowing potentially unsafe interruptions. Staff managed disruptions while allowing for a safe degree of accessibility by creating temporary protected spaces, using physical markers such as curtains, tape, and signs, as well as behavioral cues, movement, and developing policies that restrict activities in certain areas. Additionally, clinicians were able to use the VRE method to better understand their own practices and problems, and develop meaningful solutions for other problem spaces. Conclusions ICU staff enable secure communication on their wards by creating temporary spaces that are 'connected' and 'protected'. The flexibility of these ""soft"" strategies is especially well suited to the fast-paced clinical setting of critical care.",0,0,

Practice guidelines recommend that antenatal providers assess and counsel their patients about IPV, however many clinicians express reluctance or discomfort with such discussions. Health in Pregnancy (HIP) software was designed to improve counseling of prenatal providers about behavioral risks. METHODS: English-speaking women aged 18 years or older, less than 26 weeks pregnant and receiving prenatal care at one of five participating clinics in the San Francisco area, were randomized into parallel groups in a controlled trial. (June 2006-present) ;"", data analyzed June 2007). Participants who reported one or more risks were randomized to intervention or control in stratified blocks.

475,Cultivating a culture of learning in general practice: an educational intervention,"BACKGROUND: Increasing challenges are being faced in primary care, including the rise in chronic diseases and their management in the community. This document describes an educational initiative developed to help local general practitioners (GPs) and primary care teams manage chronic conditions and address referral behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initiative by exploring the experiences of participants and providers. METHODS: A variety of methods were used to collect data for the evaluation. These included participant feedback in the form of workshop evaluation questionnaires, semi-structured interviews of participants and presenters, and focus groups involving participants. RESULTS: Following data analysis, five themes were identified across all methods used. This document focuses on the key issues of 'practice change' and 'benchmark behaviour' in relation to the specific goals and objectives of the initiative. The data indicated that the participants had identified real changes in practice following their participation in the educational initiative, including changes in individual practice and prescribing behaviour, as well as in the provision of health care in the community. Identified changes in referral behavior were evident in feedback from participants and presenters in secondary care. Participants indicated the proposed changes, including an anticipated reduction in referrals to dermatology with increased management of conditions in primary care, as well as increased awareness of indications for early referral. The use of guidelines to assist in referral decisions was identified and the content and information required of referral letters was also a key area. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of this educational initiative has identified changes in practice in primary care and demonstrates how educational interventions can support and enhance future developments in primary care.",0,0,

DESIGN: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched to identify primary research articles evaluating interventions to prevent or manage chronic disease, tailored to Korean Americans, and published from 1980 to 2011. Of 238 articles identified, 21 articles describing 16 single intervention trials that met the inclusion criteria. These interventions targeted cancer (10), hypertension (2), diabetes (1), mental health (1), smoking cessation (1), and general health (1). RESULTS: All included studies were published since 2000, reflecting the relatively recent establishment of intervention research with Korean-Americans. All 16 programs delivered linguistically appropriate messages and education. The 11 programs that achieved significant intervention effects also provided or coordinated social support from culturally relevant and well-trained health workers, nurses, or lay family members during an intervention and/or follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally tailored and linguistically appropriate messages and education may not be sufficient to prevent or control chronic disease among Korean-American immigrants. Culturally sensitive and engaged social support should be provided to catalyze behavior change and maintain the effect of interventions.",0,0,

Ineffective management of transitional feeding problems can cause complications for the patient and may contribute to a longer length of stay. OBJECTIVES: Since many nurseries appear to vary in their neonatal feeding management practices, the aim of this study was to investigate and document the level of routine support and intervention currently provided to preterm infants with feeding problems. transition feeding at various levels II (special). care) nurseries (SCN) in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all SCNs in Queensland in 2005 (n=36). The questionnaire contained a series of short-answer, closed-choice questions designed to elicit information from each SCN regarding their current practices for managing transitional feeding problems in preterm infants. The results were confirmed during a follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 29 SCNs (80.6%). None of these nurseries reported having formal, written policies regarding the management of transitional feeding problems in preterm infants. Wide variations were reported in relation to breastfeeding assessments and interventions used by staff within the various SNAs. Of the 29 nurseries, 4 (13.8%) reported using checklists or assessments to judge readiness to breastfeed, and 5 (17.2%) reported using pulse oximetry to judge tolerance to breastfeeding attempts. to suckle Eighteen SCNs (62.1%) reported offering some type of active intervention to help newborns with transitional feeding problems, with the most common intervention techniques reported to be non-nutritive sucking during tube feedings, oral pre-feeding stimulation and active feeding stimulation.

METHODS: A prospective two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. Patients with osteoarthritis were eligible if they understood English and were referred for an initial total knee arthroplasty surgical consultation at a Canadian orthopedic joint evaluation clinic. Patients were randomized to the PtDA intervention or to usual education. The intervention was an osteoarthritis PtDA for the patients and a one-page preferences report that summarized the patients' clinical and decision data for their surgeon. The main feasibility outcomes were recruitment rates and questionnaire completion; preliminary effectiveness outcomes were waiting times and decision quality. RESULTS: Of 180 patients eligible for surgical consultation, 142 (79%) were recruited and randomized to the intervention of PTDA (n = 71) or usual education (n = 71). Data collection yielded a questionnaire completion rate of 93% with less than 1% missing items. After one year, 13% of patients remained on the surgical waiting list. off the waiting list (censored using survival analysis techniques) was 33.4 weeks for the PtDA group (n = 69, 95% CI: 26.0, 41.4) and 33.0 weeks for usual education (n=71, 95% CI: 26.1, 39.9) Patients exposed to PtDA had higher knowledge-based decision quality (71% vs. 47%; p<0.0001 ) and the quality decision was an informed choice that is consistent with their values for the option outcomes (56.4% vs. 25.0%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of patients with osteoarthritis considering surgery and data collection were feasible. Since some patients remained on the surgical waiting list after one year, follow-up should be extended to two years. Patients exposed to PtDA achieved higher decision quality compared to those receiving usual education, but there was no difference in waiting for surgery.

483,Decision making in the surgical treatment of chronic low back pain: performing prognostic tests to select patients for lumbar spinal fusion,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the leading causes of disability in the Western world with an enormous economic burden on society. To date, no specific underlying anatomic cause for CLBP has been identified. Imaging often reveals degenerative findings of the disc or facet joints of one or more lumbar motion segments. These findings, however, can also be seen in asymptomatic people. It has been suggested that pain in degenerated discs may be caused by nerve fiber ingrowth into tears or crevices of the annulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus, and by reported high levels of proinflammatory mediators. As this so-called discogenic pain is often exacerbated by mechanical loading, the concept of pain relief by spinal fusion has been developed to stabilize a painful spinal segment. For some patients, lumbar spinal fusion is indeed beneficial, but its results are highly variable and difficult to predict for the individual patient. To identify CLBP patients who will benefit from fusion, many surgeons rely on tests that are supposed to predict the outcome of spinal fusion. The three most commonly used prognostic tests in daily practice are immobilization in a lumbosacral orthosis, provocative discography, and trial immobilization by temporary external transpedicular fixation. In order to reach a consensus on the indications for lumbar fusion and improve its results through better patient selection, it is essential to understand the role and value of these prognostic tests for patients with CLBP in clinical practice. The general objectives of this thesis were: 1) to evaluate if there is a consensus among spine surgeons regarding the use and appreciation of prognostic tests for lumbar spinal fusion""; 2) to verify if a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) really minimizes lumbosacral motion; 3) to verify whether a TLSO can predict the clinical outcome of fusion for CLBP; 4) to assess whether provocative discography of adjacent segments actually predicts the long-term clinical outcome of fusion; 5) to determine the incidence of postdiscography discitis and whether there is a need for routine antibiotic prophylaxis; 6) to assess whether transpedicular temporary external fixation (TETF) can help predict the outcome of spinal fusion;"" 7) to determine the prognostic accuracy of the most commonly used tests in clinical practice to predict fusion outcome for CLBP. The results of a national survey among spine surgeons in the Netherlands were presented in Study I. Surgeons were asked about their opinion on prognostic factors and on the use of predictive tests for lumbar fusion in patients with CLBP. The comments were compared with the findings of the prevailing literature. The survey revealed a considerable lack of uniformity in the use and appreciation of predictive tests. Known prognostic factors from the literature were also not consistently incorporated into the surgeons' decision-making process. This heterogeneity in strategy is probably due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for current predictive tests and it was concluded that there is currently not enough consensus among spine surgeons in the Netherlands to create national guidelines for surgical decision making in CLBP. . In Study II, the hypothetical working mechanism of a trouser cast (ie, minimization of lumbosacral joint mobility) was studied. In patients admitted for a transpedicular temporary external fixation (TETF) trial, infrared light markers were rigidly affixed to the protruding ends of Steinman pins that were fixed at two spinal levels. In this way, the three-dimensional movement between these levels could be analyzed optoelectronically. During dynamic test conditions, such as walking, a cast, with or without unilateral hip fixation, did not significantly decrease lumbosacral joint motion. Although not supported by strong scientific support, lumbosacral orthoses or trouser casts are often used in daily practice as predictors of fusion outcome. A systematic review of the literature supplemented with a prospective cohort study (Study III) was conducted to assess the value of a trouser cast in surgical decision making. It appeared that only in CLBP patients without previous spinal surgery, a pantaloon cast trial with substantial pain relief suggests a favorable outcome of lumbar fusion compared with conservative treatment. In patients with prior spinal surgery, the test has no value. Many spine surgeons believe that provocative discography, unlike plain radiographs or MRI, is a physiological test that can actually determine if a disc is painful and relevant to a patient's pain syndrome, regardless of morphology. of the disk. It has been suggested that for a successful clinical outcome of lumbar fusion, suspect discs should be tender and adjacent control discs should be painless on provocative discography. For this reason, Study IV retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients in whom the decision to perform lumbar fusion was based on a trial of external fixation (ETFT). Preoperative discography results of only the levels adjacent to fusion were compared with clinical results after spinal fusion. It appeared that in this select group of patients, the discographic status of the discs adjacent to a lumbar fusion had no effect on clinical outcome. The most feared complication of lumbar discography is discitis. Although of low incidence, this is a serious complication for a diagnostic procedure and prevention through the use of prophylactic antibiotics has been recommended. In search of clinical guidelines, the risk of postdiscography discitis was evaluated in Study V using a systematic review of the literature and a cohort of 200 consecutive patients. Without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, an overall incidence of postdiscography discitis of 0.25% was found. To show that antibiotics actually prevent discitis, a randomized trial of 9000 patients would be needed to reach significance. Given the possible adverse effects of antibiotics, it is concluded that the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in lumbar discography is not indicated. In Study VI, the medium- and long-term results of external fixation (TETF) were studied as a test to predict the clinical outcome of lumbar fusion in a group of patients with back pain in whom there were doubts about the indication for lumbar fusion. Surgery. The trial included a placebo trial, in which patients were unaware whether lumbar segmental levels were fixed or dynamized. Using strict and objective criteria of pain reduction on a visual analog scale, the FTET test was unable to predict the clinical outcome of fusion in this select group of patients. Pin track infection and nerve root irritation were recorded as complications of this invasive test. It was concluded that in patients with chronic low back pain with a doubtful indication for arthrodesis, FTET is not recommended as a complementary tool for surgical decision-making. In Study VII, a systematic review of the literature was performed on the prognostic accuracy of tests currently used in clinical practice that are supposed to predict the outcome of lumbar spinal fusion for CLBP. The tests of interest were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TLSO immobilization, FTET, provocative discography, and facet joint infiltration. We were only able to select 10 studies that reported three different index tests (discography, TLSO immobilization, and FTET) that actually reported test qualifiers such as sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. The accuracy of all prognostic tests appeared to be low, confirming that in many clinical practices fusion is scheduled for patients on the basis of tests of insufficient or, at best, unknown accuracy. As the overall methodological quality of the included studies was poor, higher quality trials including fusion-negative and fusion-positive patients will be needed. We concluded that the best evidence does not currently support the use of any prognostic test in clinical practice. A subgroup of patients with low back pain for whom spinal fusion is a reliable and effective treatment could not be identified. In the literature, several studies have reported that cognitive behavioral therapy or intensive exercise programs have treatment outcomes similar to those of spinal fusion, but with considerably lower complications, morbidity, and costs. Since the findings of this thesis show that currently used tests do not improve fusion outcomes through better patient selection, these tests should not be recommended for surgical decision making in standard care. Furthermore, spinal fusion should not be proposed as a standard treatment for chronic low back pain. The causality of nonspecific spinal pain is complex and CLBP should not be considered as a diagnosis, but as a symptom in patients with different stages of impairment and disability. Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting or Spine Center according to the so-called biopsychosocial model, which aims to identify underlying psychosocial factors as well as biological factors. Treatment should occur in a staggered manner beginning with the least invasive treatment. The current CLBP approach, which emphasizes self-management and empowerment of patients to take an active course of treatment, is recommended in order to prevent long-term disability and chronicity.",0,0,

486,Default options in the ICU: widely used but insufficiently understood,"Purpose of the review Default options dramatically influence the behavior of decision makers and can serve as effective decision support tools in the ICU. Its use in medicine has increased in an effort to improve efficiency, reduce errors and harness the potential of health technology. Recent Findings Default values often fall short of their intended influence when used in critical care settings as quality improvement interventions. Research reporting the use of default values is often limited by variations in relative effect between sites. Pre-implementation experiments and long-term follow-up studies are lacking. Summary Defaults in the ICU can help or hurt patients and clinical efficiency depending on their format and use. When building and finding noncompliance, providers must be aware of their powerful and complex influences on decision making. Additional evaluations of the appropriate creation of healthcare breaches and their resulting intended and unintended consequences are needed.

487,The default configuration of computerized physician order entry system order sets drives ordering habits.,"Background: Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems are rapidly becoming ubiquitous, and order groups (""order sets"") to allow easy order entry are a common feature. This provides a simplified mechanism for viewing, modifying, and placing groups of related orders. This often serves as an electronic equivalent of a specialty application. One feature of these order sets is that specific orders can be predetermined to be ""pre-selected"" or ""default on"" whenever the order set is used, while others are ""optional"" or ""default off"" (although usually the option is to ""deselect"" the default tests in a given situation). While it seems intuitive that defaults in an order set are often accepted, further study is required to understand the impact of these ""default"" settings in an order set on ordering habits. This study set out to quantify the effect of changing the default configuration of a set of orders. Methods: In order to improve quality, transfusion-related order sets were recently reviewed and modified to improve outcome tracking. Initially, the default settings for post-transfusion hematocrit and platelet count changed from ""optional"" to ""preselected."" study the effect of predetermined selections from an ordering set on physicians' ordering habits. Results: Post-transfusion hematocrit values were ordered for 8.3% of RBC transfusions when the default order set selection was ""off"" and for 57.4% of transfusions when the default selection was ""preselected."" "" (P < 0.0001). Post-transfusion platelet counts were ordered for 7.0% of platelet transfusions when the initial default order set selection was ""optional"", increased to 59.4% when the default was changed to ""pre-selected"" (P < 0.0001) and then decreased to 7.5% when the default selection was returned to 'optional'. Post-transfusion platelet count rates during the two ""optional"" periods, 7.0% vs. 7.5%, were not statistically different (P = .620). Discussion: Default settings in CPOE order sets can significantly influence physician selection of laboratory tests. Careful consideration should be obtained from all stakeholders, including physicians and pathologists, when setting default settings in order sets.",1,1,
488,Defensive medicine among high-risk specialist physicians in a volatile malpractice environment,"Context How often physicians alter their clinical behavior due to the threat of medical malpractice liability, called defensive medicine, and the consequences of those changes, are central questions in the current debate over medical malpractice reform. Objective To study the prevalence and characteristics of defensive medicine among physicians practicing in highly responsible specialties during a period of great instability in the malpractice environment. Design, Setting, and Participants Mail survey of physicians in 6 high-risk litigation specialties (emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology) in Pennsylvania in May 2003. Main outcome measures Number of physicians in each specialty reporting defensive medicine or changes in scope of practice and characteristics of defensive medicine (safety and avoidance behavior). Results A total of 824 physicians (65%) completed the survey. Nearly all (93%) reported practicing defensive medicine. ""Safety behavior"" such as ordering tests, performing diagnostic procedures, and referring patients for consultation was very common (92%). Among defensive medicine professionals who detailed their most recent defensive act, 43% reported using imaging technology in clinically unnecessary circumstances. Avoidance of procedures and patients that were perceived to increase the likelihood of litigation was also widespread. Forty-two percent of respondents reported taking steps to restrict their practice in the previous 3 years, including eliminating complication-prone procedures such as trauma surgery and avoiding patients who had complex medical problems or who were perceived to be as litigation. Defensive practice was strongly correlated with respondents' lack of confidence in their liability insurance and the perceived burden of insurance premiums. Conclusion Defensive medicine is very prevalent among Pennsylvania physicians who pay the most for liability insurance, with potentially serious implications for cost, access, and the technical and interpersonal quality of care.",0,0,
489,Definition of optimal treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease,"Despite the growing recognition that Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global public health and social care crisis, diagnosis is often slow and many patients still do not receive any treatment. Of those who do receive treatment, many remain on lower-than-recommended doses. The International World Charter for Alzheimer's Disease promotes awareness and understanding of AD, highlighting the importance of optimal treatment. However, the definition of ""optimal treatment"" is not clear. Since cholinesterase inhibitors became available nearly 20 years ago, clinicians have developed a variety of protocols based on clinical experience. This review considers what is optimal for various aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, taking into account initiation strategies, doses, modes of drug administration (eg, oral versus transdermal), and duration of treatment. treatment. Regardless of the management approach, people with AD, their families and carers have the right to timely diagnosis and access to the best available treatment.",0,0,
490,Well Child Care Service Delivery: A Look Through the Door,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the provision of well-child care and its components; compare that benefit to Bright Futures recommendations; and compare the provision of well-child care for children with special health care needs with that for children without special needs. METHODS: Over a 10-week period, 2 medical students observed and documented the characteristics of well-child visits performed by general pediatricians and mid-level pediatric providers. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and an assessment for children with special health care needs. RESULTS: A total of 483 visits from 43 pediatricians and 9 mid-level providers with patients 0 to 19 years of age. The adjusted mean length of visit was 20.3 minutes; 38.9% of visits began with an open question about parent/child concerns. 7.2 Health Monitoring/Advance Counseling Topics Addressed Per Visit Physicians addressed an average of 42% of Bright Futures recommended age-specific health monitoring participatory counseling topics. Topics addressed less frequently than recommended included family support, parental well-being, behavior/discipline, physical activity, media screen time, risk reduction/substance use, puberty /sex, social interactions with peers and violence. Shorter visits were associated with questions about parent/child concerns and with addressing a higher proportion of recommended health supervision/advance guidance topics. Child wellness visits with children with special health care needs were 36% longer than those with children without special needs and addressed a similar number of age-specific anticipatory guidance/health supervision topics. More time was devoted to children with special health care needs, covering health supervision/advance guidance, other conditions (usually their chronic condition), and tests, prescriptions, and referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Using direct observation of visits with pediatric physicians, we found that parent/child solicitation of concerns occurred less frequently than recommended. Fewer than half of the recommended visit-specific health monitoring/preventive counseling topics were addressed, and there was little consistency with some Bright Futures age group-specific recommendations. Notably, both patient/parent request for concerns and greater adherence to health supervision recommendations/anticipatory guidance were associated with shorter visits. Well child follow-up visits with children with special health care needs were longer than those with children without special needs; more time was spent addressing a similar number of health monitoring/advance guidance topics, as well as their chronic conditions.",0,0,
491,Demand management for planned care: a realistic synthesis.,"Â Matching fluctuating demand with available capacity is one of the basic challenges in all large-scale service industries. It is a particularly pressing concern in modern health systems, as increasing demand (population aging, availability of new treatments, increased patient knowledge, etc.) meets supply stagnation (capacity and funding constraints). in staff and services, etc.). As a consequence, a very large portfolio of demand management strategies has been developed based on quite different assumptions about the origin of the problem and about the means of its resolution. This report presents a substantial review of the effectiveness of major strategies designed to alleviate demand pressures in the area of planned care. The study begins with an overview of the key insights into the genesis of health service demand and capacity problems. Many different diagnoses were discovered: fluctuating demand meeting ""stationary capacity""; territorial protection between different providers; social rather than clinical pressures on referral decisions; self-propelling diagnostic cascades; provider-induced demand; demographic pressures on treatment; and the informed patient and demand inflation. We then conducted a review of the key ideas (program theories) underlying interventions designed to address demand imbalance. We found that there was not a close alignment between the alleged problems and the advocated solutions Demand management interventions have their starting point in seeking reforms at the levels of strategic decision-making, organizational reengineering, procedural modifications, and behavioral changes Mapping ideas for reform, we also noted a trend because the theories of program become ""whole system"" models; need for concerted action on all these fronts. The remainder and core of the report contains a realistic synthesis of the empirical evidence on effectiveness across a broad subset of four main demand management interventions: referral management centers (RMCs); use General Practitioners with Special Interests (GPwSI) at the interface between primary and secondary care; general practitioner (GP) direct access to clinical trials; and referral guidelines. In all cases we find a checkered pattern of success and failure. The primary literature is replete with accounts of unforeseen problems and unintended effects. These programs 'work' only under very limited conditions. To give brief examples, we find that the success of RMCs crucially depends on the balance of control in their governance structures; The GPwSIs influence the lawsuit only after close negotiations on an intermediate and agreed mix of cases; significant efficiencies are created by direct GP access to testing, particularly where there is low diagnostic throughput and high 'discard' rates;"" and referral guidelines are more likely to work when implemented by staff responsible for their care. creation. The report concludes that there is no ""preferred intervention"" that has the ability to outperform all others. Instead, the review found many hard-won, local, and diverse adaptive solutions. Whatever the point of Starting off, success in demand management depends on the synchronization of a complex series of strategies, organisational, procedural and motivational changes.The last chapter offers practitioners a guide on how they might 'think through' all the interdependencies that balance demand and capacity A detailed analysis of the implementation of different configurations of interventions of demand management in different local contexts using mixed methods would be valuable to understand the processes through which such intervention actions are adapted to local circumstances. There is also scope for further synthesis of the evidence. Substitution theory is ubiquitous in health and social care and a realistic synthesis for comparing the fortunes of different professionals located at different professional boundaries (for example, nurses/physicians, dentists/dental care professionals, radiologists/radiographers, etc.) would be valuable in identifying the contexts and mechanisms through which substitution, support, or short-circuiting occurs.

492,Dementia care management: breaking new ground in ambulatory dementia care within a GP-based randomized controlled intervention trial,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia is a major challenge for the German healthcare system. The DelpHi-MV (""Dementia: Life- and Person-Centered Support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania"") study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative subsidiary support system for people with dementia (PwD) living at home and their carers . METHODS: DelpHi-MV is a GP-based cluster-randomized controlled intervention trial. DelpHi-Intervention aims to provide ""optimal care"" by integrating multiprofessional and multimodal strategies to individualize and optimize dementia treatment within the framework of the established health care and social services system. The intervention is delivered by Dementia Care Managers (DCMs), nurses with specific training in dementia, in people's homes. Based on the German guidelines for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of dementia, a comprehensive set of 95 intervention modules, the ""DelpHi-Standard"", was defined. Each module consists of predefined trigger conditions, a post-intervention task, as well as at least one criteria for its completion. The intervention begins with a comprehensive assessment of the care situation, needs and resources. The DCM develops and implements an intervention plan tailored to individual conditions in close collaboration with the GP. EXPECTED RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We expect statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups in the primary outcomes (quality of life, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, pharmacotherapy, caregiver burden). The results may provide evidence of the effectiveness and efficacy of dementia care management according to the ""Delphi-Standard"", prerequisites for implementing this concept in routine medical care.",0,0,

495,Design and evaluation of a computer reminder system to improve the prescription behavior of general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a decision support system with reactive computer reminders to improve medication prescription behavior. METHODS: A clustered RCT with incomplete block design was conducted in the south of the Netherlands: 25 physicians received antibiotic and asthma/COPD prescription reminders, 28 physicians received cholesterol prescription reminders. The prescription guidelines were integrated into the GP information system, which was installed in the GP practices of the intervention group. When the computer program was in use, a reminder would appear if the GP deviated from the guidelines during prescribing. PRIMARY OUTCOME: guideline prescription as a percentage of total prescriptions for a specific drug. In addition, an evaluation of the ease of use of the CRS in GP practice was carried out through questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: Analyzes are currently underway. Preliminary results indicate that the CRS study supported our expectations. In general, there seems to be a reduction in the number of prescriptions according to the advice of the computerized guidelines not to prescribe certain drugs. The final analysis will be done shortly. In general, the Computer Reminder System was perceived as stable and easy to use. CONCLUSION: We created a stable and easy-to-use Computerized Reminder System that was adjusted to the needs and demands of GPs. Preliminary results on the effectiveness of the system seem to indicate that the implementation of a Computer Reminder System with reactive reminders improves medication prescription behavior.",0,1,
496,Design and implementation of training to improve the management of pediatric overweight,"INTRODUCTION: Physicians report low competence in the treatment of overweight children and the use of behavior management strategies. This document documents the design and implementation of a training program to improve clinicians' skills in the assessment and behavioral management of pediatric overweight. METHODS: Two one-hour CME trainings were designed using published guidelines, research results, and expert committee recommendations. The trainings were delivered to physicians in a pediatric managed care department, using innovative assessment and counseling tools and interactive exercises. Surveys and focus groups were conducted 3 and 6 months after the intervention to examine clinicians' attitudes and practices regarding screening and counseling tools. RESULTS: Post-intervention, most clinicians agreed that the Pediatric Obesity Practice Resource and BMI-for-age percentile provided useful information for clinical practice. Physicians reported increased use of recommended screening tools and changes in office practices to implement these tools. They offered suggestions to improve the ease of use of the tools and to overcome the barriers perceived by the doctor and/or the patient. DISCUSSION: Brief, cost-effective, multifaceted training and provision of counseling tools was perceived as useful for clinical practice. Useful lessons were learned about the design of tools and ways to adapt them to practice. Training the entire health team is advantageous for the adoption of new tools and practices.",0,0,
497,Design and Methods of the Echo WISELY (Will Inappropriate Scenarios for Echocardiography Will Significantly Decrease) Study: An Investigator-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial of Education and Feedback Intervention to Reduce Inappropriate Echocardiograms,"BACKGROUND: The appropriate use criteria (AUC) for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were developed to address concerns about the inappropriate use of TTE. An earlier pilot study suggests that an educational and feedback intervention can reduce inappropriate TTEs ordered by trainees. Whether this type of intervention will be effective when targeted at attending-level clinicians in a variety of clinical settings is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this international multicenter study is to test the hypothesis that an educational and feedback intervention based on AUC will reduce the proportion of inappropriate echocardiograms requested by treating physicians in the outpatient setting. METHODS: An ongoing multicenter, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial in Canada and the United States will enroll cardiologists and primary care physicians practicing in the outpatient setting. The intervention arm will receive (1) a lecture describing AUC and the latest available evidence highlighting the appropriate use of TTE, (2) access to the American Society of Echocardiography mobile phone app, and (3) reports from individualized feedback emailed monthly summarizing TTE ordering behavior, including information about inappropriate TTEs and brief explanations of inappropriate designation. The control group will receive no education on the appropriate use of TTE and will request TTE as standard practice. CONCLUSIONS: The Echo WISELY (Will Inappropriate Scenarios for Echocardiography Lessen Significantly in an education RCT) study is the first multicenter randomized trial of an educational intervention based on AUC. The study will examine whether an education and feedback intervention will reduce the rate of inappropriate outpatient TTEs ordered by level-of-care cardiologists and primary care physicians (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02038101).",0,0,
498,Design factors for the success or failure of guideline-based decision support systems: a hypothesis involving the complexity of the case,"Computer-based decision support systems (CDSS) today are mostly reminder systems. However, the effectiveness of such systems in modifying physician behavior is not always observed. We assume that this approach is appropriate when doctors believe they know how to prescribe and do not need help, that is, for simple clinical cases. In contrast, on-demand approaches that allow flexibility in interpreting patient conditions are more appropriate for more complex cases, for example, in the management of chronic diseases. ASTI is a CDSS that operates in two modes, a critique mode that works as a reminder-based system, and a user-initiated guidance mode. Using a clinical case complexity score, a pre/post-intervention experiment was conducted with 10 GPs and 15 hypertensive patient cases. Preliminary results tend to indicate that reminder-based interaction is appropriate for simple cases and that clinicians are willing to use on-demand systems as clinical situations become complex, making both modes complementary.",1,1,

A staged model of organizational structures and practices is used, ranging from local autonomy to formal controls to open inquiry and deepen self-understanding, to illustrate typical challenges and design possibilities at each stage. We suggest how organizations can use the concepts and examples presented to increase their ability to self-design for security and reliability.",0,1,
500,"Design of the Balance@Work project: development, evaluation and systematic implementation of an occupational health guide aimed at the prevention of weight gain among employees","BACKGROUND: Occupational health professionals can play an important role in preventive health promotion activities for employees. However, due to a lack of knowledge and evidence- and practice-based methods and strategies, interventions are hardly being implemented by occupational physicians to date. The objective of the Balance@Work project is to develop, evaluate and implement an occupational health guideline aimed at preventing weight gain among employees. METHODS: Following the Dutch Society for Occupational Medicine guideline development protocol and the Intervention Mapping protocol, the guideline was developed based on the literature, interviews with relevant stakeholders, and consensus among a group of experts. The guideline consists of an individual and an environmental component. The individual component includes recommendations for occupational physicians on how to promote physical activity and healthy eating behavior based on motivational interviewing principles. The environmental component contains an obesogenic environment assessment tool. The guideline is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial among 20 occupational physicians. Occupational physicians in the intervention group apply the guideline to eligible workers for 6 months. Occupational physicians in the control group provide care as usual. Measurements are made at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months later. Primary outcome measures include waist circumference, daily physical activity, and dietary behavior. Secondary outcome measures include sedentary behaviour, determinants of behavior change, body weight and body mass index, cardiovascular disease risk profile and quality of life. In addition, productivity, absenteeism and profitability are evaluated. DISCUSSION: Improving workers' daily physical activity and dietary behavior can prevent weight gain and subsequently improve workers' health, increase productivity, and reduce absenteeism. After an evaluation of the effect and the process, the guideline will be adjusted and, after authorization, published. Along with various implementation aids, the published guideline will be widely disseminated by the Dutch Society for Occupational Medicine. TEST REGISTRATION: ISRCTN73545254/NTR1190.",0,0,
501,"Design, implementation and evaluation of a knowledge translation intervention to increase organ donation after cardiocirculatory death in Canada: a study protocol","Background The shortage of transplantable organs is a worldwide problem. There are two types of organ donation: living and deceased. Deceased organ donation can occur after neurological determination of death (NDD) or cardiocirculatory death. Cardiocirculatory donation after death (DCD) represents the largest increases in deceased organ donations worldwide. However, there are variations in the use of DCDs within Canada and around the world. The reasons for these discrepancies are largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based knowledge translation intervention to provide practical guidance on how to increase the number of DCD organ donors without reducing the number of standard NDD donors. Methods We will use a three-step mixed method. In step one, we will conduct semi-structured interviews, informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, to identify and describe stakeholders' beliefs and attitudes about DCD and their perceptions of multilevel factors influencing DCD. We will identify: determinants of the evidence-practice gap""; specific behavior changes and/or process changes needed to increase DCD; specific group(s) of clinicians or organizations (e.g. donor organizations provinces) who need a change in behavior;"" and specific goals for interventions. In step two, using the principles of intervention mapping, we will develop a theory-based knowledge translation intervention encompassing behavior change techniques to overcome identified barriers and enhance DCD enablers. In step three, we will implement the intervention in hospitals across all 10 Canadian provinces and assess its efficacy using a multiple interrupted time series design. Discussion We will take a behavioral approach to defining and testing novel, theory-based and ethically acceptable knowledge translation strategies to increase the number of available DCD organ donors in Canada. If successful, this study will ultimately lead to more transplants, reducing patient morbidity and mortality at the population level.",0,0,
502,Designing a patient-centered personal health record to promote preventive care,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based preventive services offer important health benefits, but Americans receive only half of the indicated care. A variety of government and specialist society policy initiatives are promoting the adoption of information technology to engage patients in their care, such as personal health records, but current systems may not utilize the technology's full potential. . METHODS: Using a model described above to make information technology more patient-centric, we developed an interactive preventive health record (IPHR) designed to more deeply engage patients in preventive care and health promotion. . We recruited 14 primary care practices to promote the IPHR to all adult patients and sought practice and patient input in the design of the IPHR to ensure its usability, prominence, and generalizability. Input involved patient usability testing, practice workflow observations, learning collaborations, and patient feedback. Use of the IPHR was measured using practice citations and IPHR databases. RESULTS: The IPHR that emerged from this process generates personalized recommendations for patients based on guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other organizations. It extracts clinical data from the electronic medical record of the consultations and obtains information on risk assessment for the health of patients. The clinical content is translated and explained in common language. The recommendations review the benefits and uncertainties of services and possible actions for patients and physicians. Recommendations include self-management tools, risk calculators, decision aids, and community resources, selected to fit the patient's clinical circumstances. At six months, the practices had encouraged 14.4% of patients to use the IPHR (ranging from 1.5% to 28.3% across the 14 practices). Practices successfully incorporated the IPHR into the workflow, using it to prepare patients for visits, augment behavioral health counseling, explain test results, automatically issue reminders to patients about overdue services , inform doctors about the necessary services and formulate personalized prevention plans. CONCLUSIONS: The IPHR demonstrates that a patient-centered personal health record that interfaces with the electronic medical record can provide patients with a high level of individualized guidance and be successfully adopted by busy primary care practices. Further studies and improvements are needed to make information systems even more patient-centric and to demonstrate their impact on care.

503,Design of a valid randomized pragmatic primary care implementation trial: the my own health report (MOHR) project,"Background There is a pressing need for increased attention to patient-centred health behavior and psychosocial problems in primary care, and for practical tools, study designs, and outcomes of clinical and policy relevance. Our goal is to design a scientifically rigorous and valid pragmatic trial to assess whether primary care practices can systematically implement patient-reported information collection and provide patients with the necessary counselling, goal-setting, and counseling in response. Methods This manuscript reports the iterative design of the My Own Health Report (MOHR) study, a cluster-randomized delayed intervention trial. Nine pairs from various primary care practices will be randomly assigned to early or late intervention four months later. The intervention consists of presenting the MOHR assessment ¨C addresses 10 domains of health behaviors and psychosocial problems ¨C and the subsequent provision of the necessary counseling and support for patients presenting for wellness or chronic care. As a pragmatic participatory trial, stakeholder groups, including practice partners and patients, were engaged throughout the study design to take into account local resources and characteristics. Participatory tasks include identifying the content of the MOHR assessment, refining the study design, providing information on outcome measures, and designing the implementation workflow. Study outcomes include scope of intervention (percentage of patients offered and completing MOHR assessment), effectiveness (patients reporting being asked about issues, setting goals for change, and receiving assistance in early versus late intervention practices) , contextual factors that influence the results and intervention costs . Discussion The MOHR study shows how a participatory design can be used to promote the consistent collection and use of patient-reported psychosocial and behavioral health assessments in a wide range of primary care settings. While pragmatic in nature, the study design will allow valid comparisons to answer the stated research question, and the findings will be broadly generalizable to a variety of primary care settings. According to the Pragmatic Explanatory Continuous Indicators Summary (PRECIS) framework, the study design is substantially more pragmatic than other published trials. The methods and findings should be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers trying to make health care more patient-centered and relevant.",0,1,
504,Detection and management of alcohol use disorders in German primary care influenced by non-clinical factors.,"OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to assess the proportion of patients correctly detected and referred in German primary care. The secondary objective was to identify patient and provider characteristics that predict detection and correct referral. METHODS: In this pooled cross-sectional survey in German primary care, 3003 patients were consecutively invited to participate and asked to complete a standardized health questionnaire. They were then assessed for problematic alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Physicians recorded their assessment of the presence of any alcohol use disorder and documented the course of treatment for all identified patients for 3 months. RESULTS: Correctly identified problem drinkers were 38.6% in a per protocol analysis and 33.6% using the worst case scenario. Physicians' referral behavior was in accordance with current practice guidelines in 64.6% of documented cases and in 27.0% in the worst case. Various patient (eg, gender, age) and physician (eg, age) characteristics could be identified, influencing the diagnosis and referral of patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need to increase the special diagnostic and therapeutic skills of general practitioners so that they can indicate and perform secondary prevention. Further research should focus on the likely effects of implementing these diagnostic and management tools.",0,0,

Results (health impact, system impact, implemented programs, engagement, user perception, and financial leverage) and explanatory factors will be collected through an online survey, interviews, and record review. A panel of independent experts will make judgments about the impact or scope of each network's initiatives on health and system impacts. The scores of the expert panel will be the result used in the multivariate analyses. Following the rating of network success, a qualitative study will be conducted to provide a deeper examination of the most successful networks. Discussion This is the first study to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the factors that contribute to the success of clinical networks and, more generally, it is the largest study of clinical networks conducted. The adaptation of expert panel methods to qualify the impacts of networks is the methodological innovation of this study. The proposed project will identify the conditions that should be established or fostered by agencies that develop clinical networks and will be of immediate use in shaping strategies and programs to maximize the effectiveness of such networks.",0,0,
508,Development of a managed clinical network in palliative care: a realistic assessment,"BACKGROUND: Achieving evidence-based practice is at the forefront of the international practice development agenda. Therefore, it is imperative that robust evaluation methodologies are in place to explore new approaches to service development. OBJECTIVES: This paper reflects on the merits and challenges of realistic evaluation design in establishing a new managed clinical network (MCN) approach to implement guidance related to the care of people with cancer-related pain. DESIGN AND METHODS: There were three evaluation points that examined three versions of the MCN approach to care. At each stage, steps were taken to identify the context, mechanisms, and outcomes associated with the version of the model under scrutiny. Findings from the patient-centered case studies were incorporated into realistic appraisal interviews with the management group. SETTING: A rural primary care setting in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Three older men, their families, physicians and nurses providing direct care participated, along with 13 members of the network management group. RESULTS: The research highlighted the level of effort required by professionals to introduce the MCN care approach. Progress was much slower than anticipated, sometimes frustrated by inexperience in change management and lack of familiarity with leading practice development projects and practitioner learning support. Issues related to the age-appropriateness of the evidence base in relation to the care of frail older people were also apparent. The professional group that experienced the most role change was district nurses and community pharmacists. CONCLUSION: The collaborative approach fostered by the realist evaluation framework was found particularly useful and there was consensus that evaluation had become an integral part of the intervention itself. There were a number of methodological challenges and the need to limit the depth of 'realistic unraveling'. However, as a formative approach, in the messy world of interdisciplinary practice development, realistic assessment proved to be a valuable design.",0,0,
509,Development of a pain assessment tool for use by nurses in an adult intensive care unit,"Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to pain, with patients citing it as their second biggest stressor in the ICU. Pain has also been identified as a complicating factor in critical illness. Despite this, pain management is often not considered a priority by the ICU team. Effective management can only be achieved with accurate pain assessment. However, this is difficult in critically ill patients, as patients are often unable to communicate verbally due to the presence of endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes, sedation, and paralytic agents. Therefore, nurses rely on behavioral and physiological indicators to establish the presence of pain. However, since these also occur in situations and conditions not associated with pain, there is a need for a systematic and objective assessment tool. Consisting of a numerical and verbal rating scale to facilitate documentation and auditing, the tool was developed as a result of ongoing refinement and evaluation. The tool scores a patient's pain by incorporating physiological and behavioral indicators and is used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Score and the Modified Sheffield Sedation Scale for a comprehensive neurological assessment. Because movement and surgery can exacerbate pain, evaluation is done at rest and during procedures such as suctioning and manual manipulation. As an aid to pain assessment and management, a flowchart and clinical guide have also been introduced. Although preliminary evaluation established the effectiveness of the tool as a means of estimating and recording pain levels in individual patients, it was apparent that there has been no change in the way pain is managed. To address this problem, the level of understanding of the nurses on pain management was verified and teaching sessions were given to increase the profile of pain management in the unit.",0,0,
510,Development of a science of clinical utility in field study strategies of diagnostic classification systems for mental and behavioral disorders according to ICD-11,"The Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse of the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a systematic program of field studies to evaluate and improve the clinical utility of proposed diagnostic guidelines for mental and behavioral disorders in Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11). The clinical utility of a diagnostic classification is critical to its role as the interface between health encounters and health information, and to making ICD-11 a more effective tool to help the 194 WHO member countries, including United States, to reduce the burden of disease of mental disorders. This article describes the efforts of the WHO to develop clinically useful science regarding one of the two main classification systems for mental disorders. We present the rationale and methodologies for an integrated and complementary set of field study strategies, including large international surveys, formative field studies of the structure of clinicians' conceptualization of mental disorders, case-controlled field studies using experimental methodologies to assess the impact of changes in diagnostic guidelines on clinicians' diagnostic decision-making and ecological implementation field studies of clinical utility in the global settings in which the guidelines will ultimately be implemented. The results of these studies have already been used to make decisions about the structure and content of ICD-11. If clinical utility is indeed one of the most important goals of diagnostic systems for mental disorders, as their developers routinely claim, future revision efforts should continue to build on these efforts.

511,Development of an intervention to promote the participation of young people in asthma check-up consultations with practicing nurses,"OBJECTIVE: Article is a report of a study to develop an evidence-based pre-consultation guide for use by young people prior to an asthma review with a nurse practitioner. BACKGROUND: The participation of young people aged 13 to 19 years in consultations with health professionals may be limited by the lack of opportunities to learn the appropriate skills in triadic consultations. Evidence-based interventions have been developed to promote adult participation in consultations, but the needs of young people have not been specifically addressed. DESIGN: Guideline-informed multi-method design for the development of complex interventions. METHODS: A pre-consultation guide for youth was developed in 2007 by applying a health behavior change model, developing criteria by a panel of experts, and in consultation with youth using a nominal group technique. RESULTS: The concepts of the Health Action Process Approach model were applied to the development of the criteria that support the pre-consultation guide. In the nominal groups, the young people agreed that they had different needs from those of other children and adults. The consensus was that pre-consultation guidance should include disease-specific information, realistic photographs rather than Clip Art, consistent font styles, bullets and colors, short words, and mature language. Sample statements and questions written by young people were included in the evidence-based guide. CONCLUSION: The vision of young people can contribute to the development of interventions aimed at promoting communication in consultations with nurses. There is potential for this approach to be used to develop interventions in primary and secondary care for a variety of long-term conditions.",0,0,
512,Develop guidelines for community child health staff and examine referral pathways and outcomes of care in supporting children with emotional and behavioral disorders.,"The East Sussex Public Health Commissioners had asked if referral guidelines were needed to ensure children with the greatest concerns got support from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Community child health doctors and nurses recorded all contacts with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties (EBD) over a one-month period. Data on the presentation of difficulties and on the intervention routes were recorded. The same children were seen five months later and the outcome was measured by clinical assessment and support offered. The work showed that child health staff managed cases both through one-off counseling sessions and through ongoing planned support. In addition, the use of the three-tier pathways recommended by the Department of Health was demonstrated. Analysis of recorded data was used to describe referral pathways and provide guidance on the characteristics of children requiring referral to CAMHS.",0,0,
513,Development of guidelines for smoking cessation interventions for pregnant adolescents,"More than 400,000 deaths a year in the United States are attributed to active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke. The Healthy People 2000 goals call for a reduction in tobacco use by high-risk populations, such as youth and pregnant women. This article describes guidelines for health professionals to address smoking cessation when working with pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers who smoke."";"" PIP: This article examines the essential components of smoking cessation and health promotion interventions for pregnant and parenting adolescents. It also outlines guidelines for health professionals to address smoking cessation when working with pregnant teens and teen parent smokers. Both pregnancy and tobacco use are increasing among teens in the US The evidence clearly indicates that cigarette use among pregnant teens is even higher than the national rate. Such a habit among pregnant adolescents presents an immediate risk to the fetus, in addition to a widespread risk of establishing entrenched patterns of smoking for the adolescent. Quitting smoking during pregnancy can have a profound effect on reducing infant mortality. In this regard, it is suggested that health professionals can have a positive influence on the health of mothers, babies and children by encouraging and supporting smoking cessation efforts in young mothers. The doctor is in a special position to provide this advice during health supervision visits. In general, the guidelines for intervention presented in this article can be used for school clinics with pregnant students and can be easily implemented in private practices or hospital clinics.",0,0,
514,Developing Internet-Based Health Interventions: A Guide for Researchers and Public Health Professionals,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners interested in developing health interventions online often rely on print and web-based resources to guide them through the process of developing online interventions. While helpful in understanding many aspects of best practices for website development, these resources lack concrete examples of experiences developing online interventions for health applications from the perspective of those delivering online health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study is intended to serve as a series of case studies in the development of eHealth interventions to inform researchers and practitioners who are considering technology-based intervention or programmatic approaches. METHODS: A convenience sample of six study coordinators and five principal investigators at a large US-based land-grant university were interviewed about the process of developing online interventions in the areas of alcohol policy, adolescent health, medication adherence, and human immunodeficiency virus prevention. in transgender people and in men who have sex with men. Participants were asked questions that broadly addressed each of the four phases of the User-Centered Design Process Map from the US Department of Health and Human Services Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Qualitative codes were developed using line-by-line open coding for all transcripts, and all transcripts were independently coded by at least 2 authors. Differences between coders were resolved by discussion. RESULTS: We identified the following seven themes: (1) hiring a strong (or at least the right) research team, (2) taking time to plan before beginning the design process, (3) recognizing that vendors and researchers have different values, goals, and language, (4) develop a detailed contract, (5) document all development decisions and activities, (6) use a content management system, and (7) allow additional time for testing and debugging your intervention. Each of these areas is discussed in detail, with supporting quotes from the principal investigators and study coordinators. CONCLUSIONS: The values held by the members of each participating organization involved in the development of the intervention or online program should be considered, as well as the objectives that the website is intended to meet. These defined values and goals should drive an open and explicit discussion about the scope of work, budget, and other needs from the perspectives of each organization. Due to the complexity of developing interventions online, researchers and practitioners need to become familiar with the process and how it may differ from developing and implementing in-person interventions or programs. To help with this, the intervention team should consider expanding the team to include computer science or learning technology experts, as well as tapping into the institutional resources that will be needed to successfully complete the project. Finally, we describe the trade-off between funds available for online intervention or program development and project complexity.",0,0,
515,Developing Leadership Capacity for Guideline Use: A Cluster Randomized Control Pilot Trial,"IMPORTANCE: The importance of leadership in influencing nurses' use of clinical guidelines has been well documented. However, little is known about how to develop and evaluate leadership interventions for guideline use. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test a leadership intervention designed to influence nurses' use of guideline recommendations when caring for patients with diabetic foot ulcers in home nursing. This article reports on the feasibility of implementing the study protocol, trial findings related to nursing process outcomes, and leadership behaviors. METHODS: A mixed-methods pilot study with a post-only cluster randomized controlled trial and descriptive qualitative interviews was conducted. Four units were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups. Clinical and management leadership teams participated in a 12-week leadership intervention (workshop, teleconferences). Participants received summary chart audit data, identified goals for change, and created a team leadership action. Criteria for evaluating the feasibility of the protocol included: design, intervention, measures, and data collection procedures. For the trial, medical record audits compared differences in nursing process outcomes. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Nursing assessment score of 8 items. Secondary outcome: 5-item nursing care score based on change goals identified by intervention participants. Qualitative interviews described leadership behaviors that influenced guideline use. RESULTS: The completion of this pilot showed that some aspects of the study protocol were feasible, while others required further development. The trial findings noted no significant difference in the primary outcome. A significant increase was observed in the score of the 5 items chosen by the intervention participants (p = 0.02). In the experimental group, more relationship-oriented leadership behaviors, auditing, feedback, and reminders were described as leadership strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that a leadership intervention has the potential to influence nurses' use of guideline recommendations, but more work is required to refine the intervention and outcome measures. A taxonomy of leadership behaviors is proposed to inform future research.",0,0,
516,Development of quality measures for the emergency service management of pediatric behaviors related to suicide,"OBJECTIVE: Given the public health importance of suicide-related behaviors and the corresponding gap in the performance measurement literature, we sought to identify key candidate process indicators (measures of quality of care) and structural measures (resources and attributes). organizational) important to the emergency department (ED) management of pediatric behaviors related to suicide. METHODS: We reviewed nationally approved guidelines and published research to establish an inventory of measures. Next, we surveyed pediatric emergency physician experts to assess the level of agreement on the relevance (for patient care) and variability (between hospitals) of 42 candidate process indicators and whether 10 hospital and regional structural measures could affect these. processes. RESULTS: Twenty-three physicians from 14 tertiary care pediatric hospitals responded (93% of hospitals contacted). The candidate process indicators identified as the most relevant to patient care (>/= 87% agree or strongly agree) and the most variable across hospitals (>/= 78% agree or strongly agree) were time waiting time for medical evaluation""; referral to crisis intervention worker/program; mental health, psychosocial, or risk evaluation requested; any inpatient admission; psychiatric inpatient admission; post-discharge treatment plan; waiting time for the first follow-up appointment, follow-up obtained, and type of follow-up obtained Key hospital and regional structural measures (>/=87% agree or strongly agree) were the number of specialized personnel and the type of personnel specialized in or available to the ED; regional policies, protocols, or procedures;"" and inpatient psychiatric services. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted candidate performance measures for managing pediatric suicide-related behaviors in the ED. The 9 candidate process indicators (covering triage, assessment, admission, discharge, and follow-up) and 4 hospital and regional structural measures deserve further development.",0,0,
517,Building Team Leadership to Facilitate Guideline Use: Planning and Evaluating a 3-Month Intervention Strategy,"BACKGROUND: Research describes leadership as important to guideline use. However, interventions to develop current and future leaders for this purpose are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning and evaluation of a leadership intervention to facilitate nurses' use of guideline recommendations for diabetic foot ulcers in home health care. METHOD: Intervention planning involved a synthesis of theory and research (qualitative interviews and chart audits). One workshop and three follow-up teleconferences were delivered at two sites for nurse managers and clinical leaders (n = 15) responsible for 180 staff nurses. The evaluation involved surveys and interviews in workshops. RESULTS: The intervention components best valued (four-point scale) were: identification of objective indicators (mean 3.7) and development of a team leadership action plan (mean 3.5). The pre-workshop barrier assessment scored the lowest (mean 2.9). Three months later, participants indicated that their leadership performance had changed as a result of the intervention, they were more engaged with staff, and they had clear implementation goals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Creating a team leadership action plan to operationalize leadership behaviors can aid in evidence-based care delivery. Access to clinical data and understanding of team knowledge and leadership skills prior to formal training will help nursing management tailor intervention strategies to identify needs and gaps.",0,0,
518,Development of the protocol for the evaluation of the quality commitment initiative of the health foundation: an emerging approach,"In 2004, a UK charity, The Health Foundation, established the 'Committing to Quality Initiative' to explore and assess the benefits of involving doctors in improving the quality of healthcare. Eight projects run by professional bodies or societies specializing in various areas of critical care were commissioned. An initiative development approach was adopted, accompanied by a two-tier evaluation: eight project self-evaluations and a related external evaluation. This article describes how the protocol for external evaluation was developed. Challenges faced included wide variation between and within projects (in focus, scope and context, and in understanding of quality improvement), the need to support project teams in their self-assessments while maintaining objectivity necessary and the difficulty of assessing the moving target created by the development approach adopted in the initiative. An initial period to develop the evaluation protocol proved invaluable in helping us explore these issues.",0,0,
519,Development and Implementation of a Medical Oncology Quality Improvement Tool for a Regional Community Oncology Network: The Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners Initiative,"Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners (FCCCP) is a community hospital/academic partnership consisting of 25 hospitals in the Delaware Valley. Originally created in 1986, the FCCCP promotes quality community cancer care through education, quality assurance, and access to clinical trial research. An important aspect of quality assurance is an annual medical oncology audit that compares quality indicators and guidelines and provides a roadmap for quality improvement initiatives in the community oncology clinical office setting. Each year, the FCCCP team and Associate Medical Oncologists construct disease site- and stage-specific indicators based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. The concordance with multiple indicators is evaluated in 20 graphs of each community practice. A report for each FCCCP medical oncology practice summarizes documentation, screening recommendations, use of new drugs, and research trends at a particular disease site. Descriptive statistics reflect milestones met, number of new cases seen per year, number of disease site cases from tumor registry information, and clinical trial backlog total. Education and documentation tools are provided to physicians and nurses in the oncology practice. The FCCCP's clinical operations team, comprised of medical oncologists and certified oncology nurses, has been conducting quality audits of medical oncology practices for 7 years using NCCN-derived indicators. Successful audits involving gastric, colorectal and breast cancer have been the focus of recent evaluations. For the 2005 Stage II/III Breast Cancer Assessment, median compliance per parameter was 88%, with 15 of 16 practices achieving median compliance greater than 80%. A large-scale quality control audit is feasible in a community network of cancer partners. Recent evaluation of localized breast cancer shows high adherence to guidelines and identifies areas for focused education. The partnership between academic and community oncologists produces a quality review process that is broadly applicable and adaptable to changes in medical knowledge.",0,0,
520,Development and implementation of a program to assess the medical need of patients for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Goal. The development and implementation of a program to assess the medical need of patients for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is described. Resume. Hartford Hospital's Departments of Pharmacy, Medicine, and Information Services collaborated to institute a program to improve VTE prophylaxis in medical patients. After assessing initial adherence to VTE prophylaxis, the departments developed an intervention consisting of a message to be displayed to providers through the institution's computerized prescription order entry (CPOE) system as a reminder to assess the patient looking for risk factors for VTE and the need for VTE prophylaxis. The message was displayed when a patient met predefined criteria for VTE risk factors. The message would no longer be displayed once mechanical or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis was an active order in the patient's medication profile. Extensive education about the program was provided to hospital staff, pharmacists, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses. The program was implemented in March 2007 on a pilot medical floor. To measure the impact of the program, a retrospective chart review was conducted using the developed risk assessment tool. The VTE prophylaxis compliance rate after implementation was 93%, compared to 49% before program implementation (p < 0.001). Before the program, only 25% of patients with a contraindication to drug therapy received mechanical prophylaxis, compared to 100% after program implementation. Conclusion. The use of message alerts through a CPOE system and an interdisciplinary team approach to assess patients' risk of VTE appeared to improve the use of VTE prophylaxis in medical patients.",0,1,
521,Development and implementation of non-pharmacological protocols for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families in a multiracial primary care setting,"PURPOSE: The majority of patients and families with dementia are cared for in primary care clinics. These clinics are rarely designed to provide the comprehensive care needed. The purpose of this article is to describe nonpharmacologic protocols for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families that are administered as part of a multifaceted care management intervention program in a multiracial primary care clinic. DESIGN AND METHODS: The nonpharmacologic component for the integrated collaborative care program was developed based on a review of the literature and prior clinical experience. Care is coordinated by a geriatric nurse who meets with patients, families, and primary care physicians. The non-pharmacological protocols included general educational guidelines on Alzheimer's disease. Specific protocols were also developed to treat the common behavioral disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease. An important component of the intervention is a monthly psychoeducational support group for caregivers. RESULTS: The intervention has been well accepted by patients, families and physicians. About half of the treatment group have regularly participated in the support group. IMPLICATIONS: The integration of behavioral interventions and team care within the primary care setting has been successful.",0,0,

523,Development of a behavior change intervention: a case study on the practical application of the theory,"BACKGROUND: The use of theory in the implementation of complex interventions is highly recommended. A complex trial intervention, to improve self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) in primary care, needed to be implemented in the Management of Osteoarthritis in Practice (MOSAICS) trial. One component of the trial intervention was the delivery by general practitioners (GPs) of an enhanced consultation for patients with OA. The aim of our case study is to describe the systematic selection and use of theory to develop a behavior change intervention to implement enhanced consultation delivery by the GP. METHODS: The development of the behavior change intervention was guided by four theoretical models/frameworks: i) an implementation of the change model to guide the overall approach, ii) The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify the relevant determinants of change, iii) a model for the selection of behavior change techniques to address the identified determinants of behavior change, and iv) principles of adult learning. Methods and measures were identified to assess the impact of the behavior change intervention. RESULTS: The behavior change intervention presented GPs with a ""well-defined change proposition""; addressed seven of the TDF domains (eg, knowledge, skills, motivation, and goals); incorporated ten behavior change techniques (eg, provision of information, skills testing, persuasive communication);"" and it was taught in workshops that valued the experience and professional values of general practitioners. The workshops used a mix of interactive and didactic sessions, were facilitated by opinion leaders and used 'context-linked communication skills training'. The methods and measures selected to assess the behavior change intervention included: assessment of satisfaction with the workshops, GP report of intention to practice, and an assessment of GP videotaped consultations with OA patients. CONCLUSIONS: A stepwise approach to the development of a behavior change intervention, using theoretical frameworks to identify the determinants of change combined with behavior change techniques, has allowed for a systematic and theory-based development of a designed intervention. to improve GP consultations for OA patients. The success of the behavior change intervention in practice will be assessed in the context of the MOSAICS trial as a whole, and will inform understanding of the level of practice and patient outcomes in the trial.",0,0,
524,Development of a complex intervention for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care using the UK Medical Research Council framework,"OBJECTIVE: To apply the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex intervention trials to a primary health care intervention to promote secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. STUDY DESIGN: Case report of intervention development. METHODS: First, the literature related to secondary prevention and lifestyle change was reviewed. Second, a preliminary intervention was modeled, based on findings from the literature and focus group interviews with patients (n = 23) and staff (n = 29) from 4 general practices. Participants' experiences and attitudes toward the key components of the intervention were explored. Third, the preliminary intervention was tested in 4 general practices. After delivery of the pilot intervention, training sessions were evaluated by practitioners, and qualitative data related to intervention experiences were collected through semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 10) and patient focus groups (n = 17). RESULTS: The literature review identified 3 intervention components: a structured recall system, professional training, and patient information. Initial qualitative data identified variations in withdrawal system design, training requirements (medication prescription, behavior change facilitation), and information appropriate to potential study participants. The identification of detailed structures within the components of the intervention clarified how the intervention could be tailored to individual practice, clinician, and patient needs, while preserving the theoretical functions of the components. Findings from the pilot phase informed further modeling of the intervention, reducing administrative time, increasing practical training content, and omitting useless patient information. CONCLUSION: The application of the MRC framework helped determine the feasibility and development of a complex intervention for research in primary care.",0,0,
525,Development of a complex intervention to promote appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in Irish general practice.,"Background Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be viewed as failure to meet recommended targets for the control of key risk factors, including glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control. Poor control of risk factors is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Failure to escalate medications for patients with poor control of T2DM when indicated is called clinical inertia and is a contributing factor to poor control of T2DM. Our aim was to develop a complex theory- and evidence-based intervention to improve appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T2DM in Irish general practice. Methods The first stage of the Medical Research Council Framework was used to develop and evaluate complex interventions. To identify current evidence, we conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled T2DM in community settings. The behavioral change wheel theoretical approach was used to identify appropriate intervention functions. Workshops, simulation, collaborations with academic partners, and clinician shadowing were used to operationalize the intervention functions and design the elements of the complex intervention. Results Our systematic review highlighted that professional interventions, potentially through clinical decision support systems, could address poorly controlled T2DM. Appropriate intensification of antiglycemic and cardiovascular medications, by general practitioners (GPs), for adults with poorly controlled T2DM was identified as the key behavior to address clinical inertia. Psychological capacity was the key driver of behavior that needed to change, suggesting five key intervention functions (education, training, empowerment, environmental restructuring, and incentivization) and nine key behavior change techniques, which were operationalized in a complex intervention. The intervention has three components: (a) a training program/academic detail of targeted GPs, (b) a remote search tool to help GPs identify patients with poor control of T2DM in your practice and (c) web-based clinical decision support. system. Conclusions This article describes a multifaceted process that includes an exploration of current evidence and a deep theoretical understanding of behavioral predictors, resulting in the design of a complex intervention to promote the implementation of evidence-based guidelines, through of appropriate prescription and intensification of medication in poor patients. controlled DMT2.",0,1,
526,Development of a minimization instrument for assigning a hospital-level performance improvement intervention to reduce waiting times in Ontario emergency departments,"Background Rigorous evaluation of an intervention requires that its allocation be unbiased with respect to confounding factors; this is especially difficult in complex and system-wide healthcare interventions. We developed a brief survey instrument to identify factors for a minimization algorithm for hospital assignment. at the intervention level to reduce waiting times in the emergency department (ED) in Ontario, Canada. Methods Potential confounders influencing intervention success were identified by literature review and grouped by healthcare setting-specific stages of change. An international multidisciplinary study (clinical, administrative, decision-maker, managerial) evaluated these factors in a two-stage nominal group and modified Delphi process based on four domains: readiness for change, evidence base, face validity, and clarity of definition. . Results An original set of 33 factors was identified from the literature. The panel narrowed the list to 12 in the first round of polling. In the second survey, the experts scored each factor according to the four domains; Summary scores and consensus discussion resulted in the final selection and measurement of four hospital-level factors to be used in the minimization algorithm: improving patient flow as a hospital leadership priority; physicians' receptivity to organizational change; management efficiency"" and physician incentives that support the goal of change. Conclusion We developed a simple tool designed to collect data from senior hospital managers on factors likely to affect the success of a hospital patient flow improvement intervention. A minimization algorithm will ensure a balanced allocation of the intervention with respect to these factors in the study hospitals.",0,1,
527,Development of a tool to measure clinical competence in occupational therapy: a pilot study?,"Clinical competence is generally defined as a combination of knowledge, skills, and professional behavior. It is typically assessed through written tests, direct observation, chart audits, customer satisfaction surveys, and supervisor ratings. This article describes the development and evaluation of a chart-stimulated recovery (CSR) measure that combines chart audit and clinical interview methods to assess the clinical competence of practicing occupational therapists. The CSR tool was developed using the Canadian Guidelines for Client-Centered Practice and leverages the global domains of competency: use of theory, assessment, program planning, intervention, discharge planning, follow-up, program evaluation, clinical reasoning, and professional conducts. This pilot study involved two independent raters/interviewers who evaluated twelve occupational therapists on two occasions using a random sample of client cases/records on each occasion. The results indicate that the CSR tool is not only reliable and valid, but also generic enough to be used. in a variety of practice settings as a global measure of job performance.",0,0,

529,Development of an ICF-based clinical practice guideline for the assessment of function in head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: Functional outcome after head and neck cancer is not regularly assessed in a standardized way in clinical practice. Clinical trials evaluating functional outcome apply many different instruments. Therefore, the results are not always comparable and have limited clinical implications. The aim of this study was the identification, interdisciplinary evaluation, and recommendation of functional outcome instruments for use in clinical practice and clinical trials in patients with HNC. MATERIAL: The preparatory studies developed a short list of outcome instruments based on previously determined criteria. An interdisciplinary group of experts evaluated these instruments and decided which ones can be recommended for use in 3 application areas: screening, evaluation/planning of therapies, and clinical trials. Healthcare decision-makers included physicians (ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, radiation therapists, oncologists), medical psychologists, speech and language therapists, physical therapists, and social workers. RESULTS: 98 instruments were presented at the consensus conference. In total, 21 participants recommended for each of the 3 application areas a basic set of measures for the assessment of impairment in 6 functional domains: monitoring of follow-up therapy, pain, ingestion, voice/speech, other organic problems and problems. psychosocial. CONCLUSION: A multiprofessional expert group discussed and adopted recommendations for the use of functional outcome instruments in clinical practice and/or research. The recommended instruments are now available for use in clinical routine.",0,0,
530,Development of clinical practice guidelines for the nursing care of people undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions: an Australian and New Zealand collaboration,"OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development of nursing practice guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) supporting PCI nursing care are limited. METHOD: The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) development guidelines for medical and health practices were used for the guideline development process. A panel of experts (physicians and consumers) attended a consensus conference to review the existing evidence. Subsequently, the opinions of the nurses were identified through an online survey. This was followed by a modified Delphi method that was used to refine a draft guideline in two rounds. RESULTS: The consensus conference was attended by 41 participants (39 cardiovascular nurses and 2 consumer representatives). Eight additional members joined the panel for modified Delphi rounds with 27 participants completing the survey online. The final guideline document consisted of 75 recommendations. Endorsement was then sought from the leading cardiovascular bodies in Australia and New Zealand. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Inconclusive evidence precludes definitive recommendations. Therefore, consultation and consensus are important in developing guidelines for standardized nursing care and outcome monitoring. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a crucial role in IPC care, however there are currently limited guidelines to inform practice. This document describes the method of clinical practice guideline development and consensus building.",0,0,
531,Developing geriatric competencies for emergency medicine residents through an expert consensus process,"BACKGROUND: The rate of emergency department (ED) visits for older patients exceeds that for all age groups except infants. The aging of the population will increase the use of older patients in the emergency department from 35% to 60% of all visits. Older patients can have complex clinical presentations and be resource intensive. Evidence indicates that emergency physicians do not provide consistent high-quality care to older patients with emergencies, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to develop a consensus document, ""Geriatric Competencies for Emergency Medicine Residents,"" by identified experts. This is a minimum set of behavior-based performance standards that all residents should be able to demonstrate upon completion of their residency training. METHODS: This consensus-based process used an inductive, qualitative, multiphase approach to determine the minimum geriatric competencies needed by emergency medicine (EM) residents. Face validity and reliability assessments were used throughout the project. RESULTS: In Phase I, participants (n=363) identified 12 domains and 300 potential competencies. In Phase II, a panel of experts (n=24) pooled the responses from Phase I, resulting in eight domains and 72 competencies. In Phase III, the expert panel narrowed the competencies down to 26. In Phase IV, face validity and reliability analysis yielded 100% consensus for eight domains and 26 competencies. Domains identified were ""atypical disease presentation""; trauma, including falls; cognitive and behavioral disorders; emergent intervention modifications; medication management; care transitions; pain management and palliative care""; and the effect of comorbid conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The Geriatric Competencies for MS Residents is a consensus document that can form the basis for MS residency curricula and assessment to meet the demands of our aging population.",0,0,
532,"Development, implementation and evaluation of an asthma care model based on a community pharmacy","BACKGROUND Pharmacists are in a unique position in the health care system to address critical issues in the management of asthma in the community. Several programs have demonstrated the benefits of a pharmacist-led asthma care program; however, none of these programs have been previously evaluated in Australia. OBJECTIVE To measure the impact of a specialized asthma service provided through community pharmacies in terms of clinical, humanistic and clinical objectives for the patient. METHODS A parallel controlled design was used, in which 52 intervention patients and 50 control patients with asthma were recruited at 2 different sites. In the intervention area, pharmacists were trained and an asthma care model was delivered, with 3 follow-ups. visits over 6 months. This model was evaluated based on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes compared between and within groups. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in asthma severity in the intervention group, 2.6 ± 0.5 to 1.6 ± 0.7 (mean ± SD;"" p < 0.001) versus the control group, 2.3 ± 0.7 to 2.4 ± 0.5. In the intervention group, peak flow rates improved from 82.7% ± 8.2% at baseline to 87.4% ± 8.9% (p < 0.001) at the final visit, and there was a significant reduction in the defined daily dose of albuterol used by patients, from 374.8 ± 314.8 µg at baseline to 198.4 ± 196.9 µg at final visit (p < 0.015) There was also a statistically significant improvement in perceived asthma control and asthma-related knowledge scores in the intervention group compared to the control group between baseline and final visit Annual savings of $132.84 (AU) in medication costs were demonstrated $100,801.20 per patient and $100,801.20 for the entire group, based on overall reduction in severity. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, it appears that a specialized model of asthma care offers community pharmacists the opportunity to contribute to improving asthma control in the Australian community.",0,1,
533,Diabetes in rural towns: effectiveness of continuing education and feedback for health care providers in altering diabetes outcomes at the population level: protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases internationally. Health complications associated with type 2 diabetes can be prevented, delayed, or improved through early diagnosis and effective management. This research aims to examine the impact of a primarily web-based educational intervention on diabetes care provided by general practitioners (GPs) in rural areas and subsequent patient outcomes. A population-level approach is used for outcome assessment, through anonymized city-wide pathology registries. METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a cluster randomized controlled trial with rural communities as the unit of analysis. Towns from four Australian states were selected and matched based on factors including rurality, population size, proportion of the population that were Indigenous Australians, and socio-economic status. Eleven pairs of villages from two states were suitable for the trial, and one village from each pair was randomly assigned to the experimental group. Physicians in cities assigned to the experimental group are offered an intervention package that includes education on best practice in diabetes care through an online active learning module, a moderated discussion forum, access to counseling targeted and specialized through an online application form and city performance feedback on diabetes management and outcomes. The package is offered through repeated direct mail. DISCUSSION: The benefits of the trial results are described along with the challenges and limitations associated with the methodology.

535,Diabetes Nurse Case Management and Motivational Interviewing for Change (DYNAMICS): Study Design and Baseline Characteristics in the Chronic Care Model for Type 2 Diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that diabetes is costly and devastating, the health care system is ill-equipped to meet the challenges of chronic disease care. The Penn State Diabetes and Obesity Institute is evaluating a management model for type 2 DM that includes nurse case management (NCM) and motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage behavior change. The primary care intervention is designed to improve patient self-management and reduce clinical inertia through providers' use of standardized clinical guidelines to achieve better outcomes in diabetes. METHODS: This RCT tests the efficacy of an enhanced NCM intervention on outcomes for patients with type 2 DM (n = 549) mediated by changes in self-care behavior and diabetes control. Outcome measures include: (a) effect on clinical parameters such as HbA1c (<7), BP (<130/80) and LDL (<100), weight and depression scores""; (b) process measures such as detection of complications; (c) psychological and behavioral patient outcomes measured by emotional distress (PAID), diabetes-specific quality of life (ADDQoL), patient satisfaction (DTSQ), self-care activities (SDSCA), and (d) physician satisfaction and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline includes age (mean) = 58; BMI = 34.4; 57% women;"" 47% Caucasian and 39% Hispanic. The patients had elevated HbA1c (8.4), BP (137/77) and LDL (114). In general, the patients were depressed (CES-D=21.6) and had extremely poor quality of life (ADDQoL=-1.58). We believe that improved NCM will improve self-care and reduce emotional distress for patients with diabetes. If proven effective, improved NCM may translate to other chronic diseases.",0,0,

We review progress in diabetes translation research and identify future challenges and opportunities in this field. Several promising interventions are available to optimize the implementation of effective diabetes treatments. Many of these interventions, alone or in combination, need to be tested more formally in larger randomized or quasi-experimental clinical trials using outcomes of particular interest to patients (for example, patient satisfaction and quality of life) and policymakers (for example). example, cost). and profitability). The long-term outcomes (such as morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and costs) of strategies aimed at improving diabetes care need to be evaluated. Translation research also needs to incorporate ways of studying complex systems of care. The challenges and opportunities offered by translation research are tremendous.",0,0,
537,Diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"PURPOSE: The purpose of this NIH Consensus Statement is to inform the biomedical research and clinical practice communities about the results of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ). The statement provides cutting-edge information on effective treatments for ADHD and presents the consensus panel's conclusions and recommendations regarding these topics. In addition, the statement identifies those areas of study that deserve further investigation. At the end of this educational activity, the reader should have a clear practical clinical knowledge of the state of the art regarding this topic. The target audience of physicians for this statement includes, but is not limited to, psychiatrists, family physicians, pediatricians, internists, neurologists, psychologists, and behavioral medicine specialists. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were a 13-member, non-federal, non-advocacy panel representing the fields of psychology, psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, epidemiology, biostatistics, education, and the public. In addition, 31 experts from these same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 1215. EVIDENCE: The literature was searched through Medline and an extensive bibliography of references was provided to the panel and conference audience. The experts prepared summaries with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given priority over anecdotal clinical experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The panel, answering predefined questions, developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence presented in the open forum and the scientific literature. The panel drafted a statement that was read in its entirety and distributed to experts and the public for comment. The panel subsequently resolved the conflicting recommendations and issued a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the reviews a few weeks after the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its release at the conference and was updated with the final revisions of the panel. CONCLUSIONS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD is a commonly diagnosed childhood behavior disorder that represents a significant and costly public health problem. Children with ADHD have pronounced deficits and can experience long-term adverse effects on academic performance, vocational success, and social-emotional development that have a profound impact on individuals, families, schools, and society. Despite advances in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD, this disorder and its treatment remain controversial, especially the use of psychostimulants for short- and long-term treatment. Although there is no independent diagnostic test for ADHD, there is evidence to support the validity of the disorder. More research is needed on the dimensional aspects of ADHD, as well as comorbid (co-existing) conditions present in both childhood and adulthood. Studies (mainly short-term, approximately three months) including randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of stimulants and psychosocial treatments in alleviating ADHD symptoms and associated aggressiveness and have indicated that stimulants are more effective than therapies psychosocial to treat these symptoms. Due to the lack of consistent improvement beyond core symptoms and the paucity of long-term studies (greater than 14 months), there is a need for longer-term studies with drugs and behavioral modalities and their combination. Although trials are underway, no conclusive recommendations on long-term treatment can currently be made. There are wide variations in the use of psychostimulants between communities and clinicians, suggesting that there is no consensus on which patients with ADHD should be treated with psychostimulants.

Study selection: The authors screened abstracts and selected articles for review based on a pooled judgment. Data on clinical examination were mainly based on recent systematic reviews; data on imaging tests were mainly based on original articles. Data extraction: one or the other author extracted the results of the diagnosis. The quality of the methods was assessed informally. identified, but quantitative data extraction and scoring were not performed. Data synthesis: Formal meta-analysis was not used because diagnostic hardware and software, gold standards, and patient selection methods were heterogeneous and the number of studies was small. higher for magnetic resonance imaging (0.83 to 0.93) and radionuclide scanning (0.74 to 0.98);"" specificity was higher for magnetic resonance imaging (0.9 to 0.97) and radiography (0.95 to 0.99) MRI was the most sensitive (0.96) and specific (0.92) test for infection The sensitivity and specificity of MRI for herniated discs were slightly superior to those of computed tomography, but very similar for the diagnosis of spinal stenosis For adults younger than 50 years of age without signs or symptoms of systemic disease, symptomatic therapy without imaging is appropriate For patients aged 50 years or older or more or those whose findings suggest systemic disease, plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic disease.Advanced imaging should be reserved for patients who are considering surgery or those who are n those with a strong suspicion of systemic disease.",0,0,
540,Dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia: do dietitians do it better? A randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Current National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines recommend initial dietary advice by physicians for most patients with hypercholesterolemia"";"" Referral to a registered dietitian and lipid-lowering medications are recommended only for patients who remain hypercholesterolemic. The incremental value of detailed nutritional advice from dieticians when added to general nutritional advice provided by physicians was assessed. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Hypercholesterolemic patients detected during a cholesterol screening project were randomly assigned to receive dietary advice by a physician alone (70 patients) or by a physician and a registered dietitian (66 patients). Patients were followed for 1 year to determine compliance with NCEP guidelines. RESULTS: At 3 months, the mean (+/- SD) decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 7% +/- 11% in the medical group and 12% +/- - 10% in the dietician group (P<0.004). A decrease of 10% or more in LDL cholesterol level was observed in 25 patients (36%) in the medical group and 43 patients (65%) in the diet group (P < 0.001). Only 40 (29%) of patients in both groups achieved NCEP goals at 3 months. Most of them were low-risk patients with a target LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dl. At 12 months, both groups lost about half of the beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol levels, and the difference between the two groups diminished. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved after counseling by dieticians is superior to that achieved by physicians. However, long-term compliance remains inadequate. For high-risk patients, a more aggressive dietary approach and possibly earlier introduction of lipid-lowering medications should be considered.",0,0,

542,Differentiating normal speech dysfluency from stuttering in children,"The concept of stuttering refers to the lack of fluency or hesitation of a speech pattern. The incidence is reported to be 1% worldwide, with a higher incidence of men than women (3:1). Theories of causation are briefly identified, including a genetic predisposition and neurological factors. In the process of acquiring speech skills, preschool children typically go through a transitional stage of speech influency. This fact can prevent the recognition of early stuttering, can be emotionally painful for the child and can interfere with psychological development. The health care provider is in a key position to provide early diagnosis and intervention for the child with early stuttering. To do so, the health care provider must have the knowledge and skill to differentiate between normal developmental fluency and early stuttering. Factors that differentiate these speech patterns are identified along with guidelines for referral. Current treatment modalities employed by speech pathologists are described. Practical interventions to offer parents to promote fluency in the child's speech and decrease speaker anxiety are summarized.",0,0,
543,Difficulties in implementing a mental health guideline: an exploratory investigation using psychological theory,"BACKGROUND: Evaluations of interventions to improve guideline implementation have failed to produce a clear pattern of results in favor of any particular method. While implementation depends on clinicians and managers changing a variety of behaviors, psychological theories of behavior and behavior change are rarely used to try to understand difficulties in implementation or to develop interventions to overcome them. OBJECTIVES: This study applied psychological theory to examine explanations for implementation difficulties. It used a theoretical framework derived from an interdisciplinary consensus exercise to code interviews into 11 theoretical domains. The focus of the study was the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence schizophrenia guideline recommendation that family intervention should be offered to families of people with schizophrenia. METHODS: Participants were recruited from community mental health teams from three UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts; 20 members participated (social workers, nurses, team managers, psychologists and psychiatrists). The semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and the interview questions were based on the theoretical domains and addressed the respondents' knowledge, attitudes, and opinions regarding the guideline. Two researchers independently coded the segments of each interview transcript that were related to each theoretical domain. A score of 1 indicated that domain-related transcript segments did not appear to contain a description of difficulties in implementing family therapy guidelines; similarly, a score of 0.5 indicated possible difficulties and a score of . of 0 indicated definite difficulties.RESULTS: Coding of respondents' responses to questions related to the three domains 'beliefs about consequences', 'social/professional role and identity', and 'motivation' yielded the three highest total scores , indicating that factors related to these domains are unlikely to constitute difficulties in implementation.""Context and environmental resources"" was the domain with the lowest score, and ""Emotion"" had the second lowest score, suggesting that these are likely to be areas to consider intervention The top two resources identified as problems were the time and training. The emotions that seemed to potentially influence the offer of family therapy were doubt and fear. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study demonstrates an approach to developing a theoretical understanding of implementation difficulties.",0,0,

Objective To determine whether risk factors, such as demographics, trauma, health status, and psychiatric illness, are associated with disability in Bosnian refugees. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey conducted in 1996 among Bosnian refugee adults living in a camp established by the Croatian government near the town of Vara?din. One adult age 18 or older was randomly selected from each of the 573 families in the camp; 534 (93%) agreed to participate (mean age, 50 years; 41% men). Main outcome measures Culturally validated measures for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) included the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, respectively Disability measures included the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 20, a scale of functioning based on World Health Organization criteria and self-reports of socioeconomic activity, physical energy levels, and perceived health status. Results Respondents reported a mean (SD) of 6.5 (4.7) unduplicated traumatic events; 18% (n=95) had experienced 1 or more events of torture. While 55.2% reported no psychiatric symptoms, 39.2% and 26.3% reported symptoms that meet dsm-iv criteria for depression and ptsd, respectively, 20.6% reported comorbid symptoms for both disorders, a total of 25.5% reported having a disability. comorbid symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with increased risk of disability compared with asymptomatic refugees (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.02; 95% confidence interval ¦Ã–, 3.05 -8.26; adjusted o, 2.06;"" 95% CI, 1.10-3.86).

547,Discern patterns of human immunodeficiency virus risk in healthy young adults,"Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of existing methods for identifying people at high risk of contracting and transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk reduction strategies. We review our research on young adult sexual decision-making using theories and methods from the social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest the value of targeting intervention strategies at individuals with different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk of infection than they realise. Primary care physicians are the first line of contact for many people in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen people at risk. Given the time demands and other barriers, easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for use by primary care physicians to identify an individual's risk, from which personalized intervention strategies can be developed.",0,0,

549,Cholinesterase inhibitor discontinuation: results from a survey of Canadian dementia experts.,"BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are being used for increasingly longer periods of time, including in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. Because there is little data to help clinicians decide when it is safe and appropriate to stop ICEs after long-term use, practices can vary widely. METHODS: An Internet-based survey of Canadian dementia experts (geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians) involved in clinical trial research was conducted. Recommendations for ChEI discontinuation were determined based on responses to questions related to patient/caregiver preference, administrative considerations, efficacy, and adverse events. RESULTS: There was reasonable consensus that ICEs should be discontinued based on patient and caregiver preferences, and in the presence of bothersome and serious adverse events. There was much less consensus on issues related to efficacy, in particular, constituting a larger than expected decline. There was a general reluctance to rely on a single measure of cognition, function, and/or behavior and, in particular, the MMSE was not considered useful for making decisions about discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Recommendations to discontinue ICEs after long-term use are presented from a survey of dementia experts. Ideally, clinical practice guidelines based on controlled discontinuation trials are needed.",0,0,

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the intervention, participants were videotaped discussing a trial with an actor portraying a patient. These consultations were evaluated for the presence of information required by the good clinical practice guidelines. The patient actors gave an evaluation after each interview. Participants reported their self-confidence about key aspects of the essay discussion. RESULTS: Analysis of videotaped consultations showed that, after the intervention, significantly more participants displayed key communication behaviors, such as explaining randomization (69 vs. 81, odds ratio 2.33, P = 0.033), checking understanding of patients (11 vs. 31, odds ratio 3.22). , P = 0.002) and discussing standard treatment (73 versus 88, odds ratio 4.75, P = 0.005) and side effects (69 versus 85, odds ratio 3.29, P = 0.006). Participants' self-confidence increased significantly (P < 0.001) in all areas. Patient actor ratings of participant communication showed significant improvements in 12/15 key items. CONCLUSION: This intensive 8-hour intervention significantly improved participants' confidence and competence in communicating about randomized clinical trials.",0,0,
551,Discussion of risky sexual behavior in HIV care is rare and appears ineffective: a mixed methods study,"Consensus guidelines in HIV care require clinicians to provide a brief sexual risk behavior intervention at each visit. Studies based on participant reports find that this occurs infrequently, but studies based on direct observation of clinical encounters are lacking. We conducted a mixed-method study using audio recordings of 116 routine outpatient visits of 58 different HIV-positive patients, at five different practice sites. Visit transcripts were coded and analyzed using a quantitative system. In addition, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the dialogue segments in which risky sexual behaviors emerged as a topic. The discussion of risky sexual behavior occurred over 10 visits and was generally quite brief. Two visits included substantial sexual risk reduction counseling"";"" two others included substantial discussion that was clearly not directed at the patient's changing behavior. Signs suggesting a need or opportunity for such discussion that physicians did not follow up occurred at an additional seven visits. Interactions about sexual risk had less patient involvement than interactions about other health behaviors. Physicians rarely provide advice on sexual risk reduction in HIV care, even when there are specific indications.",0,0,

Practice-relevant research information is delivered to providers through publication of randomized clinical trial results, dissemination of consensus recommendations, development and use of computerized clinical decision aids, and provision of education continuing medical. Each of these areas offers numerous examples of the extremely modest behavioral response that can be expected from the mere provision of information. The literature also offers some principles that can improve the chances of success, including the desirability of techniques that involve face-to-face interaction, promoting the active participation of the student, repeating the message, making explicit and relevant recommendations for clinical practice, and making use of of opinion leaders and peer influence. Little basic research has been done on provider motivations and actual decision-making processes.

555,Do decision support systems influence prescription variation?,"BACKGROUND: Translating scientific evidence into daily practice is problematic. All kinds of intervention strategies have evolved, using educational and/or directive strategies, aimed at modifying behavior, but they have been found to be only partially successful. In this article, the focus is on (computerized) decision support systems (DSS). DSSs intervene in the daily routine of clinicians, as opposed to interventions that aim to influence knowledge to change behavior. We examine whether general practitioners (GPs) prescribe according to the advice provided by the DSS and whether there is less variation in prescribing when using the DSS. METHODS: Data from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP2), collected in 2001, were used. A total of 82 diagnoses, 749,811 contacts, 133 physicians, and 85 practices were included in the analyses. GPs who used the DSS daily were compared with those who did not. Multilevel analyzes were used to analyze the data. Two outcome measures were chosen: whether or not the prescription was in accordance with DSS advice, and a concentration measure, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). RESULTS: Physicians who use the DSS daily prescribe more according to the advice given in the DSS than physicians who do not use the DSS. Contrary to our expectations, there were no significant differences between the HHIs for both groups: the variation in prescription was comparable. CONCLUSION: We studied the use of a DSS for drug prescription in general practice in the Netherlands. The DSS is based on guidelines developed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners and implemented in the Electronic Medical Systems of GPs. GPs using the DSS prescribe more often according to the advice provided in the DSS compared to GPs not using the DSS. This finding, however, does not mean that the variation is less"";"" the variation is the same for GPs using and GPs not using a DSS. The implications of the study are that DSSs can be used to implement guidelines, but variation should not be expected to be limited.",0,1,
556,Do health reforms impact the cost consciousness of health professionals? Results of a national survey in the Balkans,"BACKGROUND: Serbia, as the largest market in the Western Balkans, has entered a socio-economic transition with considerable delay compared to most of Eastern Europe. His health care reform efforts have been bold over the past 15 years, but their results have been inconsistent in several areas. The two waves of global recession that hit the Balkan economies were finally reflected in the financial situation of health care. Serious difficulties in providing accessible health care to citizens became a reality. A large part of the excruciating expense actually pertains to over-the-counter prescription pharmaceuticals and various physician-ordered laboratory and imaging procedures. Therefore, a broad national survey was conducted at all levels of the health system hierarchy to discern the ability of cost-containment strategies to reshape physician mindsets and decision-making in practice. OBJECTIVES: To assess health professionals' judgment of the economic consequences of prescribed medical interventions and to assess the responsiveness of health professionals to policy measures aimed at increasing cost awareness. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted through a hierarchy of medical facilities in various geographic regions before and after the political action, from January 2010 to April 2013. In the middle of the observed period, the National Health Insurance Fund Health (RFZO) adopted severe cost containment measures. Independently, pharmacoeconomic guidelines aimed at prescribers were disseminated. The administration of large hospitals and community pharmacies was forced to restrict access to health care with a high budget impact. The Health Professionals Economic Awareness Questionnaire-29 (EAHPQ-29), developed in the Serbian language, was used in face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire documented physicians' attitudes on: Clinical Decision Making Between Alternative Interventions (CDMAI), Quality of Health Care (QHC), and Cost Containment Policy (CCP). The authors randomly and anonymously recruited 2000 health care experts, with a total of 1487 responses; after removing incomplete surveys, 649 participants were considered before and 651 after the policy intervention. RESULTS: Dentists (1.195 +/- 0.560) had a higher mean CDMAI score compared to physicians (1.017 +/- 0.453). The surgical group compared to the internist group had a higher EAHPQ-29 total score, CCP score, and CDMAI score. The policy intervention had a statistically significant negative impact on the QHC score (F = 4.958; df=1; ""p=0.027). There was no substantial impact of the policy interventions on behavior and professional judgment regarding CDMAI, CCP, and EAHPQ-29 total scores.CONCLUSION: Although cost savings were forceful in practice, the effects on clinical decision making were modest.Physicians' perceptions of quality of care explained less effectively due to severely limited resources allocated to providers.This pioneering effort in the Balkans exposes the ineffectiveness of current policies in expanding physicians' cost consciousness.",0,0,

An intervention to improve the implementation of the guidelines is the knowledge transfer program built around the activities of a knowledge broker (KB). This study investigates the use of KB to implement guideline recommendations for intensive therapy and physical activity for patients after stroke in 22 strokes. units in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. METHODS/DESIGN: This study includes a quantitative evaluation with an uncontrolled pre-post intervention design and a mixed methods process evaluation. From each stroke unit, enterprising nurses and therapists will be recruited and trained as KB. The KB will work for a year on the implementation of the recommendations of the guide in his team. To assess the effectiveness of KB, a questionnaire will be administered to patients, health professionals, and KB at baseline (T0) and after one year (T1). In addition, semi-structured interviews will be carried out with 5 KB in T1. The primary outcome of this implementation project will be support from health professionals for patients to exercise and be physically active, as reported by patients and health professionals themselves. The support immediately after the intervention is compared with the support at the beginning of the intervention. In addition, we will explore the influence of the sociodemographic characteristics of health professionals and the determinants identified in the Theory of Planned Behavior (intention, attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavior). behavioral control) on behavior change support from health professionals. Finally, the KBs will complete a questionnaire about their own psychological and sociodemographic characteristics and about the organizational conditions necessary for the improvement of medical care, such as time, workforce, sponsorship, and management support. DISCUSSION: With this study we will get an idea of when and why knowledge brokers seem to be effective. We will also identify determinants that predict which health professionals are likely to change their behavior. This study will provide guidance on how to implement the guidelines and help improve stroke rehabilitation services.",0,0,
558,Do nurses have a different physical health profile? A systematic review of experimental and observational studies on the physical health of nurses,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence on the health of nurses. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the most important resources in a health system. They are subject to biological, socioeconomic, cultural and health system factors that determine their health. Although mental and physical health problems seem to be prevalent among nurses, the literature is often contradictory. The literature on health styles, health behaviors and perceived health by nurses is also unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review of experimental and observational studies on nurses' health. METHODS: Forty-three databases searched. 2692 references identified as of potential interest"";"" 187 studies included. Only the results of studies on physical health are presented. A meta-analysis was not possible. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system was used to rate the evidence. RESULTS: Nurses had a higher risk of musculoskeletal injuries and were more prone to bloodborne pathogen infections than other health care workers. They had a higher risk of breast cancer than other health workers. Nurses in hospitals were at higher risk of tuberculosis. They had no excess risk of cancer overall, Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, ovary, kidney, brain, or thyroid, or lymphosarcoma. They have a higher prevalence of occupational allergies than white-collar workers. DISCUSSION: Nurses suffer more from musculoskeletal disorders, which is consistent with the nature of nursing work. They are at increased risk of contracting tuberculosis, especially if they work in pulmonary, medical, or human immunodeficiency virus wards, which may be due to repeated contact with infected patients. Nurses are also more prone to bloodborne pathogen infections, which could be explained by exposure while on the job. The propensity for occupational allergies can be explained by exposure to a series of chemical agents. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Without a solid understanding of nurses' health, it is not possible to develop specific occupational health programs.",0,0,
559,Do pediatricians apply the NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN 2009 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux after being trained?,"BACKGROUND: According to a recent survey, European primary care pediatricians do not meet the 2009 North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition guidelines for gastroesophageal reflux and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition. The main issue that emerged from the survey was the prescription of unnecessary acid-suppressing medications, especially in infants. The reasons were not investigated. The main objective of the present study was to assess the applicability of the guidelines in European primary care paediatricians receiving specific training. METHODS: One hundred pediatricians involved in the above survey agreed to participate and were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group was trained on the guidelines through an online podcast and the other group was trained through a synopsis. For the next 3 months, each pediatrician involved was asked to enroll all consecutive infants, children, or adolescents with symptoms suggestive of reflux. For each patient enrolled, pediatricians completed a report on their diagnostic and therapeutic options. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients (boys/girls 186/196, infants/boys/adolescents 194/123/65) were recruited by pediatricians. Infants with unexplained crying and/or distressed behavior prescribed PPIs were 3.7% compared to 45.2% in pretraining survey data (P < 0 .05). Infants with uncomplicated recurrent vomiting and regurgitation who were prescribed proton pump inhibitors were 4.5% vs. 37.1% in baseline survey data (p < 0.05). The overall rate of children managed in full adherence to guidelines was 46.1% after training compared to 1.8% before training (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between pediatricians in the podcast and synopsis groups. CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines on gastroesophageal reflux of the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition-European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition have good applicability, despite the fact that European primary care pediatricians do not currently comply with them. Simple and inexpensive trainings have been shown to be effective in increasing adherence by pediatricians. Increased compliance clearly favors the role of continuing medical education through simple educational tools and subsequent practice evaluation.",0,1,
560,Do polypills lead to neglect of lifestyle risk factors? Findings from a meta-analysis of individual participant data among 3140 patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether polypill-based care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is associated with a change in lifestyle risk factors compared with usual care, among patients with CVD or calculated high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis of three trials involving patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand that compared a strategy using a polypill containing aspirin, a statin, and antihypertensive therapy with regular care. common in patients with a prior CVD event or who were at high risk for their first event. Analyzes investigated any differential effects on self-reported anthropometric measures and lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: Among 3,140 patients (75% men, mean age 62 years, and 76% with a prior CVD event) there was no difference in lifestyle risk factors in those randomized to polypill-based care compared to polypill-based care. usual care for a median of 15 months. either among all participants combined or in a variety of subgroups. Furthermore, the narrow confidence intervals (CIs) excluded any important effect"";"" for example, the differences between groups in body mass index was -0.1 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.1) kg/m(2), in weekly duration of physical activity moderate intensity was -2 (-26 to 23) minutes and the proportion of smokers was 16% vs 17% (RR 0.98, 0.84 to 1.15) at the end of the trial. DISCUSSION: This review allays concerns that polypill-based care may lead to neglect of lifestyle risk factors, at least among high-risk patients. The most effective preventive approaches should address lifestyle factors in conjunction with pharmaceutical interventions, as recommended by leading international guidelines.",0,0,
561,Documentation-based clinical decision support to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background and objective Clinical guidelines discourage the prescription of antibiotics for many acute respiratory infections (ARIs), especially for appropriate non-antibiotic diagnoses. Clinical decision support based on electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to improve antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. Methods We randomly assigned 27 primary care clinics to receive either a documentation-based clinical decision support system integrated with EHR for the care of patients with AKI, the ARI Smart Formulary, or to provide usual care. The primary outcome was the rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs in an intention-to-intervention analysis based on administrative diagnoses. Results During the intervention period, patients made 21,961 ARI visits to study clinics. Intervention clinicians used the ARI Smart form in 6% of 11,954 ARI visits. The antibiotic prescription rate at intervention clinics was 39% vs. 43% at control clinics (odds ratio [OR], 0.8""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6_1, 2, adjusted for clinic grouping.) appropriate AKI diagnoses, the antibiotic prescription rate was 54% at intervention clinics and 59% at control clinics (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5_1.3).% in intervention clinics and 34% in control clinics (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6_1.4).When the ARI Smart form was used, according to the diagnoses entered on the form, the antibiotic prescription rate was 49% overall, 88% for appropriate diagnoses with antibiotics and 27% for inappropriate diagnoses with antibiotics In a usage analysis, the ARI Smart Form was associated with a lower rate of prescription of antibiotics for acute bronchitis (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3_0.8).The smart form for ARI did not reduce overall antibiotic prescribing or significantly improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, but it was not widely used. When used, the ARI Smart Form can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to administrative diagnoses and can reduce antibiotic prescribing for certain diagnoses.",0,1,
562,Does the joint development and dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines improve prescribing behavior: a pre/post study with a concurrent control group and a randomized trial?,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to maintain control over prescribing behavior in general practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a multidisciplinary guideline dissemination strategy on medication prescription volume. METHODS: The study included two designs, a pre/post quasi-experimental study with a concurrent control group and a random sample of physicians within the intervention group. The intervention area with 53 GPs was compared with a control group of 54 randomly selected GPs in the south and center of the Netherlands. In addition, randomization was run in the intervention group to create two arms with 27 GPs who were more heavily involved in guideline development and 26 GPs in the control group. A multidisciplinary committee developed prescription guidelines. Subsequently, these guidelines were disseminated to all physicians in the intervention region. Additional effects were studied in the subgroup trial in which GPs were invited to participate more fully in the guideline development process. The guidelines contained 14 recommendations on antibiotics, asthma/COPD medications, and cholesterol medications. The main outcome measures were prescription data over a three-year period (one year before and two years after guideline release) and the rate of change according to recommendations. RESULTS: Significant short-term improvements were seen for one recommendation: mupirocin. Long-term changes were found for cholesterol drug prescriptions. No additional changes were seen for the randomized controlled study in the subgroup. GPs did not accept the invitation to participate. CONCLUSION: The dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines that were developed within a region does not have a clear effect on prescribing behavior despite the fact that general practitioners and specialists participated more intensely in their development. Apparently more effort is needed to bring about change.",0,0,563.0

564,Does methadone maintenance treatment based on new national guidelines work in a primary care setting?,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are encouraged to treat more drug users, but there are few studies demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients retained on methadone maintenance treatment for one year in a modern British primary care setting, with prescribing protocols based on new national guidelines, can achieve harm reduction outcomes similar to those demonstrated in other settings. , using objective outcome measures where available. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: The Primary Care Clinic for Drug Dependence, Sheffield. METHOD: The intervention consisted of methadone maintenance treatment provided by GPs with prescribing protocols based on 1999 national guidelines. The first 96 eligible patients who consented to enter treatment were recruited"";"" 65 completed the study. Outcome measures were current drug use, HIV risk behaviour, social functioning, criminal activity, and mental and physical health, supplemented by urinalysis and criminal history data. RESULTS: Frequency of heroin use was reduced from a mean of 3.02 episodes per day (standard deviation [SD] = 1.73) to a mean of 0.22 episodes per day (SD = 0.54), ( chi 2 = 79.48, degrees of freedom [df ] = 2, P < 0.001), confirmed by urinalysis. The mean number of convictions and warnings was reduced by 62% (z = 3.378, P < 0.001) for all crimes. HIV risk-taking behavior, social functioning, and physical and psychological well-being showed significant improvements. CONCLUSION: Patients retained on methadone maintenance treatment for one year in a primary care setting may achieve improvements in a range of harm reduction outcomes similar to those shown by studies in other, often more structured, programs.",0,0,
565,Does publication bias inflate the apparent efficacy of psychological treatment for major depressive disorder? A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials funded by the US National Institutes of Health.,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antidepressant medication has been shown empirically to be overestimated due to publication bias, but this has only been inferred statistically with respect to psychological treatment for depression. We directly assessed the extent of study publication bias in trials examining the efficacy of psychological treatment for depression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We identified US National Institutes of Health grants awarded to fund randomized clinical trials comparing psychological treatment with control conditions or other treatments in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder during the period 1972-2008, and we determine whether those grants led to publications. . For studies that were not published, data were requested from the investigators and included in the meta-analyses. Thirteen (23.6%) of the 55 funded grants that started trials did not result in publications, and another two never started. Among comparisons with control conditions, adding unpublished studies (Hedges' g = 0.20""; 95% CI -0.11~0.51; k = 6) to published studies (g = 0.52 ; 0.37~0.68; k = 20) reduced the psychotherapy effect size point estimate (g = 0.39; ""0.08~0.70) by 25%. Furthermore, these findings may overestimate the 'true' effect of psychological treatment for depression, as outcome reporting bias could not be examined quantitatively. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of psychological interventions for depression has been overestimated in the published literature, as it has been for pharmacotherapy. Both are effective, but not to the extent that the published literature would suggest. Funding agencies and journals should archive both original protocols and raw data from treatment trials to allow detection and correction of bias in reporting of results. Clinicians, guideline developers, and decision makers should be aware that the published literature overestimates the effects of prevailing treatments for depression.",0,0,
566,Does detection and intervention of multiple health-compromising behaviors and mental health disorders among youth attending primary care improve health outcomes? A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Adolescence and early adulthood are important developmental periods. Screening for health-compromising behaviors and mental health disorders during routine primary care visits has the potential to help clinicians identify areas of concern and provide appropriate interventions. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate whether screening and subsequent interventions for multiple health-compromising behaviors and mental health disorders in primary care settings improve youth health outcomes. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, literature searches of Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases (Prospero registry number CRD42013005828) were performed using search terms representing four thematic concepts: primary care, youth, screening and mental health and behaviors that compromise health. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to: include a health outcome measure; include at least 75% of participants under the age of 25; use a screening tool that assesses more than one health domain; and take place within a primary care setting. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Rating Scale. RESULTS: Of 5051 articles identified, nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one pilot RCT, two pooled RCTs, one randomized study with multiple intervention groups and no control group, one Group RCT with two active arms, a longitudinal study and a pre-post study. Seven studies, including two RCTs and one pooled RCT, found positive changes in substance use, diet, sexual health or risky sexual behaviour, alcohol-related risk behaviour, social stress, stress management , helmet use, sleep, and exercise. Of only two studies reporting harms, one reported a negative health outcome of increased alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that the use of screening and intervention with youth for mental health disorders or health compromising behaviors in clinical settings improves health outcomes. Along with other evidence that youth value discussions about health risks with their providers, these discussions should be part of routine primary care for youth. More quality studies are needed to strengthen this evidence.",0,0,
567,Does shared care help in the treatment of depression?,"INTRODUCTION: shared or collaborative care in the treatment of depression is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to be more effective than ordinary general medical care in the treatment of depression; however, it is not yet a government policy in the UK. Our goal was to bring together in one place all the studies that have been carried out, up to mid-2009, to demonstrate evidence that shared collaborative care has important advantages in terms of depression outcomes and cost benefits, to make the case for favor the adoption of this approach in the UK and Europe. METHODS: We conducted a literature search using PUBMED to identify and describe all trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that have been conducted on shared care up to mid-2009. We also described a shared care service for depression that some of us had experienced. involved in the development and work at Luton in the late 1990s. Articles describing trials that had not yet been conducted were excluded, focusing instead on trials that were reported. RESULTS: It has been shown in numerous recent studies that shared care in the treatment of depression, which includes the training of General Practitioners in the treatment of depression, and the provision in Primary Care of a Specialist Nurse or another professional who will provide psycho - education, ensuring medication concordance, and can provide psychotherapy, leads to both better treatment outcomes and higher physician and patient satisfaction, as well as providing some cost benefits, despite somewhat higher immediate costs. This is so in both adult and adolescent patients, while in the case of diabetic patients depression is improved, despite the lack of improvement in glycemic control. The shared care intervention is still useful in the case of patients with resistant depressive symptoms, although a longer entry will be necessary in these cases. Patients with subthreshold depression will not benefit as much and patients expressed more satisfaction when offered psychological interventions. It is also the case that collaborative or shared care is effective in treating depression in the elderly. This is demonstrated by studies that include older patients who also suffer from multiple health conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD, the poorest, those with suicidal ideation, and also in Ethnic Minorities. DISCUSSION: The results described above are mainly based on studies conducted in the US, but similar studies have been reported in the UK and are consistent with the experience of the Luton service we describe. Based on these results, it would seem important that shared, collaborative care, with primary and secondary care physicians (general practitioners and psychiatrists) working as part of a single team, with the help of mental health professionals attached to primary care, but with easy access to secondary care it is a productive way to optimize depression treatment. In the UK, however, it has not yet been possible to develop such a service for the entire population. This is because, in the UK, general practice is run by primary care trusts, while secondary care, including psychiatry, is run by mental health trusts. This has led the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed local care commissioners, to focus on a stepped model for depression treatment, with a key issue being access (or referral) to care. secondary care and discharge back to primary care. , with a group of mental health workers who focus on facilitating (or controlling) these processes, rather than focusing on actually optimizing outcomes of care. CONCLUSION: the evidence advocates the development of collaborative care between primary and secondary care for the treatment of Depression. This will require common medication guidelines in Primary and Secondary Care, easy access for general practitioners to receive advice from psychiatrists about patients, and the use of mental health professionals to provide patients with psychoeducation, treatment concordance support and psychotherapy. . It may be that, to achieve this, services need to be restructured to allow easy communication between professionals.",0,0,
568,"Does therapeutic writing help people with long-term conditions? Systematic review, realistic synthesis and economic considerations","BACKGROUND: Writing therapy to improve physical or mental health can take many forms. The most researched model of therapeutic writing (TW) is unfacilitated individual expressive writing (written emotional disclosure). Facilitated writing activities are less well researched. DATA SOURCES: Databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, were searched from inception to March 2013 (updated at January 2015). METHODS OF REVIEW: Four TW professionals provided expert advice. Study procedures were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies were included. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. TW studies not provided and provided were analyzed separately under the chapter titles of the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Where possible, meta-analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.2.6 (RevMan 2012, The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Costs were estimated from the UK National Health Service perspective and three cost-consequence case studies were prepared. The Realist Synthesis followed the Realist and Metanarrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TW for patients with long-term illness (LTC) compared to no control or other controls, reporting any relevant clinical outcomes. Conduct a realistic synthesis to understand how TW could work and for whom. RESULTS: Of 14,658 unique citations, 284 full-text articles were reviewed and 64 studies (59 RCTs) were included in the final effectiveness reviews. Five studies examined ""facilitated TW""; these were extremely heterogeneous with unclear or high risk of bias, but suggested that facilitated TW interventions may be beneficial in individual LTC. Unfacilitated expressive writing was examined in 59 studies of variable quality or not Overall, there was little or no evidence of any reported benefit in the following conditions (number of studies): human immunodeficiency virus (six), breast cancer (eight), gynecologic and genitourinary cancers (five), general health mental (five), asthma (four), psoriasis (three), and chronic pain (four). In inflammatory arthropathies (six) there was a reduction in disease severity [n = 191, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0 .61, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.96 to -0.26] short-term in meta-analysis of four studies For all other CTLs there were no or few data with no or inconsistent evidence of benefit . The M et-analyses conducted across all LTCs provided no evidence of t Which unfacilitated emotional writing had any effect on depression in the short term (n=1563, SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.17, heterogeneity substantial) or long-term (n=778, SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.10, little heterogeneity) follow-up, or on anxiety, physiological or biomarker-based outcomes. One study reported costs, no studies reported cost-effectiveness, and 12 studies reported resource use; ""and meta-analysis suggested a reduction in medication use but no impact on health center visits. The estimated costs of the intervention were low, but there was insufficient evidence to judge cost-effectiveness. The synthesis findings are realistic suggested that facilitated TM is a complex intervention and that group interaction contributes to perceived benefit It was not clear from the available data who might benefit most from facilitated TM LIMITATION: Difficulties in developing the theory of the facilitation program realistic synthesis meant that the mechanisms operating during TW remain obscure.Overall, there is little evidence to support the therapeutic effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of non-facilitated expressive writing interventions in people with LTC.Further research focused on facilitated TW in people with LTC could be informative STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is re Registered as PROSPERO CRD420120033 43.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Journal handsearches and electronic database searches, conference abstracts, and bibliographies to April 2006; contacts with dressing manufacturers for unpublished studies. STUDIES REVIEWED All randomized controlled trials evaluating dressings applied to venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted and abstracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction sheet. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality. RESULTS The search strategy identified 254 studies; 42 of them met the inclusion criteria. Hydrocolloids were no more effective than plain ones. low-adherence dressings used under compression (8 trials; relative risk of healing with hydrocolloid 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.28). For other comparisons, there was insufficient evidence available to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. None of the dressing comparisons showed evidence that a particular class of dressing healed more ulcers. There were some differences between the dressings in terms of subjective outcomes and ulcer healing rates. The results were not affected by the size or quality of the trials or the unit of randomisation. Insufficient data were available to allow conclusions to be drawn about the relative cost-effectiveness of different dressings. CONCLUSIONS The type of dressing applied under compression was not shown to affect ulcer healing. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the application of hydrocolloid dressings under compression did not produce any benefit in terms of ulcer healing compared to the application of simple low adherent dressings. No conclusive recommendations can be made as to which type of bandage is more cost-effective. Decisions about which dressing to apply should be based on local dressing costs and physician or patient preferences.",0,0,
571,"Driving simulators for detection, evaluation and intervention of occupational therapy","Simulation technology provides safe, objective, and repeatable performance measures related to driver operational (eg, collision avoidance) or tactical (eg, lane keeping) behaviors. Many occupational therapy researchers and others are using driving simulators to test a variety of applications in various populations. A growing body of literature supports associations between simulated driving and actual highway driving. A limitation of malingerer technology is the occurrence of malingerer disease, but there are management strategies to reduce or mitigate its occurrence. Based on a review of the literature and a consensus process, five consensus statements are presented to support the use of driving simulation technology among occupational therapy professionals. Evidence suggests that through the use of driving simulators, occupational therapists can detect underlying deficiencies in driving performance, identify driving errors in drivers at risk; differentiate between the driving performance of healthy and impaired control groups; show driving errors with absolute and relative validity compared to on-road studies and mitigate the appearance of simulator disease. Much progress has been made among occupational therapy researchers and practitioners in the use of driving simulation technology;"" however, empirical support is needed to further justify the use of driving simulators in clinical practice settings such as a valid, reliable, clinically useful and cost-effective tool for driving evaluation and intervention.",0,0,

574,The use of medicines and the role of patients and prescribers,"To advance towards the rational use of medicines in any national or local setting, it is necessary to expand research methods. Both the public and private sectors need to be addressed. In the latter, pharmacists could be studied using a tracker, a fictitious client. An important factor influencing prescribing, drug information, has rarely been scientifically evaluated. However, experimental studies using cluster randomization are feasible even in developing countries.

575,The DRUGS system improves the adherence of Chinese surgeons to guidelines for the use of antibiotics during the perioperative period,"OBJECTIVE: The irrational use of antimicrobial agents to prevent postoperative SSIs is a common phenomenon in China, resulting in increased bacterial resistance, higher hospital infection rates, and additional costs of antimicrobial agents. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the Rational Use of Medicines Guidelines System (DRUGS) on the prescription behavior of antimicrobial agents by the surgeon. METHODS: 10 common surgical operations including 1543 cases (where 778 cases used paper guides and 765 cases used MEDICATIONS) were selected and their demographic and clinical data were collected. Selected operations include thyroid resection, breast mass resection, myomectomy, etc. Evaluation criteria were antibiotic administrative categories, time of initial dose, duration of administration, length of stay, antibiotic costs, SSIs, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). RESULTS: Most of the antimicrobials were administered within 0.5 h to 2 h before the incision, 656 patients (85.75%) underwent surgery with DRUGS and 256 (32.90%) with paper guidelines according to protocol. For clean wound incision, 547 patients (91.62%) were within 24 h of antibiotic withdrawal using paper guides versus 91 (14.79%) using MEDICATION. A total of 19 types of antibiotics were used in the 1543 cases. The top three on the frequency list were piperacillin and sulbactam sodium, cefatiamidine, and cefoperazone. While after the intervention, the frequency list changed to cefazolin, cefatiamidine, cefoperazone. The mean hospital stay was (7.00+/-4.31)d with paper guidelines and (2.54+/-1.57)d with DRUGS, respectively. The average cost of antibiotics was yen (3,481.36+/-2,584.46) with printed guidelines and yen (1,693.39+/-1,478.27) with MEDICATIONS, respectively. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of SSI and ADR between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, greater availability of antibiotic guidelines at the time of medication order, combined with MEDICATION, was associated with greater surgeon adherence to the guidelines.",0,0,
576,Lasting improvements in prostate cancer screening from spaced online education: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is frequently performed, contrary to clinical practice guidelines. BACKGROUND: It was hypothesized that an email-based intervention called 'spaced education' might reduce inappropriate detection of prostate cancer by physicians. DESIGN: The study was conducted as an RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study involved 95 primary care physicians at eight Veterans Affairs medical centers from January 2007 through February 2009. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized into two cohorts: spaced-education physicians received four cycles nine-email isomorphics over 36 weeks (zero to two emails per week), while control physicians received no intervention. Each email presented a clinical scenario and asked if it was appropriate to obtain a PSA test. Participants received immediate feedback after submitting their answers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number and percentage of inappropriate PSA screening tests ordered. Inappropriate testing was defined as the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients older than 76 years or younger than 40 years. The adequacy of screening was dichotomized based on the age of the patient at the time of screening. Patients with PSA tests for reasons other than screening were excluded using a validated protocol. Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for patient grouping by physician. Analyzes were performed in 2009. RESULTS: During the intervention period (weeks 1 to 36), physicians who received spaced educational emails ordered significantly fewer inappropriate PSA screenings than control physicians (10.5% vs. 14.2%, p = 0.041). During the 72-week post-intervention period (weeks 37 to 108), spaced-education clinicians continued to request fewer inappropriate tests compared with controls (7.8% vs. 13.1%, respectively, p = 0.011) , representing a 40% relative reduction in inappropriate testing. put on screen CONCLUSIONS: Spaced education durably improves physicians' prostate cancer screening behaviors and represents a promising new methodology for improving patient care in health care systems.",1,1,
577,Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: Longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study.,"OBJECTIVES Assess whether happiness can be spread from person to person and whether happiness niches are formed within social networks. DESIGN Longitudinal analysis of social networks. SCENARIO Framingham Heart Study social network. PARTICIPANTS 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Happiness measured with a validated scale of four items"";"" wide range of social network attributes and various social ties. RESULTS Groups of happy and unhappy people are visible on the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to three degrees apart (for example, to one's friends' friends' friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are central to the network are more likely to be happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that happiness clusters result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval: 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen for co-resident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next-door neighbors (34%, 7% % to 70%). No effects seen between co-workers. The effect decays over time and with geographic separation. CONCLUSIONS People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they interact. This provides additional justification for viewing happiness, like health, as a collective phenomenon.",0,0,
578,"Dyslipidemia in primary care: prevalence, recognition, treatment and control: data from the German Cardiovascular and Metabolic Risk Project (GEMCAS)","BACKGROUND: Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines define low thresholds for the diagnosis of dyslipidemia using total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide treatment. Although it is mainly a prevention tool, its thresholds are difficult to reach in clinical practice, especially in primary care. METHODS: In a nationwide study with 1,511 primary care physicians and 35,869 patients, we determined the prevalence of dyslipidemia, its recognition, treatment, and control rates. The diagnosis of dyslipidemia was based on CT and LDL-C. Basic descriptive statistics and prevalence rate ratios were calculated, as well as 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia was very common in primary care (76% overall). 48.6% of men and 39.9% of women with dyslipidemia were diagnosed by doctors. However, lifestyle intervention controlled dyslipidemia in about 10% of patients only. A higher proportion (34.1% of men and 26.7% of women) were controlled by receiving pharmacotherapy. The possibility of being diagnosed and subsequently controlled by pharmacotherapy was greater in men (PRR 1.15""; 95% CI 1.12-1.17), in patients with concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with hypertension (PRR 1, 20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37) and cardiovascular disease (PRR 1.46; 95% CI 1.29-1.64), previous myocardial infarction (PRR 1.32; 95% CI 1.19 -1.47), and whether the patients knew they were hypertensive (PRR 1.18; 95% CI 1.04-1.34) or knew about their previous myocardial infarction (PRR 1.17; 95% CI 1.23-1.53). ). CONCLUSION: ESC thresholds appear to be difficult to reach. A simple call for more aggressive treatment or greater patient compliance is apparently not enough to increase the proportion of controlled patients. A shift to multifactorial treatment that considers lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy to reduce weight and lipids may be the only path in a population where simply being normal is certainly not ideal.",0,0,

580,"Early Coverage, Access, Utilization, and Health Effects of Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansions: A Quasi-Experimental Study","Background In 2014, only 26 states and DC chose to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions for low-income adults. Objective To estimate whether state expansions of Medicaid were associated with changes in insurance coverage, health care access and utilization, and self-reported health. Design Comparison of results before and after expansions in states that did and did not expand Medicaid. Establishment of participants US Citizens 19 ¨C64 with family income below 138% of the federal poverty level in the 2010 ¨C2014 National Health Interview Surveys. Measures ""Health insurance coverage (private, Medicaid, no insurance)""; health insurance better than last year; visits to general practitioners and specialists; hospitalizations and emergency department visits; missed or delayed medical care; usual source of care; diagnoses of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension, self-reported health, and depression Results In the second half of 2014, low-income adults in expanding states experienced an increase in health insurance (7.4 percentage points; 95% CI %, ?11.3 to ?3.4) and Medicaid (10.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.5 to 14.5) coverage and higher quality of insurance coverage compared to a year ago ( 7.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.7 to 11.5) compared with adults in states that did not expand Medicaid Medicaid expansions were associated with increased visits to general practice physicians (6.6 percentage points, 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.0), stays ho nocturnal spitalarias (2.4 percentage points, 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.2) and rates of diabetes diagnosis etes (5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 8.1) and high cholesterol (5.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 9.4); changes in other outcomes were not statistically significant.

581,Early detection and intervention evaluation for people at risk of psychosis: a multicentre randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether cognitive therapy is effective in preventing the worsening of emergent psychotic symptoms experienced by young people who seek help and are considered to be at risk of serious illness such as schizophrenia. DESIGN Multisite single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING Various services at five UK sites. PARTICIPANTS 288 participants aged 14 to 35 years (mean 20.74, SD 4.34 years) at high risk for psychosis: 144 were assigned to cognitive therapy plus mental status monitoring and 144 to mental status monitoring alone. Participants were followed for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months. INTERVENTION Cognitive therapy (up to 26 (mean 9.1) sessions over six months) plus mental status monitoring compared with mental status monitoring alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS) scores, which provides a dichotomous transition to psychosis score and ordinal scores for severity of psychotic symptoms and distress. Secondary outcomes included emotional dysfunction and quality of life. RESULTS Transition to psychosis based on intention to treat was analyzed using discrete-time survival models. Overall, the prevalence of transition was lower than expected (23/288"";"" 8%), with no significant difference between the two groups (proportional odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.68). Changes in symptom severity and distress, as well as secondary outcomes, were analyzed using random-effects regression (analysis of covariance) adjusted for baseline site and symptoms. Distress of psychotic symptoms did not differ (estimated difference at 12 months -3.00, 95% confidence interval -6.95 to 0.94), but their severity was significantly reduced in the cognitive therapy group (estimated effect size between groups at 12 months -3.67, -6.71 to -0.64, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS Cognitive therapy plus monitoring did not significantly reduce transition to psychosis or symptom-related distress, but did reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms in high-risk youth. Most of the participants in both groups improved over time. The results have important implications for the concept of mental state at risk.

582,Early detection of autism spectrum disorders: screening between 12 and 24 months of age,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to introduce nurse practitioners (NPs) to information about screening for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in children between 12 and 24 months of age. Recommendations for appropriate referrals and initiation of early intervention (EI) are also provided. DATA SOURCES: Review of the published literature on ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ASD exhibit social interaction problems, verbal and nonverbal communication deficits, and repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped patterns of behavior or interests. Studies show that these children benefit from starting intensive EI as soon as possible. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early detection allows children with suspected ASD to be evaluated by specialists and admitted to treatment programs as soon as possible. Due to the importance of early diagnosis of ASD, it is critical that NPs use established screening instruments to maximize time and increase reliability of assessment.",0,0,

584,Early training to address patient obesity: a systematic review of nursing education,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to identify studies that have evaluated educational interventions in the training of undergraduate nurses regarding obesity and to investigate the effectiveness of the interventions. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a prominent global problem and nurses have an increasing role in weight management with patients. The literature has identified several theory-based behavior change techniques that successfully help patients control their weight. Therefore, training nurses in obesity-related behavior change techniques is appropriate to prepare them for their future professional role. However, the effectiveness of these educational interventions has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: The Center for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines informed this systematic review. Systematic searches of four databases were performed and articles were assessed against the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment forms were developed and completed to identify salient features of the articles. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two included baseline and outcome measures, one of which was a randomized controlled trial. Furthermore, only one study included an explicitly identified behavior change technique. Interventions were delivered through a variety of methods; however, quality assessment indicated that all studies had poor methodologies and high risks of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in this area of research are scarce and methodologically unsound. Therefore, it is not possible to identify effective educational interventions for nursing students on weight control. IMPLICATIONS: More robust research is needed to investigate how nurses can be trained to facilitate weight management. Greater transparency of descriptions of interventions, particularly around the behavior change techniques that were taught, would allow for replication and proper evaluation. Until then, it is not known whether current teaching adequately equips nurses to manage overweight and obese patients.",0,0,
585,Early treatment of migraine attacks with triptans: a strategy to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction?,"Early treatment of migraine attacks with triptans may be more effective than delayed administration of triptans. However, in published studies, the definition of 'early' varied (in terms of timing, intensity of pain, or presence of allodynia) or was unclear. Therefore, no clear clinical indications have been established. Properly designed trials to address this issue remain a priority. Early treatment with triptans may also have drawbacks, including inadvertent treatment of tension-type headaches and the danger of medication overuse. Currently, only migraineurs with rapidly worsening pain, a high rate of pain recurrence, and clinical indications of allodynia should be encouraged to take triptans as quickly as possible. This recommendation implies a requirement for patient education and the need to carefully tailor treatment to individual needs.",0,0,
586,Eating behavior disorders in children and adolescents: pharmacological therapies,"Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa exist in childhood, often begin in adolescence, and can have serious medical and psychiatric sequelae that impede physical, emotional, and behavioral development. Although we use the same definitions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version 4 [DSM-IV] to diagnose eating disorders in children, adolescents, and adults, these disorders may be expressed somewhat differently in younger populations, requiring evaluation and treatment procedures that are tailored to your developmental needs. Significant advances have been made in recent years in our understanding of treatments for eating disorders in adults and, specifically, pharmacological treatments for these disorders. Multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have documented the short-term efficacy of antidepressant medications in bulimia nervosa. Although the usefulness of pharmacological treatments for the acute treatment of anorexia nervosa is less clear, recent evidence suggests a role for medication in the relapse prevention stage of the disease. Most trials of medications for eating disorders have been conducted with adults, and the literature on the pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents with these disorders is very limited. This review article summarizes the current literature on the role of medication in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, with special emphasis on studies conducted in populations of children and adolescents.",0,0,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Fertility clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty fertility specialists from Australia and New Zealand who were members of the Fertility Society of Australia. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES(S): Responses to an online questionnaire completed anonymously. RESULT(S): Approximately 54% of clinicians correctly identified the relevant body mass index for anorexia nervosa, and 30% identified menstrual disorders for anorexia, while 63.8% of clinicians incorrectly nominated the relevant BMI for anorexia nervosa. Maladaptive weight control behaviors as a feature of binge eating disorder. While physicians (83.7%) agreed that it was important to screen for eating disorders during preconception screenings, 35% were routinely screened and 8.8% indicated that their clinics had Clinical practice guidelines for the management of eating disorders. A minority of participants (13.8%) felt satisfied with their level of college education in eating disorders, 37.5% of clinicians were confident in their ability to recognize eating disorder symptoms, and 96.2% indicated that he needed more education and clinical guidelines. For most items examined, clinical knowledge and practices regarding eating disorders did not differ by physician sex or years of clinical experience working as a fertility specialist. CONCLUSION(S): Knowledge about eating disorders in the context of fertility treatment is important. This study highlights the uncertainty among fertility specialists in detecting the characteristics of eating disorders. The findings point to the importance of further education and training, including the development of specific clinical guidelines for fertility healthcare providers.",0,0,
588,Economic Analysis of the Be Fit Be Well Program: A Weight Loss Program for Community Health Centers,"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force has released new guidelines on obesity, urging primary care physicians to provide obese patients with intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions. However, there are few studies of weight loss in real-world nonacademic primary care, and even fewer in low-income racial/ethnic minority samples. OBJECTIVE: To assess the recruitment, intervention, and replication costs of a 2-year moderate-intensity weight loss and blood pressure control intervention. DESIGN: A comprehensive cost analysis was conducted associated with a weight loss and hypertension control program administered at three community health centers as part of a pragmatic randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty-five high-risk, low-income, inner-city, hypertensive, and obese minority (71% Black/African American and 13% Hispanic) patients. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included total recruitment costs and intervention costs, cost per participant, and incremental costs per unit of weight and blood pressure reduction. KEY FINDINGS: Recruitment and intervention costs were estimated at $2,359 per participant for the 2-year program. Compared to the control intervention, the cost per additional kilogram lost was $2204/kg, and for blood pressure, $621/mmHg. Sensitivity analyzes suggest that if the program were offered to a larger sample and minor modifications were made, the cost per participant could be reduced to the levels of many commercially available products. CONCLUSIONS: Costs associated with the Be Fit Be Well program were found to be significantly more expensive than many commercially available products and much higher than the amount the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reimburses physicians for obesity counseling. However, given the serious and costly health consequences associated with obesity in high-risk, multimorbid, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, the resources required to provide interventions such as those described here may still be cost-effective with respect to producing behavior change over time. long term.",0,0,

These strategies are becoming increasingly popular in health care, especially in light of growing concerns about quality of care and resource limits. But such concerns have hardly motivated health authorities and other decision makers to spend on some form of economic evaluation in their evaluations of implementation strategies.

590,Economic implications of evidence-based prescribing for hypertension: can better care cost less?,"Context Deviation from evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of hypertension is common, but its economic impact has not been rigorously studied. Suboptimal prescribing patterns contribute to the high cost of medications for older patients, as well as the difficulty of providing affordable prescription drug benefits for older Americans. Objective To estimate the potential savings from the perspective of health care payers that would result from greater adherence to evidence-based recommendations for the management of hypertension in patients older than 65 years. Design Comparative analysis of prescribed medications vs. potential regimens suggested by evidence-based guidelines adapted to the medical history of each patient, with cost calculations for both actual and evidence-based regimens. Setting and patients A total of 133,624 patients being treated for hypertension during 2001 who were enrolled in a large state pharmaceutical assistance program that provides prescription drug insurance for seniors. Main outcome measure Cost difference between drugs actually prescribed and regimens suggested by evidence-based guidelines. Results The patients studied filled more than 2.05 million prescriptions for antihypertensive medications in 2001, at an annual program cost of $48.5 million ($363 per patient). We identified 815,316 prescriptions (40%) for which an alternative regimen seemed more appropriate based on evidence-based recommendations. Such changes would have reduced costs to payers in 2001 by $11.6 million (nearly a quarter of the program's spending on antihypertensive drugs), as well as being more clinically appropriate overall. Replacement of calcium channel blockers resulted in the greatest potential savings. Using price caps similar to those in the Medicaid program would have resulted in an even greater potential savings of $20.5 million (42% of program costs). Conclusions Compliance with evidence-based prescribing guidelines for hypertension could result in substantial savings in prescription costs for elderly patients with hypertension that would amount to savings of around $1.2 billion nationally. Identifying similar areas where prescribing can be improved will be critical to the affordability of prescription drug benefit programs.",0,0,

Several organizational and educational strategies have been proposed to improve the treatment of depression. The clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies have not yet been subjected to a systematic review. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the efficacy of organizational and educational interventions to improve the treatment of depression in primary care settings. DATA SOURCES: Electronic medical and psychological databases were searched from inception to March 2003 (MEDLINE, PsycLIT, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database, Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group register and Cochrane and register of specialists of the Organizational Change Group)""; correspondence maintained with the authors;"" and lists of references used. Search terms related to depression, primary care, and all organizational and educational guidelines and interventions. STUDY SELECTION: We selected 36 studies, including 29 randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized controlled clinical trials, 5 controlled before-and-after studies, and 2 interrupted time-series studies. Results related to treatment and depression outcome were sought. DATA EXTRACTION: Methodological details and results were extracted and checked by two reviewers. Summary relative risks were calculated, where possible, from the original data and attempts were made to correct for unit of analysis error. DATA SYNTHESIS: A narrative synthesis was performed. We found 21 studies with positive results. Effective strategies to improve overall patient outcome were those with complex interventions that incorporated physician education, an enhanced role for the nurse (nursing case management), and a greater degree of integration between primary and secondary care (medical consultation). -link). Telephone medication counseling by practice nurses or trained counselors was also effective. Simple implementation of guidelines and educational strategies were generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial potential to improve the management of depression in primary care. Commonly used educational guidelines and strategies are likely to be ineffective. Implementation of the findings of this research will require a substantial investment in primary care services and a major change in the organization and delivery of care.",0,0,
594,Educational Intervention in the Knowledge and Performance of Vaccination against Hepatitis B in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus of Residents of Primary Care,"OBJECTIVES: Although guidelines recommend hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization for adults with diabetes mellitus (DM), vaccination rates remain low. Our aim was to assess knowledge and practice regarding HBV and to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted educational program. METHODS: Primary care residents (n = 244) from three academic institutions were surveyed on various aspects of HBV. Residents in a training program were then randomly assigned to an educational intervention (E) (n = 20) and a control (C) group (n = 19). Group E received a focused didactic lecture and regular email reminders with immediate feedback. We compared knowledge scores before and after the intervention. Chart audits were conducted to assess resident behavior. RESULTS: A total of 103 (42%) residents responded to the survey. The survey indicated that residents lacked the necessary knowledge and risk assessment skills regarding HBV in patients with DM. In the controlled trial of intervention E, both groups had similar baseline knowledge scores. Group E had a significant increase in knowledge scores immediately post-intervention from a mean of 29% at baseline to 70% (P < 0.001) that was maintained 6 months post-intervention (65%; P < 0.001). ). In group C, scores at 6 months post-intervention were not different from baseline (38% vs. 29%). No significant differences were observed in documentation skills. CONCLUSIONS: A combined educational program was effective in improving knowledge about HBV and vaccination in DM, but had limited influence on physician practice. Further studies incorporating system changes along with educational initiatives to improve clinical practice are required.",0,1,
595,Educational interventions for general practitioners to identify and manage depression as a risk factor for suicide in young people: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health problem and, globally, is the second leading cause of death in young adults. Globally, there are 164,000 suicides per year in young people under 25 years of age. Depression is a strong risk factor for suicide. Evidence shows that 45% of those who commit suicide, including young adults, contact their general practitioner rather than a mental health professional in the month before their death. More evidence indicates that general practitioners do not detect and treat risk factors or early warning signs of suicide in young people. Healthcare-based suicide prevention interventions targeting general practitioners are designed to increase identification of at-risk youth. The rationale for this type of intervention is that early identification and improved clinical management of those at risk will reduce morbidity and mortality. This systematic review will synthesize the evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions for general practitioners in the identification and management of depression as a risk factor for suicide in young people. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis following the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adhere to the reporting guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement recommendations. . We will systematically search electronic databases for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions for general practitioners in identifying and managing depression as a risk factor for suicide in young people compared to any other intervention, no intervention, usual care or waiting. ready. Gray literature will be searched by screening trial registers. Only studies published in English will be included. No date restrictions will apply. Two authors will independently review the titles and abstracts of potential studies. The primary outcome is identification and treatment of depression. Secondary outcomes are suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, deliberate self-harm, knowledge of suicide risk factors and suicide-related behaviours, attitudes towards suicide risk and suicide-related behaviours, confidence to treat suicide risk factors and suicide-related behaviors. DISCUSSION: Our study will inform the development of future educational interventions and provide evidence of feasibility and acceptability, to help general practitioners identify and manage suicidal behavior in young people.

Strategies should be developed to improve the prescription of antibiotics. Our purpose is to review educational programs aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing by physicians and/or antibiotic dispensing by pharmacists, both in primary care and hospital settings. METHODS: We conducted a critical systematic search and review of the relevant literature on educational programs aimed at improving the practice of prescribing and dispensing antibiotics in hospital and primary care settings, published from January 2001 to December 2011. RESULTS: We identified 78 studies for analysis, 47 in primary care and 31 in a hospital setting. The studies differed widely in design but mostly reported positive results. Outcomes measured in the studies reviewed were adherence to guidelines, total antibiotics prescribed, or both, attitudes and behavior related to antibiotic prescribing, and quality of antibiotic-related pharmacy practice. Twenty-nine studies (62%) in primary care and twenty-four (78%) in hospital settings reported positive results for all outcomes measured""; fourteen studies (30%) in primary care and six (20%) in hospital settings reported positive results for some outcomes and outcomes that were not statistically influenced by the intervention for others;"" only four studies in primary care and one study in a hospital setting failed to report significant post-intervention improvements for all outcomes. Improvement in adherence to guidelines and reduction in total antibiotics prescribed, after educational interventions, were observed in 46% and 41% of all studies reviewed, respectively. Changes in behavior related to antibiotic prescribing and improvement in the quality of pharmacy practice, respectively, were observed in four studies and one study, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results show that the use of antibiotics could be improved through educational interventions, being mostly used multifaceted interventions.",0,0,
597,Educational visits and prescription of sedative-hypnotics in general practice,"Public concern about the prescription of sedative-hypnotics (primarily benzodiazepines) led to a controlled trial of an educational intervention to promote rational prescribing by general practitioners (GPs). This paper describes the educational intervention and its evaluation process. In urban and rural New South Wales, 137 GPs were visited during office hours by a GP or pharmacist who had received training in communication skills. Material offered to GPs included relaxation tapes and a problem-oriented management guideline booklet. The interview had three stages: rapport was established, then educational material was presented, and finally, the visitor sought the physician's consent to review five long-term benzodiazepine patients. The visits were well received. Several measures were written to reflect physicians' motivation and interest in non-pharmacological management"";"" There was virtually no correlation between any of these process measures and the outcome of the trial: a change in prescribing behavior. Self-assessment of benzodiazepine prescribing greatly underestimated actual self-reported prescribing incidents. We take this as a reminder that we don't always do what we want to do, and we don't always do what we think we do.",0,0,
598,Effect of a computerized body mass index indicator on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity in adults.,"Background: In obese adults, physicians often fail to identify obesity and recommend treatments for it. We sought to determine whether a computerized body mass index (BMI) chart would increase the likelihood that GP patients would be diagnosed with obesity and referred for obesity treatment. Methods: A total of 846 obese patients from 37 family physicians were randomly assigned to have either a patient BMI chart indicator placed on their electronic medical record (intervention group) or no BMI indicator placed (intervention group). comparison) in the registry. . We then examine the patients' medical records for evidence of an obesity diagnosis and referrals for specific obesity treatments. We also measured whether the presence of comorbidities in obese patients influenced the likelihood of diagnoses and treatment by physicians. Results: Obese patients of physicians who had a BMI chart in their medical records were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis of obesity than obese patients of physicians who did not have a BMI chart (16.6% versus 10.7% "";"" P= .016). Patients of physicians who were provided with a BMI chart were also more likely than patients of physicians who did not receive a chart to receive a referral for dietary management (14.0% vs. 7.3%, p=0.002 ) and exercise (12.1%). versus 7.1%, p = 0.016). Of the obesity comorbidities, only obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was a predictor of a patient being diagnosed with obesity (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.281, 0.869, p=0.014). Conclusions: The inclusion of a computerized BMI chart increased the likelihood that physicians would diagnose obesity in obese patients and refer them for treatment.",0,1,
599,Effect of minimal pharmaceutical intervention in improving adherence to asthma guidelines.,"Objective To study the effectiveness of a minimal intervention strategy to improve adherence to pediatric asthma guidelines. Design and setting A group of pharmacists were encouraged to discuss the essential elements of asthma care with the general practitioners with whom they normally work. Adherence to the guidelines was evaluated through the study of prescriptions for children with asthma. We compared the treatment of children registered in pharmacies that participated in the study (intervention group) with a control group of children registered in other non-participating pharmacies (reference group) and with the results of a previous study. Main outcome measures The number of children who did not receive short-acting betamimetics, inhaled corticosteroids while receiving long-acting betamimetics, and more than one type of inhaler. Results Significantly fewer children did not receive short-acting betamimetics in the intervention group (176/1447 vs. 534/3527""; p<0.01) and fewer children did not receive inhaled corticosteroids but received long-acting betamimetics. (6/219 vs. 41/477; p=0.03) The number of children who had more than one type of inhaler was the same in both groups (5.1%), but was significantly lower compared to the study above (119/2311 vs. 239/3217;"" p<0.01).

600,Effect of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the prevention of major depression in adults with subthreshold depression.,"Importance Evidence-based treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are not very successful in improving health and functional outcomes. Attention has increasingly focused on the prevention of MDD. Objective To assess the efficacy of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the prevention of MDD. Design, Setting, and Participants Two-arm randomized clinical trial conducted between March 1, 2013, and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited in Germany from the general population through a large public health insurance company (es i.e. insurance funded by joint ventures employee contributions). Participants included 406 self-selected adults with subthreshold depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score 16, without current MDD according to criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] ). Interventions All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (primary care physician visits) and were randomized to a web-based guided self-help intervention (cognitive behavioral and problem-solving therapy supported by an online coach). ""; n?=?202) or a web-based psychoeducation program (n?=?204). Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the intervention group relative to the group control over a 12-month follow-up period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period up to the previous assessment. Results Among 406 randomized patients (mean age, 45 years; 73.9% women), 335 (82%) completed telephone follow-up at 12 months. participants (27%) in the intervention group experienced MDD compared to 84 participants (41%) in the control group. Cox regression analysis controlling for baseline Depressive symptom severity revealed a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P = .002) at 12-month follow-up . The number needed to treat to prevent 1 new case of MDD was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9-14.6). Conclusions and relevance Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months. More research is needed to understand whether the effects are generalizable for both first-onset depression and recurrence of depression, as well as efficacy without the use of an online coach.",0,0,
601,Effect of an educational program (PEGASE) on cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic patients,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown a gap between guidelines for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and their implementation in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The PEGASE education program has been designed with the aim of improving the management of patients at high risk of CVD. METHODS: In a multicenter study conducted between 2001 and 2004 in France, 96 participating physicians were randomized into a ""trained"" group, which included 398 ""educated"" patients, and an ""untrained"" group, which included 242 ""uneducated patients."" . The educated patients received six educational sessions in the hospital, four collective and two individual. Framingham score, smoking status, lipid levels, blood glucose, blood pressure, dietary intake, and drug compliance, as well as quality of life, were assessed at baseline (M0) and at 6 months ( M6). The primary endpoint of the study was the effectiveness of the PEGASE program in reducing the overall risk of CVD in high-risk patients. RESULTS: The Framingham score was calculated for 473 patients. The Framingham score was significantly improved at M6 versus M0 in the education group (13.0 +/- 8.21 versus 13.6 +/- 8.48, d = -0.658, p = 0.016), but not in the group with no education (12.5 +/- 8.19 vs. 12.4 +/- 7.81, d = +0.064, p = 0.836)"";"" the mean change between the two groups did not reach significance. Quality of life, LDL-c level, and diet scores improved only in the ""educated"" group. CONCLUSIONS: The PEGASE education program improved CVD risk factors, although the global assessment using the Framingham score was not significantly different between groups. This program, designed to meet the needs and expectations of patients and doctors, was easily implemented in all hospitals.",0,0,
602,Effect of an outpatient antimicrobial stewardship intervention on broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing by primary care pediatricians: a randomized trial.,"Importance Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been effective for hospitalized patients, often through prescription audits and feedback.

604,Effect of peer-reviewed audit and feedback on prescribing and test ordering performance of general practitioners: a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Much of the research around the world focuses on cost containment and better compliance with guidelines in health care. Research that focuses on professional behavior is often conducted in a well-controlled research environment. In this study, a large-scale implementation of a peer-review strategy was tested on both evidence-ordering and prescribing behavior in primary care in the normal quality-improvement setting. METHODS: We planned a cluster RCT in existing local quality improvement collaborations (LQICs) in primary care. The study was conducted from January 2008 to January 2011. LQICs were randomly assigned to one of two trial arms, with each arm receiving the same audit and feedback intervention combined with peer review. Both arms were offered five different clinical subjects and acted as blind controls for the other arm. Differences in test request rates and prescription rates between the two arms were analyzed in a pre-post intention-to-treat analysis and in a per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one LQIC groups, including 197 physicians working in 88 practices, entered the trial. Intention-to-treat analysis did not show a difference in changes in test ordering or prescribing performance between the intervention and control groups. Per-protocol analysis showed positive results for half of the clinical subjects. The increase in total tests ordered was 3% in the intervention arm and 15% in the control arm. By prescription, the increase in prescriptions was 20% in the intervention arm and 66% in the control group. It was observed that the groups with the highest test orders and prescription volumes at the start of the study showed the greatest improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the results of the previous work could not be confirmed by our attempt to implement the strategy in the field. We did not see a decrease in volumes of tests ordered or medications prescribed, but we were able to show a minor increase instead. The implementation of peer review with audit and feedback proved to be infeasible in primary care in the Netherlands.

605,"Effect of audit and feedback, and reminder messages on primary care radiology referrals: a randomized trial.","Background Radiological tests are often used by general practitioners (GPs). These tests can be overused and contribute little to clinical management. The objective was to evaluate two methods to reduce requests for radiological tests by GPs in accordance with the UK Royal College of Radiologists guidelines on radiographs of the lumbar spine and knee. Methods We evaluated audit and feedback and educational reminder messages in six radiology departments and 244 general practices they served. The study was a pragmatic, before-and-after, cluster randomized controlled trial with a 2·2 factorial design. A randomized subset of GP patient records were reviewed for consistency with guidelines. The main outcome measure was the number of requests for radiographs per 1000 patients per year. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings The effect of educational reminder messages (i.e. change in request rate after intervention) was an absolute change of -1 53 (95% CI -2 5 to -0 57) for lumbar spine and -1 61 (-2 6 to -0 62) for knee radiographs, both relative reductions of about 20%. The effect of audit and feedback was an absolute change from -0 07 (-1 3 to 0 9) for lumbar spine to 0 04 (-0 95 to 1 03) for requests for radiographs of knee, both relative reductions of about 1%. Agreement between groups did not differ significantly. Interpretation Bi-annual feedback of audit data is not effective, but the attached routine of educational reminder messages to radiographs is effective and does not affect the quality of references. Any radiology department that handles referrals from primary care could perform this intervention with good results.",1,1,
606,Effect of behavior modification on outcome in early-to-moderate chronic kidney disease: a cluster-randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Due to recent changes in our understanding of the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the importance of lifestyle modification to prevent progression of renal dysfunction and complications has become obvious. Furthermore, effective cooperation between general practitioners (GPs) and nephrologists is essential to ensure a better system of care for the treatment of CKD. In this cluster-randomized study, we studied the effect of behavior modification on outcome in early-to-moderate stage CKD. DESIGN: Stratified open cluster randomized trial. SETTING: A total of 489 physicians belonging to 49 local medical associations (clusters) in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,379 patients (1,195 in group A (standard intervention) and 1,184 in group B (advanced intervention)) aged between 40 and 74 years, who had CKD and were in consultation with GPs. INTERVENTION: All patients were managed according to current CKD guidelines. Group B groups received three additional interventions: patients received an educational intervention for lifestyle modification and a CKD status letter, in an attempt to prevent them from dropping out of treatment, and physicians in group B received of data to facilitate bridging the gap between goal and practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measures were 1) rate of non-compliance to accept continuous medical follow-up of patients, 2) rate of collaboration between GPs and nephrologists, and 3) progression of CKD. . RESULTS: The rate of discontinuous clinic visits was significantly lower in group B (16.2% in group A vs. 11.5% in group B, p = 0.01). In group B, significantly higher rates of referral and co-treatment were observed (p<0.01). The average rate of deterioration of eGFR tended to be lower in group B (group A: 2.6+/-5.8 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, group B: 2.4+/-5 .1 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, p = 0.07). A significant difference was observed in the rate of deterioration of eGFR in subjects with stage 3 CKD (group A: 2.4+/-5.9 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, group B: 1.9 +/-4.4 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our system of care achieved behavioral change in CKD patients, i.e., significantly lower discontinuous clinic visits, and behavior change in both GPs and nephrologists, i.e., referral rates and significantly higher co-treatment rates, resulting in delayed CKD progression, especially in patients with stage 3 proteinuric CKD.

607,Effect of behavioral interventions on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among primary care practices: a randomized clinical trial,"IMPORTANCE: Interventions based on behavioral science could reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing (not consistent with guidelines) during outpatient visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled physicians randomly assigned to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions over 18 months. All physicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines at the time of enrollment. Interventions began between November 1, 2011, and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for late-onset sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented sets of electronic commands suggesting treatments without antibiotics; responsible justification led physicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into patients' electronic health records; the peer comparison sent emails to doctors who compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of the ""best performers"" (those with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescription rates for visits with inappropriate antibiotic diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months before the intervention to 18 months after, adjusting for the effects of each intervention for interventions. concurrent and pre-intervention trends, with random effects for practices and clinicians. RESULTS: There were 14,753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory infections during the reference period and 16,959 visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67% women) during the intervention period Mean antibiotic prescription rates decreased from 24.1% at baseline to 13.1% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, -11.0%) for control practices , from 22.1% to 6.1% (absolute difference, -16.0%) for the suggested alternatives (difference-in-differences, -5.0% [95% CI, -7.8% to 0.1% ]; P = 0.66 for differences in trajectories); 23.2% to 5.2% (absolute difference, -18.1%) for responsible justification (difference-in-differences, -7.0% [95% CI, -9.1% to -2.9%] ; P < .001) and 19.9% to 3.7% (absolute difference, -16.3%) for pairwise comparison (difference-in-differences, -5.2% [95% CI, -6, 9% to -1.6%];"" P < 0.001).

608,Effect of clinical decision support systems: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing emphasis on the role of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) in improving care and reducing costs, evidence to support widespread use is lacking. PURPOSE: To assess the effect of CDSS on clinical outcomes, healthcare processes, workload and efficiency, patient satisfaction, cost, and provider usage and implementation. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science as of January 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Investigators independently screened reports to identify English-published randomized trials of electronic CDSS that were implemented in clinical settings""; used by providers to aid in point-of-care decision making, and reported clinical, care process, workload, relationship-focused, financial, or provider usage outcomes DATA EXTRACTION: Researchers extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and quality.DATA SYNTHESIS: We included 148 randomized controlled trials.28 (86%) evaluated health care process measures, 29 (20%) evaluated clinical outcomes and 22 (15%) measured costs Both commercially and locally developed CDSS improved measures of the process of medical care related to the provision of preventive services (n= 25; odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.58]), ranking trials (n=20; OR, 1.72 [CI, 1.47 to 2.00] ) and prescription of therapies (n= 46; OR, 1.57 [CI, 1.35 to 1.82]). Few studies measured possible unintended consequences or adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: Studies were heterogeneous in terms of interventions, populations, publication bias and selective reporting cannot be excluded. CONCLUSION: Locally and commercially developed CDSS are effective in improving health care process measures in various settings, but evidence for clinical, economic, workload, and efficiency outcomes remains sparse. The review furthers knowledge in the field by demonstrating the benefits of CDSS outside of experienced academic centers.",0,1,
609,Effect of computer-assisted implementation of the European Best Practice Guideline on adherence and goal achievement: ORAMA results.,"Background: The success of guidelines largely depends on their effective implementation and acceptance in clinical practice. The Optimal Assessment of Management of Renal Anemia (ORAMA) study investigated the impact of European best practice guidelines (EBPGs) on patient outcomes. Methods: ORAMA was a prospective, international, multicenter, cluster-randomized study. Fifty-three centers in eight European countries enrolled patients with stage V chronic kidney disease receiving chronic dialysis. Patients were anemic (hemoglobin [Hb] <11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and/or iron supplements. Centers were randomly assigned to two groups, with or without access to a computerized clinical decision support (CDS) system. In a post hoc analysis, patients were subdivided into investigators' adherence or non-adherence to the EBPG, regardless of CDS use. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with Hb >11 g/dL (110 g/L), reflecting hematologic targets on the revised EPBG. Results: In this population of 599 dialysis patients, hematologic endpoints did not differ in the presence or absence of a CDS system. There was a general shift towards a better distribution of patients by Hb categories while the width of the distribution curves remained unchanged. The proportion of patients with Hb >11 g/dl (110 g/l) was higher among adherents (79% and 84% with or without CDS use, respectively) than among non-adherents (59% and 57%, respectively). ). Conclusions: ORAMA is the first international study that shows that adherence to the EBPG improves the achievement of anemia rates. The availability of a CDS system did not affect anemia management.",0,1,

Design: A pragmatic before-and-after cluster randomized controlled trial using a two-by-two incomplete block design. Setting: 60 general practices in the North East of England. Participants: General practitioners and practice nurses in the study practices and their patients aged 18 years or older with angina or asthma. Main outcome measures: Compliance with guidelines, based on review of patient-reported case notes and generic and condition-specific outcome measures. Results: The computerized decision support system had no significant effect on consultation rates, measures of the process of care (including prescribing), or patient-reported outcomes for any of the conditions. Software usage levels were low. Conclusions: No effect of evidence-based computerized guidelines on the management of asthma or angina in adults in primary care was found. This was probably due to low levels of software usage, despite the system being optimized as far as technically possible. Even if the technical issues of producing a system that fully supports chronic disease management are resolved, the challenge of integrating the systems into clinical settings where busy clinicians manage patients with multiple and complex conditions remains.",0,1,

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and registries of ongoing trials up to October 2009. We also checked study references. Study selection Design: Randomized controlled trials or non-randomized controlled studies (group or individual) published in peer-reviewed journals. POPULATION sedentary individuals with or without a medical diagnosis. Exercise referral schemes defined as: clear referrals by primary care professionals to outside service providers to increase physical activity or exercise, individual-tailored physical activity or exercise programs, and initial assessment and follow-up throughout of the programs. Comparators: usual care, no intervention, or alternative exercise referral schemes. RESULTS Eight randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and compared exercise referral schemes with usual care (six trials), alternative physical activity intervention (two), and an exercise referral scheme plus a self-determination theory intervention. (one). Compared with usual care, follow-up data for exercise bypass schemes showed a greater number of participants achieving between 90 and 150 minutes of physical activity of at least moderate intensity per week (pooled relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence intervals 1.03 to 1.30) and a reduced level of depression (pooled standardized mean difference -0.82, -1.28 to -0.35). Evidence of a difference between groups in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity or other health outcomes was inconsistent at follow-up. No differences in outcomes were found between the exercise bypass schemes and the other two comparison groups. None of the included trials separately reported outcomes in individuals with specific medical diagnoses. Significant heterogeneity in the quality and nature of exercise referral schemes between studies could have contributed to inconsistency in results. Conclusions Considerable uncertainty remains as to the effectiveness of baseline exercise schedules in increasing physical activity, fitness, or health indicators, or whether they are an efficient use of resources for sedentary people with or without a medical diagnosis. .",0,0,

617,Effect of integrated care for sick list patients with chronic low back pain: economic evaluation in conjunction with a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit of an integrated care program compared with usual care for sick list patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation in conjunction with a randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals) in the Netherlands, 2005-9. PARTICIPANTS: 134 adults aged 18 to 65 years registered ill due to chronic low back pain: 66 were randomized to integrated care and 68 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Integrated care consisted of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics, with the participation of a supervisor, and a program of graded activities based on cognitive-behavioral principles. Usual care was provided by general practitioners and occupational physicians according to Dutch guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was duration to sustainable return to work. The secondary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), measured by EuroQol. RESULTS: Total costs in the integrated care group (£13,165, SD pound13,600) were significantly lower than in the usual care group (£18,475, SD pound13,616). Cost-effectiveness plans and acceptability curves showed that integrated care was cost-effective compared to usual care for return to work and QALYs gained. Cost-benefit analyzes showed that each pound1 invested in integrated care would generate an estimated pound26. The net societal benefit of integrated care compared to usual care was £5,744. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an integrated care program for ill patients with chronic low back pain has great potential to significantly reduce societal costs, increase care effectiveness, improve quality of life, and improve function on a large scale. Therefore, integrated care has great benefits for patients and society, as well as for employers.",0,0,

619,"Effect of intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behavior, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake in children: the Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) school-based cluster randomized controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of a school intervention to increase physical activity, reduce sedentary lifestyle and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables in children. DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING 60 primary schools in the South West of England. PARTICIPANTS Primary school children who were in school year 4 (age 8-9 years) at recruitment and baseline assessment, in year 5 during the intervention, and at the end of year 5 (age 9-10) in the follow-up evaluation. INTERVENTION The Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) intervention consisted of teacher training, provision of interactive lesson and homework plans for children and parents, all necessary lesson and homework materials, and written materials for school newsletters and parents. The intervention was administered when the children were in school year 5 (age 9-10 years). Schools assigned to the control received standard teaching. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The prespecified primary outcomes were minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity assessed by accelerometer per day, minutes of sedentary behavior assessed by accelerometer per day, and reported daily consumption of servings of fruits and vegetables. RESULTS 60 schools with more than 2221 children were recruited"";"" valid data were available for fruit and vegetable consumption for 2121 children, for accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior for 1252 children, and for secondary outcomes for between 1825 and 2212 children for the main analyses. None of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools assigned to the AFLY5 intervention and those assigned to the control group. The mean difference comparing the intervention group with the control group was -1.35 (95% confidence interval -5.29 to 2.59) minutes per day for moderate to vigorous physical activity, -0.11 (-9.71 to 9.49) minutes per day for sedentary behavior, and 0.08 (-0.12 to 0.28) servings per day for fruit and vegetable consumption. The intervention was effective for three of nine of the secondary outcomes after multiple tests were taken into account: self-reported time spent looking at screens at the weekend (-21 (-37 to -4) minutes per day), self-reported servings snacks per day (-0.22 (-0.38 to -0.05)) and energy drink servings per day (-0.26 (-0.43 to -0.10)) were reduced. The results of a series of sensitivity analyzes testing different assumptions about missing data and per-protocol analyzes produced similar results. CONCLUSION The findings suggest that the AFLY5 school-based intervention is not effective in increasing physical activity levels, decreasing sedentary behavior, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake in primary school children. Change in these activities may require more intensive behavioral interventions with children or prior interventions at the family and social level, as well as at the level of the school environment. These findings have relevance to researchers, policymakers, public health professionals, and clinicians involved in health promotion, policy formulation, and service delivery.

620,Effect of offering different levels of support and free nicotine replacement therapy through an English national quitline: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of free nicotine replacement therapy or proactive telephone advice in addition to standard smoking cessation support offered through a quitline. DESIGN Parallel group, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial. SETTING National Quitline, England. PARTICIPANTS 2591 non-pregnant smokers aged 16 years or older residing in England who called the quitline between February 2009 and February 2010 and agreed to a quit date: 648 were randomized to standard support, proactive support or proactive support with nicotine replacement therapy, and 647 were randomized to receive standard support with nicotine replacement therapy. INTERVENTIONS Two interventions were offered in addition to standard support: 6-week nicotine replacement therapy, free and proactive counseling sessions (repeated phone calls and interaction with cessation counsellors). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported smoking cessation for six or more months after the quit date. The secondary outcome was cessation validated by exhaled carbon monoxide measured at six or more months. RESULTS At six months, 17.7% (n = 229) of those who received nicotine replacement therapy reported quitting compared to 20.1% (n = 261) who did not receive such therapy (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.04) and 18.2% (n=236) who offered proactive advice reported quitting compared to 19.6% (n=254 ) that offered standard support (0.91, 0.75 to 1.11). Data validated by carbon monoxide readings changed the findings for nicotine replacement therapy only, with smoking cessation validated in 6.6% (85/1295) of those receiving nicotine replacement therapy compared to 9.4% (122/1296) who did not receive such therapy (0.67, 0.50). to 0.90).

621,Effect of patient-specific ratings versus conventional guidelines on investigation decisions in angina: the Appropriateness of Referral and Investigation in Angina (ARIA) trial.,"BACKGROUND: Conventional guidelines have limited effect in changing clinician ordering of tests. We attempted to determine the effect of patient-specific ratings versus conventional guidelines on the appropriate investigation of angina. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of 145 physicians who received patient-specific ratings (online message indicating whether the specific vignette was considered appropriate or inappropriate for research, with access to detailed information on how the ratings were derived) and 147 physicians who received conventional guidelines of the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. Physicians made recommendations on 12 web-based patient vignettes before and 12 vignettes after these interventions. The outcome was the proportion of appropriate research decisions as defined by 2 independent expert panels. RESULTS: Decisions about exercise electrocardiography were more appropriate with patient-specific ratings (819/1491 [55%]) compared with conventional guidelines (648/1488 [44%]) (odds ratio [OR], 1, 57""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.82). The effect was stronger for angiography (1274/1595 [80%] with patient-specific scores compared with 1009/1576 [ 64%] with conventional guidelines [OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.90-2.62]. Within-group comparisons confirmed that conventional guidelines had no effect, but that patient-specific ratings significantly changed clinicians' decisions toward appropriate recommendations for exercise electrocardiography (55% vs. 42%; OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.14-3.22) and for angiography (80% vs. a 65%, OR, 2.10, 95% CI, 1.79-2.47).These effects were robust for medical specialty (cardiologists and general practitioners). general) and for vignette characteristics, including older age, female gender, and nonwhite race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Specific patient ratings, unlike conventional guidelines, have changed clinicians' testing behavior and have the potential to reduce variations in practice and increase the appropriate use of research.",1,1,
622,Effect of physician recommendation and patient adherence on colorectal cancer screening rates.,"This study explored: (1) patient characteristics associated with physician recommendation for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and patient adherence to recommendation, and (2) the combined effect of recommendation and compliance in CCR tests, in a broad definition. Data were from the 1999 MA BRFSS and a callback survey of 869 BRFSS participants, age 50 and older. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of recommendation, compliance, and trial. Physician-patient factors were positively associated with recommendation, adherence, and testing. Inadequate health insurance was negatively associated with recommendation (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.78) and evidence (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.38 to 1 ,one). Men were not more likely to be recommended (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.5), but were more likely to adhere (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1, 2 to 2.0) and being tested ( OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9). There were gender differences in the recommendation when considering health measures and risk factors. Research is needed to understand the differences in recommendation and adherence.

623,Effect of self-efficacy and social support on adherence to antihypertensive drugs,"OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: To determine the relationship between poor adherence and self-efficacy or social support after a pharmaceutical intervention. DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials of collaborative physician-pharmacist interventions (6 and 9 months, respectively) to improve blood pressure control. SETTING: Eleven university-affiliated primary care clinics. PATIENTS: Five hundred and eighty-four patients (age 21 to 85 years) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 in the control group. INTERVENTION: Pharmacists provided intensive management of hypertension and medication adherence counseling to patients in the intervention group MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Self-efficacy and social support questionnaires were administered at baseline and end of study Patient adherence was monitored by use of the adherence questionnaire self-reported Morisky Self-reported adherence scores improved significantly in the intervention group control group (p=0.0053) but not in the intervention group, however baseline adherence in both groups was high There were improvements small, but significant, self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not in the intervention group. the control group at the end of the study Social support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of duration of study p participation (9-month vs. 6-month intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mm Hg) compared to the control group (140.8/78.9 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic , p=0.032 for diastolic). CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention. Drug adherence was correlated with self-efficacy, although drug adherence was not significantly improved in the intervention group. The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a result of a function of duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive influence on these measures. Although changes in social support, self-efficacy and medication adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in participants. intervention group compared to the control group. These findings indicate that changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, or social support likely played less of a role in blood pressure outcomes in these studies.",0,0,
624,Effect of telecare management on pain and depression in cancer patients: a randomized trial,"Context Pain and depression are 2 of the most prevalent and treatable cancer-related symptoms, but they often go unrecognized, poorly treated, or both. Objective To determine whether centralized telephone care management coupled with automated symptom monitoring can improve depression and pain in cancer patients. Design, setting, and patients Randomized controlled trial conducted in 16 urban and rural community oncology practices involved in the Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial. Recruitment occurred from March 2006 to August 2008 and follow-up concluded in August 2009. Participating patients had depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score Â¡Ã 10), cancer-related pain (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] worst pain score Â¡Ã 6), or both. Intervention The 202 patients randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the 203 to receive usual care were stratified by symptom type. Patients in the intervention group received centralized telecare management by a team of specialist nurses and physicians along with automated symptom monitoring at home using interactive voice recording or the Internet. Main outcome measures Blinded assessment at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 for depression (20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist [HSCL-20]) and severity of pain (BPI). Results Of the 405 participants enrolled in the study, 131 had depression alone, 96 had pain alone, and 178 had both depression and pain. Of the 274 patients with pain, 137 patients in the intervention group had greater improvements in BPI pain severity over the 12-month trial, either measured as a continuous severity score or as a categorical response to pain (30% decrease in BPI) than the 137 patients in the usual care group (p < 0.001 for both). Similarly, of the 309 patients with depression, the 154 patients in the intervention group had greater improvements in HSCL-20 depression severity over the 12-month trial, either measured as a continuous severity score or as a response. categorical to depression (¡Ã 50% decrease in HSCL) than the 155 patients in the usual care group (P < 0.001 for both).

625,Effect of Telehealth on Quality of Life and Psychological Outcomes Over 12 Months (Whole Systems Demonstrator Telehealth Questionnaire Study): Nested Study of Patient-Reported Outcomes in a Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of second-generation home telehealth on health-related quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms over 12 months in patients with long-term conditions. DESIGN A study of patient-reported outcomes (the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telehealth Questionnaire Study""; baseline n=1573) was nested within a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial of telehealth (the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telehealth Questionnaire Study; baseline n=1573). , n=3230).General practice was unit randomization and telehealth was compared with usual care.Data were collected at baseline, four months (short term), and 12 months (long term). primary intent-to-treat assessed treatment efficacy; multilevel models controlled for clustering by general practice. and a variety of covariates. Analyzes were performed for 759 participants who completed questionnaire measures at all three time points (case cohort complete) and 1201 who completed the baseline assessment plus at least one other assessment (case cohort available).Secondary per-protocol tests tested efi treatment and included 633 and 1108 participants in the full case and available case cohorts, respectively. ion of primary and secondary care through general practices, specialist nurses and hospital clinics in three diverse regions of England (Cornwall, Kent and Newham), with established integrated health and social care systems. PARTICIPANTS Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, or heart failure recruited between May 2008 and December 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Generic health-related quality of life (assessed by physical and mental health component scores of the SF-12, and the EQ-5D), anxiety (assessed by the Brief State-Trait Anxiety Inventory of six items) and depressive symptoms (assessed by the Depression Scale of the Center for Epidemiological Studies of 10 items). RESULTS In intention-to-treat analyses, differences between treatment groups were small and non-significant for all outcomes in the full case (0.480 Ã¢â€°Â¤ P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.904) or case available (0.181 Ã¢â€°Â¤ P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.905) cohorts. The magnitude of the differences between trial arms did not reach the trial-defined minimal clinically important difference (standardized mean difference of 0.3) for any outcome in either cohort at four or 12 months. The per-protocol analyzes replicated the primary analyses; the main effect of the trial arm (telehealth versus usual care) was not significant for any outcome (complete case cohort 0.273 Ã¢â€°Â¤ P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.761; available case cohort 0.145 Ã¢â € °Â¤ P Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.696). CONCLUSIONS Second-generation home telehealth, as implemented in the Comprehensive Systems Demonstrator Evaluation, was neither effective nor efficient when compared to usual care alone. Telehealth did not improve quality of life or psychological outcomes. for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, or heart failure for 12 months. The findings suggest that concerns about the potentially harmful effect of telehealth are unfounded for most patients. TEST RECORD ISRCTN43002091.",0,0,
626,Effect of telephone contact on new suicide attempts in patients discharged from an emergency department: a randomized controlled study,"OBJECTIVE To determine the one-year effects of telephone contact with patients one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for deliberate self-poisoning compared with treatment as usual. DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SCENARIO 13 emergency departments in the north of France. PARTICIPANTS 605 people discharged from an emergency department after a suicide attempt due to deliberate self-intoxication. INTERVENTION The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone one to three months after discharge from an emergency department for suicide attempt to assess the success of the recommended treatment or to adjust treatment. Control patients received their usual treatment, in most cases being returned to their GP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who re-attempted suicide, the number of deaths by suicide, and loss to follow-up at 13-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures were types and number of health care contacts. RESULTS By intention-to-treat, the three groups did not differ significantly in additional suicide attempts, suicide deaths, or losses to follow-up: contact at 1 month (intervention 23% (34/147) versus controls 30% (93/312), difference 7%, 95% confidence interval - 2% to 15%), three months (25% (36/146) vs. 30%, difference 5%, -4% to 14%). Participants contacted at 1 month were less likely to report a new suicide attempt at follow-up (12% vs. 22% in the control group, difference 10%, 2% to 18%). CONCLUSION Contacting people by phone one month after being discharged from an emergency department for deliberate poisoning can help reduce the number of suicide attempts for one year.",0,0,
627,Effect of training on the adoption of nutrition-related activities for cancer prevention by primary care clinics: results of a randomized controlled study,"OBJECTIVE: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed a manual to guide primary care practices in structuring their office environment and routine visits to improve nutritional assessment, counseling/referral, and monitoring for cancer prevention. Adoption of the manual's recommendations by primary care practices was assessed by examining two strategies: training clinicians on how to implement the manual's recommendations versus simply mailing the manual. This article reports the results of a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of these two strategies. DESIGN: A three-arm randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Independent primary care physician practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. INTERVENTION: Each study practice was randomly assigned to one of three groups. Training group practices were invited to send a member of their chosen practice to a 3-hour ""train the trainer"" workshop, manual-only group practices received the nutrition manual, and control received no intervention. For training group practices, training was provided on the four main components of the nutrition manual: how to organize the office environment to support activities related to nutrition for cancer prevention; how to assess patient compliance with NCI dietary guidelines; how to provide dietary advice/referral;"" and how to implement a patient tracking system to help patients make changes in their nutrition-related behaviors. MEASUREMENTS: Primary study outcomes were derived from two assessment instruments. The instrument observation documented the tools and procedures recommended by the nutrition manual and adopted in patient charts and in the office environment Structured face-to-face interview assessed physician- and staff-reported nutrition-related activities that reflected the recommendations in the nutrition manual. Data from these two instruments were used to construct four adherence scores corresponding to the areas: practice organization, nutritional assessment, nutritional counseling/referral, and patient follow-up. MAIN RESULTS: Adoption of the recommendations of the manual was higher among practices in the training group, as reflected by their higher adherence scores. They set up their practice (p = 0.005) and rated their patients regarding their eating habits (p = 0.046) significantly closer to the nutrition manual recommendations than the practices in the manual-only group. However, despite being the highest in compliance, the training group practices only 54.9% adhered to the manual's recommendations regarding nutritional counseling/referral, and 28.5% adhered to their recommendations on organization of the office, 23.5% adhered to their recommendations on nutritional evaluation and 14.6% adhered to their recommendations for patient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices exposed to the nutrition manual in a training session adopted more of the manual's recommendations. Specifically, practices invited to the training were more likely to conduct nutritional screenings and to structure their office environment to be conducive to providing nutrition-related services for cancer prevention. The impact of training was modest and not statistically significant for nutrition advice/referral or patient follow-up, which are important for achieving long-term dietary changes in patients. The low overall adherence scores for nutrition-related activities demonstrate that there is a lot of room for improvement among the practices in the training group.",0,0,

632,Effective weight control practice: a review of the evidence for lifestyle intervention,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the existence of guidelines for the management of obesity, uncertainty persists about which interventions constitute an effective practice. This uncertainty could act as a barrier for busy healthcare professionals, who may lack the time and expertise to fully assess the vast amount of literature that is published each year on obesity management. Therefore, the objectives of this review were to synthesize the available evidence, determine the most effective and promising practices for the management of obesity in adults, using an established methodology, and present this information according to its quality. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This synthesis review was conducted from January 2009. A detailed search of relevant databases was performed up to September 2010. The most effective and promising practices were defined using the Initiative Methodology Background Paper of Canadian best practices, with systematic reviews (with/without meta-analysis). ) as the most rigorous methodology to develop recommendations that were considered more effective (level 1), and non-systematic reviews to develop recommendations that were considered more promising (level 2). The literature was reviewed and classified into these two levels of rigor, supplemented by primary studies to further refine the recommendations. RESULTS: Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses was categorized into three intervention themes or context areas, into which more specific, more effective, and/or promising practice recommendations could be nested. These intervention themes were (1) multi-component targeted interventions for weight control, (2) dietary manipulation strategies, and (3) delivery of weight control interventions, including the roles of health professionals and the method of delivery. Specific recommendations accompanied each topic. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the value of multicomponent interventions that are delivered over the long term and reinforces the role of health professionals. The findings will help inform evidence-based practice for health professionals involved in obesity prevention and control.",0,0,

OUTCOMES A population-wide program in England and Wales (around 50 million people) which reduced cardiovascular events by just 1% would save the health service worth at least £30 million (£34 million; $48 million) a year compared to no additional intervention Reducing mean cholesterol concentrations or blood pressure levels in the population by 5% (as has already been achieved with similar interventions in some other countries) would result in annual savings of at least 80 £100 million to £100 million Legislation or other measures to reduce dietary salt intake a at 3 g/day (current average intake approximately 8.5 g/day) would prevent approximately 30,000 cardiovascular events, saving at least £40 million per year. Legislation to reduce intake of industrial trans fatty acids by around 0.5% of total energy content could gain around 570,000 life years and generate NHS savings of at least £230m a year. CONCLUSIONS Any intervention that achieved even a modest population-wide reduction in any major cardiovascular risk factor would result in net cost savings to the NHS, in addition to improving health. Given the conservative assumptions used in this model, the true benefits would likely be higher.",0,0,
634,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an exposure-based return-to-work program for patients on sick leave due to common mental disorders: cluster randomized controlled trial design,"BACKGROUND: To reduce the length of sick leave and productivity loss due to common mental disorders (CMDs), we developed a return-to-work program to be provided by occupational physicians (OPs) based on the principles of in vivo exposure ( RTW). -E program). This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this program by comparing it with usual care (CAU). The three research questions we have are: 1) Is a RTW-E program more effective in reducing sick leave for employees with common mental disorders, compared to usual care? 2) Is an RTW-E program more effective in reducing sick leave for employees with anxiety disorders compared to employees with other common mental disorders? 3) From a societal perspective, is an RTW-E program cost-effective compared to usual care? METHODS/DESIGN: This study was designed as a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial with one year of follow-up and randomization at the OP level. We are aiming for 60 POs to include 200 patients. Patients in the intervention group received the RTW-E program. Patients in the control group received usual care. Eligible patients had been on sick leave due to common mental disorders for at least two weeks and no more than eight weeks. As primary outcome measures, we calculated time to full return to work and length of sick leave. Secondary outcome measures were time to partial return to work, sick leave prevalence rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months follow-up, and symptom scores for distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and fatigue""; work capacity; perceived working conditions; self-efficacy for return to work; coping behavior; avoidance behavior; patient satisfaction;"" and work adaptations. As process measures, we used rates of intervention compliance in the intervention group and employee-supervisor communication in both groups. The economic costs were calculated from a social perspective. Total costs consisted of the costs of consuming medical care, the costs of lost production due to sick leave and reduced productivity, and out-of-pocket expenses for patients to travel to their PO. DISCUSSION: The results will be published in 2009. The strengths and weaknesses of the study protocol are discussed. TEST REGISTRATION: ISRCTN72643128.",0,0,
635,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of knowledge transfer and behavior modification interventions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: the INDICA study: a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease whose health outcomes are related to the decision-making of patients and health professionals. The Intervention in Diabetes in the Canary Islands study (INDICA study) aims to evaluate the efficacy and profitability of educational interventions supported by new technological decision-making tools for patients with type 2 diabetes and primary care professionals in the Canary Islands. Methods/Design The INDICA study is a multicenter, community-based, open-label, controlled clinical trial with cluster random assignment to one of three interventions or usual care. The setting is primary care where doctors and nurses are invited to participate. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, 18 to 65 years of age and regular mobile phone users were randomly selected. Patients with severe comorbidities were excluded. Clusters are primary health care practices with enough professionals and places available to provide the intervention. The calculated sample size was 2,300 patients. Group 1 patients receive an eight-session educational group program every 3 months led by trained nurses and monitored through records and a web-based platform and personalized semi-automated SMS for ongoing support. Group 2 primary care professionals are receiving a brief educational program to update their diabetes knowledge, including a decision support tool integrated into the electronic medical record and a monthly patient outcome feedback report . Group 3 is receiving a combination of patient and professional interventions. The primary end point is the change in HbA1c over 2 years. Secondary endpoints are cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, quality of life, psychological outcomes, knowledge of diabetes, and health care utilization. Data is collected from interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations, and records. Generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements will be used to analyze changes in the results. The cost-effectiveness analysis, from a health services perspective, involves direct medical costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and two periods, an Â¡Â®within trialÂ¡Â¯ period and a Markov model of by lifetime. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes are planned.

637,Effectiveness of a Behavioral Intervention to Prevent Excessive Weight Gain During Childhood (The Baby Milk Trial): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Childhood is a period of rapid growth and habit formation and thus could be a critical period for obesity prevention. Excessive weight gain during infancy is associated with later obesity, and formula-fed babies are more likely to gain weight compared to breastfed babies. The primary outcome of the trial is a change in weight standard deviation score from birth to one year. METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 650 to 700 parents who introduce formula feeding within 14 weeks of their infant's birth for a single (rater) blind, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial. The focus of the intervention is the caregiver (usually the mother), and the focus of the primary outcome is the baby. The intervention group will receive the behavioral intervention, which aims to reduce formula intake, promote responsive feeding and healthy weaning, and prevent excess weight gain during infancy. The intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and action planning ('implementation intentions'). It consists of three components: (1) a motivation component to strengthen parents' motivation to follow infant formula feeding guidelines, (2) an action planning component to help translate motivation into action, and ( 3) a coping planning component to help parents. cope with difficult situations. It will be delivered by trained facilitators (research nurses) over 6 months through three face-to-face contacts, two telephone contacts, and written materials. The control group will have the same number of contacts with the facilitators and general topics on nutrition will be discussed. Anthropometric outcomes will be measured by trained research personnel, blinded to group assignment, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after standard operating procedures. Validated questionnaires will assess milk intake, temperament, appetite, sleep, maternal quality of life, and maternal psychological factors. A 4-day food diary will be completed at 8 months. DISCUSSION: The results of the trial will help inform infant feeding guidelines and understand the links between infant feeding, behavior, appetite, and growth. TEST LOG: ISRTCN20814693 .

638,Efficacy of a combined strategy to improve therapeutic compliance and degree of control in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: In subjects with hypercholesterolemia, cholesterol values remain above reference levels. One of the limiting factors for the achievement of the objectives in these patients is the lack of therapeutic adherence. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve the control of hypercholesterolemic patients, consisting of a combined strategy that would include the delivery of printed information, treatment compliance control cards and the sending of text messages as complementary measures in support of the intervention in the general practitioner's office. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial of parallel groups will be carried out in family medicine outpatient clinics of eight health centers in three Autonomous Communities of Spain, covering a total of 358 subjects aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Patients in the intervention group will be provided with printed material with information on the disease and its management, text messages to mobile phones with summaries of the guidelines, reminders of upcoming appointments and/or scheduling of new appointments in case of non-attendance, and self-report cards to check compliance with the recommendations. Both groups -intervention and control- will receive routine recommendations from their doctors in accordance with current European clinical practice guidelines for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk management. Regarding the measurements to be made, the main variable is the proportion of subjects who reach the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels over a 24-month follow-up period. The secondary variables are the following: adherence to lifestyle recommendations and adherence to pharmacological treatment”; variation of lipid profiles and levels of cardiovascular risk; occurrence of cardiovascular events; physical activity; food consumption; smoking; anthropometric measures; blood pressure; health problems ; use of lipid-lowering agents; sociodemographic data; beliefs and expectations about preventive recommendations;"" and degree of satisfaction with the combined strategy.

639,Effectiveness of a prospective physician self-audit transfusion monitoring system.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to search for a more effective transfusion monitoring system than the existing retrospective peer review system. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This investigation used a control, preintervention, and postintervention study design to assess the effectiveness of a prospective physician self-audit transfusion monitoring system that functioned without the direct involvement of transfusion service physicians. This research also evaluated the effectiveness of issuing physicians with a memorandum of transfusion guidelines. Three process indicators were used to assess physician behavior at various stages of the blood ordering process: 1) the number of crossmatches ordered per admission, 2) the ratio of transfusion to crossmatch, and 3) the number of units of blood returned to the hospital. laboratory after physician self-audit. The study used two outcome measures to reflect overall blood utilization: 1) the percentage of patients receiving red blood cell transfusions and 2) the number of units of blood transfused per recipient each month. RESULTS: The prospective physician self-audit system implemented at the study hospital did not reverse physicians' transfusion decisions, and the process of issuing physicians with a memorandum of transfusion guidelines at the control hospital failed to reduce transfusion use. of blood. However, a transient reduction in blood utilization was observed at the study hospital. CONCLUSION: The reduction was hypothesized to be due to a Hawthorne effect, in which observed behavior is affected by the subject's awareness of the research study.",0,1,
640,Efficacy of academic detail to optimize medication prescription behavior of family doctors,"PURPOSE: To synthesize current knowledge on the effectiveness and effect size of Academic Detailing (AD), as a stand-alone intervention, in modifying the medication prescribing behavior of family physicians (FPs) in primary care settings.

641,Efficacy of an audible reminder on hand hygiene compliance,"Multimodal interventions aim to improve adherence to hand hygiene guidelines by healthcare workers. Visitors are not the main target, but they can spread epidemic infections. Effective interventions that improve visitor adherence to hand hygiene guidelines are needed to prevent transmission of epidemic infections to or from healthcare settings. Methods An audible hand hygiene reminder activated by an electronic motion sensor was installed at hospital ward entrances. An 8-month pre- and post-intervention study was conducted to measure the adherence of visitors and hospital staff to hand hygiene guidelines. Results General adherence to hand hygiene increased from 7.6% to 49.9% (p < 0.001). Visitor and non-clinical staff adherence increased immediately from 10.6% to 63.7% and from 5.3% to 34.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). The adherence of doctors, nurses and physical therapists gradually increased from 4.5% to 38.3%, from 5.4% to 43.4% and from 8.7% to 49.5%, respectively (p < 0.001). Improved adherence was maintained among visitors and clinical staff (P < 0.001), but not among non-clinical staff (P = 0.341). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic motion sensor activated sound reminder improved and maintained immediate and significant adherence of hospital visitors and clinical staff to hand hygiene guidelines. This is an effective addition to multimodal hand hygiene interventions and can help control epidemic infections.",0,1,

Electronic order sets have shown promise as a means of integrating directory information with electronic order entry systems and facilitating safer and more efficient care. Objective The objective was to study the efficacy of a computer-based antibacterial order in increasing the proportion of patients who had antibacterial wound prophylaxis discontinued in the appropriate time frame. Design The authors performed a quasi-experimental analysis of interrupted time series over an 8-month study period with the implementation of a computer-based ordering system designed to prevent excessive duration of antibacterial surgical prophylaxis. Measurement The primary outcome was the proportion of surgeries with antibacterials discontinued in the appropriate time frame. In addition, the percentage of surgeries after implementation of the electronic intervention with graphic documentation of infection among surgeries in which the prescriber indicated that the reason for antibacterial therapy was treatment was evaluated. Results The computerized order intervention significantly improved the proportion of surgeries with timely discontinuation of antibacterials from 38.8% to 55.7% (p<0.001) in the intervention hospital, while the control hospital remained at 56-57 % (p=0.006 for the difference between treated and control hospitals). In surgeries after implementation of the intervention where a prescriber indicated that the reason for antibacterial therapy was treatment, the prevalence of infection documented in the chart was only 14%.

644,Efficacy of an intervention to improve adherence to occupational physicians' guidelines on duration of sickness absence in workers with common mental disorders: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Purpose Evidence-based guidelines in occupational health care improve the quality of care and can reduce the length of sickness absence. However, adherence to the guidance of occupational physicians (OPs) is limited. Based on the literature on guideline implementation, an intervention was developed that was shown to effectively improve self-reported adherence in POs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this intervention leads to earlier return to work (RTW) in workers with common mental disorders (CMD). Methods In a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial, 66 OPs were randomized. The trial included 3,379 workers, with 1,493 in the intervention group and 1,886 in the control group. Outcome measures were: time to full RTW, time to first RTW, and total hours of sickness absence. Cox regression analyzes and generalized linear mixed model analyzes were used for evaluations. Results The median time to RTW was 154 days among the 3228 workers with CMD. There was no significant difference in (time to) full RTW between intervention and control group HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.15) or for first RTW HR 0.96 ( 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.15). The mean total hours of sickness absence was 478 h in the intervention group and 483 h in the control group. Conclusions Intervention to improve adherence to OP guidelines did not lead to earlier RTW in OP-guided CMD workers. Possible explanations are remaining external barriers to guideline use, and that perceived guideline adherence might not represent actual guideline adherence and better care.

645,Efficacy of brief training in cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques for palliative care professionals,"We describe training in CBT techniques for 20 palliative care professionals delivered as the equivalent of 12 days of teaching plus skill-building supervision over a six-month period. Audiotapes of trainees' interactions with patients during their regular work were scored using a specially designed 'Cognitive First Aid' (CFARS) rating scale. The CFARS was highly internally consistent (Cronbach's Alpha 0.93) and inter-rater reliability was high. Trainees showed a significant increase in CBT skills proficiency over six months (p = 0.001). After initial training, half of the trainees were randomly assigned to discontinue supervision"";"" their measured CBT skill decreased as did their self-reported confidence when reassessed six months later, while those who continued to be supervised gained more skill and maintained confidence (p = 0.007). Palliative care professionals can be trained in CBT skills through a short, simple training course and supportive supervision for skill development. These skills are consistent with national guidelines on providing psychological support to patients at all stages of cancer. Supervision is necessary to ensure the maintenance of skills and the confidence to use them.",0,0,
646,Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for the treatment of dementia: evidence review for a clinical practice guideline,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of the 5 US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug therapies for dementias in achieving clinically relevant improvements is unclear. Purpose: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and the neuropeptide-modifying agent memantine in achieving clinically relevant improvements, primarily in cognition, global function, behavior, and quality of life. of life, for patients with dementia. Data sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, AgeLine, and PsycINFO from January 1986 to November 2006. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials in English if they evaluated pharmacological agents for adults diagnosed with dementia, did not use a crossover design, and had a quality score of at least 3 on the Jadad scale. Data Extraction: Data on study characteristics and outcomes, including adverse events, were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated and data combined where appropriate. Data synthesis: 96 publications representing 59 unique studies were eligible for this review. Both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine had consistent effects in the cognition and global assessment domains, but summary estimates showed small effect sizes. Outcomes in the behavior and quality of life domains were assessed less frequently and showed less consistent effects. Most studies were of short duration (6 months), which limited their ability to detect delayed onset or progression of dementia. Three studies directly compared different cholinesterase inhibitors and found no difference in cognition and behaviour. Limitations: Limitations of the available studies included short duration, inclusion of only patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, poor reporting of adverse events, lack of clear definitions for statistical significance, limited assessment of behavior and study results. quality of life and limited direct outcomes. comparison of different treatments. Conclusions: Treatment of dementia with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may result in statistically significant but clinically marginal improvement in measures of cognition and global assessment of dementia.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of a collaborative care model to improve the quality of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Controlled clinical trial of 153 older adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers who were randomly assigned by a physician to receive collaborative care management (n = 84) or augmented usual care (n = 69) in practices care within 2 US University Affiliated Health Care Systems from January 2002 through August 2004. Eligible patients (identified through screening or medical records) met diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's and had a self-identified caregiver. INTERVENTION: Intervention patients received 1 year of care management by an interdisciplinary team led by an advanced practice nurse working with the patient's family caregiver and integrated within primary care. The team used standard protocols to initiate treatment and identify, monitor, and treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, emphasizing non-pharmacological management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months. Secondary outcomes included the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), cognition, activities of daily living, resource use, and caregiver depression severity. RESULTS: Initiated by caregiver reports, 89% of intervention patients activated at least 1 protocol for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia with a mean of 4 per patient out of a total of 8 possible protocols. Intervention patients were more likely to receive cholinesterase inhibitors (79.8% vs. 55.1%""; p=0.002) and antidepressants (45.2% vs. 27.5%; p=0.03 Intervention patients had significantly fewer behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia as measured by NPI total score at 12 months (mean difference, -5.6; P = .01) and at 18 months (mean difference, -5.6). mean, -5.4; P = .01).Intervention caregivers also reported significant improvements in NPI caregiver-measured distress at 12 months;"" at 18 months, caregivers showed improvement in depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.

651,Effectiveness of guideline-based care by occupational physicians on the return to work of workers with common mental disorders: a cluster randomized controlled trial design.,"BACKGROUND: Sick absenteeism due to common mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder) is a problem in many Western countries. Long-term sickness absenteeism generates substantial social and financial costs. For workers with common mental disorders, the costs of sick leave are much higher than the medical costs. In the Netherlands, a practical guide was developed that promotes an activating approach of the occupational doctor to establish a faster return to work by improving the problem-solving capacity of workers, especially in relation to their work environment. Studies on this guideline indicate a promising association between guideline compliance and shorter duration of sick leave, but also minimal adherence to the guideline by occupational physicians. Therefore, this study assesses the effect of guideline-based care on the full return to work of workers who are on sick list due to common mental disorders. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial randomized at the occupational physician level. For one year, occupational physicians in the intervention group receive innovative training to improve their guideline-based care, while occupational physicians in the control group provide usual care. A total of 232 workers, patients registered for common mental disorders and advised by the participating occupational doctors will be included. Data are collected through the occupational health service registry system and through questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is the time to full return to work. Secondary outcomes are partial return to work, total number of sick days, symptoms, and work ability. Personal and occupational characteristics are the prognostic measures. Additional measures are coping, self-efficacy, remoralization, personal experiences, satisfaction with occupational physician consultations and supervisor contact, supervisor experiences and behavior, and degree of adherence to guidelines . DISCUSSION: If the results show that guideline-based care does indeed lead to a faster and more sustainable return to work, this study will help reduce personal, social, and financial costs.

Design A prospective, randomized, controlled bilevel clinical trial of MNT on metabolic control in people newly diagnosed with or currently being treated for NIDDM was conducted at diabetes centers in three states (Minnesota, Florida, and Colorado). BC consisted of a single visit with a dietitian""; PGC involved an initial visit with a dietitian followed by two visits during the first 6 weeks of the study period. Data were collected at study entry and at 3 and 6 months. Subjects Outcomes are reported for 179 men and women aged 38 to 76 years: 85 randomized to BC and 94 to PGC This represents 72% of the 247 subjects enrolled Another 62 adults with NIDDM at one site who had no contact with a dietician were identified as a non-randomized comparison group. Outcomes Medical outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum lipid levels. Clinical outcomes included weight, body mass index, waist-to-body ratio. hip and changes in medical status Statistical analysis The initial analysis of the discrete variables was performed using the ?2 statistic with Yates correction The initial analysis of the conti nuas was performed by analysis of variance. Changes in variables between time periods were analyzed by paired t-test and comparisons between groups were analyzed by t-test for independent groups. Results At 6 months, PGC resulted in significant improvements in blood glucose control as indicated by FPG and HbA1c levels and BC resulted in significant improvements in HbA1c level. Participants assigned to the PGC group had a mean FPG level at 6 months that was 10.5% lower than the level at admission, and those in the BC group had a 5.3% lower value. Among subjects who had diabetes for more than 6 months, those who received PGC had a significantly better HbA1c level at 3 months compared to those who received BC. The comparison group showed no improvement in glycemic control over a comparable 6 months. PGC subjects had significant improvements in cholesterol values at 6 months, and subjects in the PGC and BC groups had significant weight loss. Conclusions MNT provided by dieticians resulted in significant improvements in medical and clinical outcomes in the BC and PGC groups and is beneficial for people with NIDDM. People with a duration of diabetes of more than 6 months tended to improve with PGC than with BC. Due to the upward trend in glucose levels after 3 months, continued MNT by dieticians is important for long-term metabolic control. J Am Diet Association. 1995;"" 95:1009-1017.",0,1,
653,Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in improving lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia attended by general practitioners: Dislip-EM study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The non-pharmacological approach to cholesterol control in patients with hyperlipidemia is based on the promotion of a healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, to help patients change their habits, it is essential to identify the most effective approach. Much effort has been devoted to explaining changes or adherence to specific health behaviors. Such efforts have resulted in the development of theories that have been applied in prevention campaigns and that include brief advice and counseling services. In this context, Motivational Interviewing has been shown to be effective in changing health behaviors in specific cases. However, more robust evidence is needed on the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in the treatment of chronic pathologies -such as dyslipidemia- in patients seen by general practitioners. This article describes a protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of MI compared to general practice (brief advice), with the aim of improving control of lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia attended by a general practitioner. METHODS/DESIGN: An open, parallel, two-arm, multicenter, cluster, controlled, randomized clinical trial will be conducted. A total of 48-50 general practitioners from 35 public primary care centers in Spain will be randomized and will recruit 436 patients with dyslipidemia. They will carry out an intervention based either on the Motivational Interview or on the usual brief advice. After an initial assessment, follow-ups will be carried out at 2, 4, 8 and 12 months. Primary outcomes are lipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and cardiovascular risk. The study will assess the degree of improvement in diet and physical activity, weight loss in overweight patients, and adherence to treatment guidelines. DISCUSSION: Motivational interviewing skills are the main strategies used by general practitioners to treat their patients. Having cheap, simple, effective and applicable techniques is essential for primary care professionals to help their patients change their lifestyle and improve their health. This study will provide scientific evidence on the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing, and will be carried out under strict control over the data collected, ensuring the maintenance of therapeutic integrity.

654,Effectiveness of motivational interviewing in patients with dyslipidemia: a cluster randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Getting people to change their habits is known to be challenging. It is crucial to identify the most effective approach that general practitioners (GPs) should use to help their patients change unhealthy habits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention based on Motivational Interviewing performed by general practitioners to improve lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia, compared to standard care. METHODS: Multicentre, controlled, randomized, cluster trial with two parallel arms with a follow-up of 12 months carried out in 25 community health centers in Spain. The trial included 38 general practitioners and 227 primary care patients with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. Physicians performed an intervention based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) or routine practice. Lipid levels were measured and the degree of control was analyzed according to the criteria of the clinical guidelines. RESULTS: 107 were assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) and 120 to the Control Group (CG). An overall improvement was achieved in total cholesterol levels (Mean Difference -MD- = -19.60""; 95% CI: -15.33 to -23.87 mg/dl; p < 0.001), cholesterol levels LDL (MD = -13.78; 95% CI: -9.77 to -17.79 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MD = -19.14; 95% CI: -11.29 to - 26.99 mg/dl; p < 0.001), no differences were found between both groups.However, when we evaluated the degree of lipid control by combining the parameters cholesterol <200mg/dl and LDL cholesterol <130mg/dl, it was observed that a higher percentage of patients achieved target figures in the EG compared to the CG (13.1% vs. 5.0%; adjusted OR = 5.77, 95% CI: 1.67-19.91) CONCLUSION: A approach based on Motivational Interviewing conducted by Primary Care physicians aimed at patients with dyslipidemia, achieved a significant reduction in all lipid parameters, cardiovascular risk, weight reduction and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, similar to that obtained with the usual intervention and top and n the proportion of pa patients achieving combined targets for lipid control and physical exercise level.

655,Efficacy of multicomponent interventions in primary health care settings to promote continued smoking cessation in adults: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to evaluate multicomponent/complex primary care (PC) interventions to determine their effectiveness in continued abstinence from smoking in adult smokers. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials was conducted. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: Selected studies met the following criteria: evaluated the effects of a multicomponent/complex intervention (with 2 or more intervention components) in achieving at least 6 months of abstinence in adult smokers visiting a PC , biochemical confirmation of abstinence, Intention-to-treat analysis and results published in English/Spanish. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA statement to report the review. The following data sources were searched: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus (from inception to February 2014), 3 key journals, and a tobacco research newsletter. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklists were used to assess methodological quality. Selection, evaluation, and data extraction were performed independently, using a peer review approach. Due to the heterogeneity of the interventions in the included studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: Of 1,147 identified references, 9 studies were selected (10,204 participants, up to 48-month follow-up, acceptable methodological quality). The methodologies used were mainly individual or group sessions, telephone conversations, brochures or kits to stop smoking, medications and economic incentives for doctors and free medications for smokers. Complex interventions achieved long-term continuous abstinence ranging from 7% to 40%. Behavioral interventions were effective and had a dose-response effect. Both nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion therapy were safe and effective, with no differences observed. CONCLUSIONS: Multicomponent/complex interventions in PC are effective and safe, and appear to achieve greater long-term continuous smoking cessation than usual care and advice alone. The selected studies were heterogeneous and some had significant losses to follow up. Our results show that smoking interventions should include more than one component and strong patient follow-up to maximize outcomes.",0,0,
656,Efficacy of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders,"BACKGROUND: Nurses generally provide care for people with personality disorders on a day-to-day basis. Consequently, it is important to establish how effective nursing interventions are for people with personality disorders, both in terms of general management and more specific therapeutic approaches. These are also topics of current political and professional debate. However, the crucial question for service planners, providers and commissioners is: What research evidence is there about effectiveness? There is also a need to determine what additional research is needed to evaluate behavior management or modification programs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to report a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders, whether performed by nurses alone or in combination with other health professionals. METHOD: The review was carried out in accordance with the UK Health Service National Center for Review and Dissemination guidelines. Literature was identified from electronic database searches, footnote searches, journal hand searching, and contact with study authors. A narrative synthesis was performed in relation to the study design, the participants and the type of intervention. FINDINGS: Eighteen separate studies were included in the review: four randomized controlled trials, four nonrandomized controlled trials, seven before and after studies, and three case studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a weak evidence base for what constitutes an effective nursing intervention with people with personality disorders. There is stronger evidence from mixed discipline intervention studies than from nursing-only intervention studies. Studies of interventions based on psychological approaches show greater improvements in outcomes than studies of nursing management.",0,0,
657,Effectiveness of pharmaceutical care for patients with reactive airway disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context It is not known whether patient outcomes are improved by effective pharmacist-patient interactions. Objective To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care program for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized controlled trial conducted at 36 community pharmacies in Indianapolis, Indiana. We enrolled 1,113 participants with active COPD or asthma from July 1998 through December 1999. Outcomes were assessed in 947 (85.1%) participants at 6 months and 898 (80.7%) at 12 months. Interventions The pharmacist care program (n = 447) provided pharmacists with recent patient-specific clinical data (peak expiratory flow rates [PEFR], emergency department [ED] visits, hospitalizations, and medication adherence), training, personalized patient education materials and resources to facilitate program implementation. The PEFR monitoring control group (n = 363) received a peak flow meter, instructions on its use, and monthly calls to obtain PEFR. However, PEFR data was not provided to the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group (n = 303) did not receive peak flow meters or instructions on their use""; PEFR rates were not obtained during monthly telephone interviews. Pharmacists in both control groups had a session training but did not receive medication components MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Peak expiratory flow rates, breathing-related hospital or emergency department visits, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), medication adherence, and patient satisfaction Results At 12 months, patients who received pharmaceutical care had significantly higher peak flow rates than the usual care group (P = 0.02) but not than PEFR monitoring controls (P = 0.28). there were significant differences between groups in medication adherence or HRQoL Patients with asthma who received pharmaceutical care tu they saw significantly more symptoms related to breathing. emergency department or hospital visits than the usual care group (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-2.63; P < .001). Patients who received pharmaceutical care were more satisfied with their pharmacist than the usual care group (p = 0.03) and the PEFR control group (p = 0.001) and were more satisfied with their medical care than the regular care group. usual only at 6 months (p = 0.01). Despite ample opportunities to implement the program, pharmacists accessed patient-specific data only about half the time and documented actions about half the time records were accessed. Conclusions This pharmaceutical care program increased patients' PEFR compared with usual care, but provided little benefit compared with peak flow monitoring alone. Pharmaceutical care increased patient satisfaction, but also increased the amount of respiration-related medical care requested.",0,1,
658,Effectiveness of physical therapy for patients with neck pain: an individualized approach using a clinical decision-making algorithm.,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an individualized physiotherapy intervention in the treatment of neck pain based on a clinical reasoning algorithm. Treatment efficacy was examined by assessing changes in impairment, physical performance, and disability in response to intervention. Design: A treatment group of 30 patients with neck pain completed physiotherapy treatment. The convenience control group consisted of a cohort of 27 subjects who also had neck pain but did not receive treatment for various reasons. There were no significant differences between groups in demographic data and baseline test scores for outcome measures. A non-equivalent, pretest-posttest, quasi-experimental control group design was used. A physical therapist provided an eclectic intervention to the treatment group based on a clinical decision-making algorithm. Treatment outcome measures included the following five dependent variables: cervical range of motion, numerical pain index, time-weighted overhead resistance, the supine head flexion resistance test, and the patient-specific functionality. Both the treatment and control groups completed baseline and follow-up examinations, with an average duration of 4 weeks between tests. Results: Five mixed analyzes of variance with follow-up tests showed a significant difference for all outcome measures in the treatment group compared to the control group. After an average of 4 weeks of physical therapy intervention, patients in the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant increases in cervical range of motion, decreases in pain, increases in physical performance measures, and decreases in level of disability. The control group showed no difference in the five outcome variables between baseline and follow-up test scores. Conclusions: This study outlined algorithm-based clinical reasoning strategies to assess and treat patients with neck pain. The algorithm can help clinicians classify patients with cervical pain into clinical patterns and provides pattern-specific guidelines for physiotherapy interventions. An organized and specific physiotherapy program was effective in improving the condition of patients with neck pain.",0,1,
659,Effectiveness of physical therapy exercise after knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of physical therapy exercise after elective primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis.

Manual Searches: Physiotherapy, Physiotherapy, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery Conference Proceedings (Great Britain). Review methods Randomized controlled trials were reviewed if they included a physical therapy exercise intervention compared to usual or standard physical therapy care, or if they compared two types of exercise physical therapy interventions that met the review criteria, after discharge. inpatient after elective primary total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. OUTCOME MEASURES Functional activities of daily living, walking, quality of life, muscle strength, and range of motion at the knee joint. The quality of the trials was extensively assessed. Narrative synthesis plus meta-analysis with fixed effect models, weighted mean differences, standardized effect sizes, and tests for heterogeneity. RESULTS Six trials were identified, five of which were suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses. There was a small to moderate standardized effect size (0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.58) in favor of functional exercise for function three to four months postoperatively. There were also small to moderate weighted mean differences of 2.9 (0.61 to 5.2) for joint range of motion and 1.66 (-1 to 4.3) for quality of life in favor of functional exercise three four months after the operation. The benefits of the treatment were no longer evident at one year. CONCLUSIONS Interventions including functional physical therapy exercises after discharge result in short-term benefit after elective primary total knee arthroplasty. Effect sizes are small to moderate, with no long-term benefit.",0,0,
660,Efficacy of provider incentives in reducing anemia in rural China: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVES To test the impact of provider performance pay for anemia reduction in rural China. DESIGN A cluster-randomized trial of information, subsidies, and incentives for school principals to reduce anemia among their students. Interviewers and study participants were not informed of study arm assignment. SETTING 72 randomly selected rural primary schools in northwestern China. PARTICIPANTS 3,553 fourth and fifth grade students from 9 to 11 years old. All fourth and fifth grade students from the sample schools participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS The schools in the sample were randomly assigned to a control group, without intervention, or to one of three treatment arms: (a) an information arm, in which principals received information about anemia; (b) a subsidy arm, in which principals received unconditional subsidies and information;"" and (c) an incentive arm, in which principals received information, subsidies, and financial incentives to reduce anemia among students. Twenty-seven schools were assigned to the control arm (1816 students at baseline, 1623 at endpoint), 15 were assigned to the information arm (659 students at baseline, 596 at endpoint), 15 to the subsidy (726 students at baseline, 667 at end) and 15 to the incentive group (743 students at start, 667 at end) MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Student hemoglobin concentrations RESULTS Mean hemoglobin concentration of students increased 1.5 g/L (95% CI -1.1 to 4.1) in information schools, 0.8 g/L (-1.8 to 3.3) in charter schools, and 2.4 g/L (0 to 4.9) in incentive schools schools compared to co group control. This increase in hemoglobin corresponded to a reduction in the prevalence of anemia (Hb <115 g/L) of 24% in the incentive schools. Interactions with preexisting incentives for principals to achieve good academic performance led to substantially larger gains in the information and incentive arms: when combined with incentives for good academic performance, the associated effects on student hemoglobin concentration were 9.8 g/L (4.1 to 15.5) higher in information schools and 8.6 g/L (2.1 to 15.1) higher in incentive schools. CONCLUSIONS Financial incentives to improve health were modestly effective. Understanding the interactions with other pre-existing motives and incentives is critical.

661,Efficacy of Screening and Brief Intervention for Alcohol in Primary Care (SIPS Trial): Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of different brief intervention strategies to reduce hazardous or harmful drinking in primary care. The hypothesis was that a more intensive intervention would result in a greater reduction in hazardous or harmful drinking. DESIGN Pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING Primary care practices in the North East and South East of England and in London. PARTICIPANTS 3,562 patients aged 18 years or older who regularly attended primary care, of whom 2,991 (84.0%) were eligible to participate in the trial: 900 (30.1%) tested positive for hazardous or harmful use and 756 (84.0%) received a brief intervention. The sample was predominantly male (62%) and white (92%), and 34% were current smokers. INTERVENTIONS Practices were randomized to three interventions, each building on the previous one: a control group with a patient information booklet, five minutes of brief structured advice, and 20 minutes of brief style advice. of life. Handout of the patient insert and brief advice occurred directly after screening and brief lifestyle advice at a later consultation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was patients' self-reported hazardous or harmful drinking status measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at six months. A negative AUDIT result (score <8) indicated that alcohol use is neither dangerous nor harmful. Secondary outcomes were a negative AUDIT result at 12 months, experience of alcohol-related problems (alcohol problems questionnaire), health utility (EQ-5D), service utilization, and staff motivation. patients to change drinking behavior (readiness to change) as measured by a modified readiness rule. RESULTS Patient follow-up rates were 83% at six months (n=644) and 79% at 12 months (n=617). At both time points, an intention-to-treat analysis found no significant difference in negative AUDIT status between the three interventions. Compared with the patient information booklet group, the odds ratio of having a negative AUDIT result for brief advice was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.39) and for brief lifestyle advice was 0.78 (0.48 to 1.25). A per-protocol analysis confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS All patients received simple information about the result of their screening. Beyond this input, however, evidence was lacking that brief advice or brief lifestyle advice provided an important additional benefit in reducing risky or harmful drinking compared to the patient information leaflet.

662,Efficacy of screening and treating depression in indigent outpatients,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of depression screening and treatment among indigent outpatients visiting resident physicians. DESIGN: Two-arm randomized trial (N = 33 intervention, N = 28 usual care) with baseline, 6-month, and 12-month outcome measurements. PLACE: Internal Medicine Residency Clinic. PATIENTS: Clinical patients older than 18 years who tested positive for depression on PRIME-MD during a visit to their resident physician. Patients did not receive treatment or seek care for any emotional problems. All patients were enrolled in Medicaid or had income below the poverty line. INTERVENTION: Resident physicians were educated to follow the AHCPR (AHRQ""; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in a primary care setting. For patients residents in the intervention group, a screening nurse counseled residents about positive screening, provided them with a standardized protocol outline, and attempted to organize behavioral care Patients in the usual care group received the results of the screening nurse prior to their visit with the resident, and they were advised to seek care for their symptoms MAIN RESULTS: Results for the primary outcome of depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) demonstrated that the intervention was successful in reducing symptoms relative to usual care (difference = -4.9 BDI points, P = 0.05, interval 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.8 to -0.005 effect size = -0.41). During the 12-month follow-up, 70% of intervention patients received treatment for depression (of these, 91% with antidepressants), while 15% of usual care patients received antidepressant treatment for depression. Another 18% of the usual care group had depression, but no treatment was identified. The differences in BDI between the intervention and control groups were similar at the 6- and 12-month measures. Quality of life and costs were also measured, but the differences between groups were not significant in this regard. CONCLUSION: Screening for and treatment of depression by resident physicians was successful in reducing symptoms relative to usual care in an indigent population. Nearly twice as many intervention patients as usual care controls demonstrated a substantial reduction (10 BDI points) in depression-related symptoms.",0,0,
663,"Effectiveness of strategies to disseminate and implement clinical guidelines for the management of impacted and unerupted third molars in primary dental care, a cluster randomized controlled trial","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different guideline implementation strategies, using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline 42 ""Management of unerupted and impacted third molars"" (published in 2000) as a model. . DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster RCT (2x2 factorial design). SUBJECTS: Sixty-three dental practices throughout Scotland. Clinical records of all patients aged 16 to 24 years during two four-month periods in 1999 (before intervention) and 2000 (after intervention) were searched by a clinical investigator blinded to the intervention group. Data on the costs of the interventions were also collected. INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 received a copy of the SIGN 42 Guide and had the opportunity to attend a postgraduate education course (PGEC). In addition to this, group 2 received audit and feedback (A and F). Group 3 received a computer-assisted learning (CAL) package. Group 4 received A and F and CAL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of patients whose treatment complied with the guideline. RESULTS: Weighted t-tests for A and F versus no A and F (P = 0.62) and CAL versus no CAL (P = 0.76) were not statistically significant. Given the efficacy results (no difference), the profitability calculation was converted to a cost minimization calculation. The least cost intervention in the trial was to provide general dentists (GDP) with guidelines and the option to attend PGEC courses. Routine data that subsequently became available showed a Scotland-wide drop in removals prior to data collection. CONCLUSION: In a setting where pre-intervention compliance was unexpectedly high, neither CAL nor A and F increased dentists' compliance with the SIGN guideline compared with mailing the guideline and the opportunity to attend. a postgraduate course. The cost of the CAL arm of the trial was higher than arm A and F. More work is required to understand the behavior of dental professionals in response to guideline implementation strategies.",0,1,

665,Efficacy of community pharmacist visits for patients with heart failure: a randomized controlled trial HeartMed,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether an intervention of medication review, symptom self-management, and lifestyle advice by community pharmacists could reduce hospital admissions or mortality in patients with heart failure. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SCOPE Home intervention in patients with heart failure. PARTICIPANTS 293 patients diagnosed with heart failure (149 intervention, 144 control) after emergency admission were included. INTERVENTION Two home visits by one of 17 community pharmacists within two and eight weeks of discharge. Pharmacists reviewed medications and provided self-management of symptoms and lifestyle advice. Controls received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was total hospital readmissions at six months. Secondary outcomes included mortality and quality of life (Minnesota Heart Failure Life Questionnaire and EQ-5D). RESULTS Primary outcome data were available for 291 participants (99%). 136 (91%) intervention patients received one or two visits. There were 134 admissions in the intervention group compared to 112 in the control group (rate ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.48""; P = 0.28, model 30 patients died from the intervention compared with 24 controls (hazard ratio = 1.18)., 0.69 to 2.03, P = 0.54). Although the EQ-5D scores favored the intervention group, Minnesota Life with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores favored controls;"" neither difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION This community pharmacist intervention did not lead to reductions in hospital admissions in contrast to those found in trials of nurse-led interventions in heart failure. Given that heart failure accounts for 5% of hospital admissions, these results present a problem for policymakers who are faced with a shortage of specialists and hope that trained community pharmacists can deliver the same benefits.

667,Effects of an exercise program and physician referral for men who have completed active treatment for prostate cancer: a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (ENGAGE),"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a physician-referred exercise program in improving exercise levels and quality of life in men with prostate cancer. METHODS: This was a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in Melbourne, Australia, comprising 15 clinicians: 8 clinicians were randomly assigned to refer eligible participants (n = 54) to a 12-week exercise program comprising 2 sessions of supervised gymnastics and 1 home session per week, and 7 clinicians were randomized to follow usual care (n = 93). The primary outcome was self-reported physical activity; secondary outcomes were quality of life, anxiety, and symptoms of depression. RESULTS: A significant intervention effect was observed for vigorous-intensity exercise (effect size: d for Cohen, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.82; P = .010), but not for combined levels of moderate and vigorous exercise (effect size, d, 0.08; CI 95%, -0.28 to 0.45; P = 0.48).Significant intervention effects were also seen for adherence to exercise guidelines (>/= 150 min/week; odds ratio, 3, 9; 95% CI, 1.9-7.8; P = .002), positive intervention effects were seen in the intervention group for cognitive functioning (effect size: d, 0.34; 95% CI %, -0.02 to 0.70; P = 0.06) and symptoms of depression (effect size: d, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.71 to 0.02; P = 0 .06).Eighty percent of the participants reported that the physician's referral influenced their decision to participate in the exercise program.

669,"Effects of a multifaceted intervention on cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk hypertensive patients: the ESCAPE trial, a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in general practice","BACKGROUND: Several observational studies in hypertensive patients have shown a gap between the therapeutic goals recommended in the guidelines and those achieved in daily practice. The ESCAPE trial aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention focused on general practitioners (GPs) could significantly increase the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention who achieved all recommended therapeutic goals. METHODS: A pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial involving 257 GPs randomized by region. GPs in the intervention group had a one-day training session and received an electronic blood pressure measurement device and a brief recommendation booklet. Along with routine follow-up, they focused on a consultation on hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors every six months for two years. They also received baseline and 1-year feedback on their patients' clinical and biological parameters. The main outcome measures were the change in the proportion of patients achieving all of their therapeutic goals and each individual therapeutic goal at two years, and quality of life. RESULTS: 1,832 high-risk hypertensive patients were included. After two years, the proportion of patients who achieved all their therapeutic goals increased significantly in both groups, but significantly more in the intervention group: OR (odds ratio) 1.89, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 .09 to 3.27, P = 0.02). Significantly more patients achieved their blood pressure targets in the intervention group than in the usual care group: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.88, P < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the usual care group, by 4.8 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.0001 for both). There were no significant differences in changes in physical and mental quality of life between the groups. CONCLUSION: A multifaceted, easy-to-perform intervention targeting only GPs significantly increased the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention who achieved their recommended therapeutic goals.

670,Effects of a short course of eszopiclone on adherence to continuous positive airway pressure,"Background: Short-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence may predict long-term use. Unfortunately, initial intolerance to CPAP can lead to poor adherence or discontinuation of therapy. Objective: To determine whether a short course of eszopiclone at the start of therapy improves long-term adherence to CPAP more than placebo in adults with obstructive sleep apnea. Design: Parallel randomized, placebo-controlled trial from March 2007 to December 2008. Randomization, centrally maintained and masked by pharmacy staff, was computer generated using fixed blocks of 10. Referring physicians, investigators, and patients they were blinded to treatment assignment until after final data was collected.

Patients: 160 adults (mean age, 45.7 years [SD, 7.3]""; mean apnea indexaâ‚¬Â¡Â°, 36.9 events/h [SD, 23]) with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea who started CPAP Intervention: Eszopiclone, 3 mg (n? = 76), or matching placebo (n? = 78) during the first 14 nights of CPAP Measurements: CPAP use was measured weekly for 24 weeks. CPAP adherence (primary outcome) and CPAP discontinuation rate and symptom improvement (secondary outcomes) Follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months was completed in 150, 136, and 120 patients, respectively. : Patients in the eszopiclone group used CPAP 20.8% more nights (95% CI, 7.2% to 34.4%; P? = 0.003), 1.3 hours more per night for all nights (CI, 0.4 to 2.2 hours; P? = 0.005) and 1.1 more hours per night of CPAP use (CI, 0.2 to 2.1 hours; P? = 0.019). risk for CPAP discontinuation was 1.90 (CI, 1.1 to 3.4; P? = 0.03 3) times ma higher in the placebo group. Side effects were reported in 7.1% of patients and did not differ between groups. Limitations: patients had severe obstructive sleep apnea treated in a specialized sleep center with frequent follow-up; results may not be generalizable to different settings. Patients' tolerance to CPAP and their reasons for discontinuation were not assessed. Conclusion: Compared to placebo, a short course of eszopiclone during the first 2 weeks of CPAP improved adherence and led to fewer patients discontinuing therapy.

671,Effects of an automated electronic reminder on changing antiplatelet medication prescription behavior among Italian general practitioners in diabetic patients: an intervention trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether an electronic reminder integrated into a routine computer system increases the use of antiplatelet drugs for diabetic patients among Italian general practitioners (GPs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out among 300 general practitioners and their patients selected from the health search database. Among these, 150 general practitioners (intervention group) were instructed to activate an electronic reminder plus a letter summarizing the beneficial effects of antiplatelet drugs in diabetic patients with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor (""high risk""), while that the other 150 general practitioners (control group) received only the letter. The electronic reminder, integrated into a standard software system for daily clinical practice management, was displayed when each participating GP opened the medical record of diabetic patients aged ≥30 years. Only high-risk diabetic patients were included in the analysis. Patients were considered to be on antiplatelet therapy if they received two or more prescriptions at baseline and during follow-up. RESULTS—15,343 high-risk diabetic patients were selected, 7,313 belonging to general practitioners in the control group and 8,030 belonging to general practitioners in the intervention group. Overall, 1,672 patients (22.9%) in the control group and 1,886 (23.5%) patients in the intervention group received antiplatelet drugs at baseline (P = NS). At the end of follow-up, the number of treated patients was significantly increased in the intervention group (odds ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.22) compared to the control group. The effect of the electronic reminder was more relevant among those patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors but without previous cardiovascular diseases (CVD), compared to those with CVD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of the effect of an electronic reminder affecting the prescribing behavior of GPs.",1,1,
672,Effects of a testing service on the use of research tests by community AIDS service organizations: a protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background To support the use of research evidence by community-based organizations (CBOs), we have developed 'Synthesized Research Evidence on HIV/AIDS' (SHARE), which is an evidence service for those working in the sector. of HIV. SHARE consists of several components: an online searchable database of HIV-relevant systematic reviews (retrievable based on a taxonomy of HIV/AIDS-related topics and open text search); regular email updates; access to user-friendly summaries; and peer relevance assessments. Our goal is to assess whether this 'full-service' testing service increases the use of investigative testing by community organizations compared to a 'self-service' testing service. Methods/Design We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), along with a follow-up qualitative process study to explore the findings further. All CBOs affiliated with the Canadian AIDS Society (n = 120) will be invited to participate and randomly assigned to receive either the 'full service' version of SHARE or the 'self service' version (a list of relevant systematic reviews with links to PubMed records and worksheets that help community organizations find and use research evidence) using a simple randomized design. All management and staff in each organization will have access to the version of SHARE to which their organization is assigned. The duration of the trial will be 10 months (baseline period of two months, intervention period of six months and crossover period of two months), the main outcome measure will be the mean number of logins/month/organization (averaged between the number of users in each organization) between the baseline and the end of the intervention period. The secondary outcome will be the intention to use research evidence measured by a survey administered to a key decision maker from each organization. For the qualitative study, a purposive sample of a key organizational decision maker will be taken from 15 organizations in each trial arm (n = 30). One-on-one semi-structured interviews will be conducted over the phone about their views and experiences with the testing service they received, how helpful it was in their job, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and least helpful and why, and recommendations for next steps. Discussion To our knowledge, this will be the first RCT to assess the effects of an evidence service designed specifically to help CBOs find and use research evidence.",0,0,

674,Effects of computerized reminders for influenza vaccination on morbidity during influenza epidemics.,"To study the effects of computer-generated reminders for influenza vaccination of patients at high risk for lung disease during the winter, we selected 4,555 such patients from a population of 15,000 adults who participated in a three-year randomized trial of preventive care reminders. Physicians who received the reminders vaccinated eligible patients twice as often as control physicians (P = 0.0001). There was a linear increase in the incidence of influenza in our area over the three winters under study (from 1,000 to 33,451 to 71,075 cases per year), and we modeled the percentage of patients with hospitalizations, emergency room visits with chest x-ray, and blood test. gas determinations as a logistic function of this increase. The difference in linear trends between patients in the intervention group (whose physicians received reminders) and those in the control group was significant for emergency room visits (P less than 0.05), hospitalizations (P less than 0.01) and blood gas determinations (P less than 0.001). The most likely explanation for the difference is the higher use of the influenza vaccine in the intervention group.",0,1,
675,Effects of computerized reminders on complications of peripheral venous catheters and adherence of nurses to a guideline in pediatric care: a randomized cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Reminder systems in electronic patient records (EPRs) have been shown to affect both healthcare professional behavior and patient outcomes. The objective of this cluster-randomized trial was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVC) in pediatric care in the form of reminders integrated into the EPRs, on PVC-related complications and on registered records. Self-reported adherence of nurses (RN) to the guideline. An additional objective was to study the relationship between contextual factors and intervention outcomes. METHODS: The study involved 12 inpatient units at a pediatric university hospital. Reminders included PVC choice, hygiene, maintenance, and daily inspection of the PVC site. The primary outcome was documentation of signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at the time of extraction, obtained from the RPE. The secondary outcome was RNs' adherence to a PVC guideline, collected through a questionnaire that also included the RNs' perceived work context, as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. The units were assigned in two strata, depending on the appearance of PVC. A simple blind lottery from each stratum randomized six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively. The units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 after the intervention, and the control group 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 after the intervention. The newborns included at the beginning of the study were 212 (65.4%) and 208 (71.5%) after the intervention. RESULTS: No significant effect of computer reminders on PVC-related complications or NB compliance with guideline recommendations was found. The complication rate at baseline and postoperatively was 40.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 36.7-44.5) and 41.9% (95% CI 38.0- 45.8), for the intervention group and 40.3% (95% CI 36.8-44.0) and 46.9% (95% CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. Overall, the RNs' self-assessed work context ranged from moderately low to moderately high, indicating that the conditions for successful implementation were less than optimal. CONCLUSIONS: Reminders could have benefited from being accompanied by a personalized intervention that targeted specific barriers, such as low frequency of recorded reasons for removal, low adherence to daily inspection of PVC sites, and lack of regular feedback. to the RNs.

676,Effects of computerized guidelines for the management of heart diseases in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Electronic information systems have been proposed as a means to reduce medical errors of commission (doing something wrong) and omission (not providing the right care). OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of computer-based cardiac care suggestions. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial targeting primary care physicians and pharmacists. SUBJECTS: A total of 706 outpatients with heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians and pharmacists were shown evidence-based cardiac care suggestions, approved by a panel of local cardiologists and general internists, while caring for enrolled patients. MEASURES: Compliance with care suggestions, generic and condition-specific quality of life, acute exacerbations of their heart disease, medication adherence, health care costs, satisfaction with care, and physicians' attitudes toward guidelines. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 1 year during which they made 3419 primary care visits and were eligible for 2609 separate suggestions for cardiac care. The intervention had no effect on physicians' adherence to care suggestions (23% for intervention patients vs. 22% for controls). There were no differences between intervention and control in quality of life, medication adherence, health care utilization, costs, or satisfaction with care. Physicians found the guidelines to provide useful information but restrict their practice and not help make decisions for individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Care suggestions generated by a sophisticated electronic medical record system failed to improve adherence to accepted practice guidelines or outcomes for patients with heart disease. Future studies need to weigh the benefits and costs of different (and perhaps more draconian) methods of affecting clinical behavior.",1,1,
677,Effects of general practitioner training and family support services in the care of patients with home dementia: results of a cluster-randomized controlled study,"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of patients with dementia are cared for by their general practitioners, who are instrumental in diagnosis, treatment, and recommendation of support services. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the special training of general practitioners alters the care of patients with dementia through their systematic recommendation of support groups and advice to caregivers. METHOD: 129 general practitioners enrolled 390 patients with dementia and their informal caregivers in a two-year prospective three-arm cluster-randomized study. Group A constituted usual care, in Groups B and C support groups and caregiver advice (in Group B one year after baseline, in Group C at baseline) were recommended by general practitioners. General practitioners received arm-specific training. The diagnostic and therapeutic behavior of the physicians was recorded at the beginning of the study. Informal caregivers were asked at the 2-year follow-up about their use of support services. RESULTS: The diagnostic behavior of general practitioners conforms to the relevant guidelines. The procedure in newly diagnosed patients does not differ from previously diagnosed patients with the exception of the rate of referral to a specialist. About a third of newly diagnosed dementia patients receive an anti-dementia drug. The use of support and counseling groups increased five and four times, respectively. Utilization of other support services remained low (<10%), with the exception of home nursing and short-term institutional nursing. CONCLUSION: Trained general practitioners often act in accordance with guidelines regarding the diagnosis of dementia, and partly in accordance with guidelines regarding recommended drug therapy. Recommendations of support services for informal caregivers by the general practitioner are successful. They result in a marked increase in the utilization rate of recommended services compared to offerings that are not recommended by the general practitioner. TEST REGISTRATION: ISRCTN68329593.",0,0,
678,Effects of interactive voice response self-monitoring on the natural resolution of drinking problems: Utilization and behavioral economics.,"Objective: Most problem drinkers do not seek help and many recover on their own. A randomized controlled trial evaluated whether interactive voice response (IVR) self-monitoring support facilitated such 'natural' resolutions. Based on behavioral economics, it was hypothesized that the effects on drinking outcomes vary with drinkers' reference ""time horizons,"" reflecting preferences between products of different value available at different prices. delays and with their use of IVR. METHOD: Drinkers with recently resolved untreated problems were randomized to a 24-week IVR self-monitoring program (n = 87) or an assessment-only control condition (n = 98). Baseline interviews assessed predictors of outcomes, including behavioral economic measures of reward preferences (delay discount, pre-resolution monetary allowance for alcohol versus savings). Outcomes at six months were classified as resolved abstinence, non-resolved abstinence, unresolved or missing. Complier causal average effect (CACE) models examined the self-monitoring effects of IVR. Results: IVR self-monitoring adherents (>=70% of completed scheduled calls) were older and had greater preresolution alcohol control and fewer discounts than non-compliers (<70%). An interaction of the CACE model showed that observed adherers in the IVR group with shorter time horizons (expressed by higher alcohol expenditure before resolution than savers) were more likely to achieve moderation than abstinent resolutions compared with predicted achievers in the control group with shorter time horizons. and with all the defaulters. Intention-to-treat analytic models revealed no effects related to IVR. A more balanced spending on savings versus alcohol predicted moderation in both approaches. Conclusions: IVR interventions should consider factors that affect IVR utilization and drinking outcomes, including person-specific behavioral economic variables. CACE models provide tools for evaluating interventions that involve extended participation. (PsycINFO Database Registry (c) 2016 APA, All Rights Reserved)",0,0,

681,Efficacy and safety of sucrose for procedural pain relief in preterm and term infants,"BACKGROUND: Premature and acutely ill term infants who are hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit are subjected to multiple frequent painful and invasive procedures intended to improve their outcome. Although several trials have been developed to determine the efficacy of sucrose for procedural pain management in acutely ill preterm and term infants, these have generally lacked methodological rigor and have not provided clinicians with practice guidelines. clear. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of three interventions for the relief of pain related to heel sticks in preterm and term infants, and to explore the influence of contextual factors such as gender, disease severity and painful procedures. prior to pain responses. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 190 neonates were stratified by gestational age and then randomized to receive (a) sucrose and nonnutritive suckling (n = 64), (b) sucrose alone (n = 62), or (c) sucrose alone. sterile water and non-nutritive sucking (control) (n = 64) to assess efficacy (pain response as measured by the Preterm Infant Pain Profile) (Stevens, Johnson, Petryshen, & Taddio, 1996) and safety (adverse events) after a scheduled heel lance during the first week of life. Stratification was used to control for the effects of age on pain response. RESULTS: There were significant differences in pain response between the treatment groups (F = 22.49, p < 0.001), with the lowest mean preterm infant pain profile scores in the sucrose and non-nutritive sucking group. The efficacy of sucrose after heel lance was not affected by disease severity, postnatal age, or the number of painful procedures. Intervention group and gender explained 12% of the variation in preterm infant pain profile scores. Few adverse events occurred (n = 6), and none of them required medical or nursing intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sucrose and non-nutritive suction is the most effective intervention for single heel sticks.

683,Efficacy of cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy applied by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder: a research protocol,"BACKGROUND: Contrary to the recommendations of the clinical practice guidelines, the most common treatment for anxiety disorders and depression in primary care is pharmacological. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral psychological intervention, carried out by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder compared to usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with two parallel groups. A random sample of 246 patients with mild-moderate mixed anxiety-depressive disorder will be selected from the target population from the lists of 41 primary care physicians. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which will receive standardized cognitive behavioral therapy delivered by psychologists along with usual care, or a control group, which will receive only usual care. The cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention consists of eight 60-minute individual face-to-face sessions delivered over eight consecutive weeks. A telephone follow-up session will be carried out, for reinforcement or referral in your case, 6 months after the intervention, as required. The main outcome variable will be the change in Short Form-36 General Health Survey scores. We will also measure the change in the frequency and intensity of symptoms of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months later. In addition, we will collect information about the use of medicines and health care services. DISCUSSION: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral psychological intervention based on primary care in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. International scientific evidence has shown the need for psychologists in primary care. However, given the differences between health policies and health services, it is important to check the effect of these psychological interventions in our geographical environment.

684,Efficacy of a nurse-led email reminder program for cardiovascular prevention risk reduction in hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Many strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVD). Individualized lifestyle education programs via telephone and telenurse counseling have been found to improve blood pressure control and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. This study tested the efficacy of a nurse-led reminder program via email (NRP-e) in improving CVD risk factors among hypertensive adults. METHODS: All participants received the usual CVD prevention and guideline-based educational program. Subjects in the NRP-e group also received weekly email alerts and phone calls from a nurse care manager for 6 months. The emails contained a reminder program about the need to follow a healthy lifestyle based on current guidelines. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months after enrollment; randomization was performed centrally and blood samples were evaluated in a single laboratory. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 98 (control) and 100 (NRP-e) subjects (mean age 59.0 +/- 14.5 years; ""51.0% male). After 6 months, the following factors of CVD risk were significantly improved in both groups: body mass index, alcohol and fruit consumption, smoking, adherence to hours of therapy, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and cholesterol total, triglycerides and physical activity.In the NRP-e group, however, the prevalence of several risk behaviors or conditions decreased significantly more than in the control group: obesity (-16%), low consumption of fruits (-24% ), uncontrolled hypertension (-61%), LDL (-56%), and total cholesterol (-40%). CONCLUSIONS: The e-NRP improved a number of CVD risk factors. The program had low costs, required only an average of <20 min per day in addition to normal practice, and may warrant further evaluation for in inclusion among existing care management approaches.",0,0,

The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy of a guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy. manual to increase resilience in caregivers of people with depression, compared to caregivers who receive only routine support. A randomized controlled trial was carried out, following the CONSORT guidelines, with 54 caregivers assigned to a parallel intervention (self-help manual) ( n = 27) or control (standard support) (n = 27). Resilience was assessed at baseline, post-test (week 8), and at follow-up (week 12). Intention-to-treat analyzes were performed. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant difference in resilience scores between the three time points, showing a large effect. Pairwise comparisons between intervention and control groups indicated that resilience was significantly different between baseline and endpoint. post-test, and between baseline and follow-up, but not between post-test and follow-up. Overall, the intervention group showed a slightly greater increase in resilience over time than the control group; however, the time group interaction was not significant.

DESIGN Randomized placebo-controlled trial, blinded by the participant and the single evaluator. SETTING Melbourne Metropolitan Region, Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 120 participants with chronic (>3 months) rotator cuff disease recruited through physicians and the community. INTERVENTIONS Active treatment consisted of manual therapy and a home exercise program; placebo treatment consisted of inactive ultrasound therapy and the application of an inert gel. Participants in both groups received 10 individual standardized treatment sessions over 10 weeks. For the next 12 weeks, the active group continued with the home exercise program and the placebo group received no treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES Primary outcomes were pain and function as measured by shoulder pain and disability index , average pain with movement measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale, and participants' pain. PERCEIVED GLOBAL RATING OF GENERAL CHANGE RESULTS 112 (93%) participants completed the 22-week trial At 11 weeks no difference was found between groups for change in shoulder pain and disability index (3.6, confidence interval of 95% -2.1 to 9.4) or change in pain (0.7, -0.1 to 1.5);"" both groups showed significant improvements. More participants in the active group reported a successful outcome (defined as ""much better""), although the difference was not statistically significant: 42% (24/57) of active participants and 30% (18/61) of placebo participants (relative risk 1.43, 0.87 to 2.34). showed significantly greater improvement in shoulder pain and disability index than the placebo group at 22 weeks (between group difference 7.1, 0.3 to 13.9), although there was no significant difference between the groups for change in pain (0.9, -0.03 to 1.7) or for percent Percentage of participants reporting a successful treatment outcome (relative risk 1.39, 0.94 to 2.03). Several secondary outcomes favored the active group, including shoulder pain and disability index functional score, muscle strength, interference with activity, and quality of life. CONCLUSION A standardized manual therapy and home exercise program conferred no additional immediate benefits for pain and function compared with a realistic placebo treatment that controlled therapist contact in middle-aged to older adults with chronic rotator cuff disease. However, greater improvements were seen during follow-up, particularly in shoulder function and strength, suggesting that benefits with active treatment take longer to manifest.

688,Efficiency of guidelines and educational program: a training process for the diagnosis of low back pain,"BACKGROUND: The Italian National Health Plan has included low back pain (LBP) among the pathologies for which clinical guidelines should be created and disseminated. A change in the clinical behavior of physicians requires forms of intervention whose efficacy is not fully known. OBJECTIVES: This study proposes to evaluate the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention, including educational materials, conferences, workshops and local consensus processes, in order to modify the clinical treatment of low back pain by general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: Changes in diagnostic capacity have been evaluated through a controlled trial (before/after) based on the frequency of etiological diagnoses of low back pain, the test of clinical knowledge with multiple choice tests and the priorities given to face the problems of treatment of low back pain by patients. the three groups of general practitioners who had voluntarily joined the study. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in diagnostic ability (the frequency of correct answers in the multiple choice test) was achieved. There was also a change in priorities in dealing with problems in the treatment of low back pain, from diagnosis as the main issue before intervening, to communication with the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Within the Italian context, the study also confirms the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention based on a training process aimed at modifying the GP's clinical behavior regarding low back pain.",0,0,

We hypothesize that the use of a computerized alert program to encourage prophylaxis might reduce the frequency of deep vein thrombosis among high-risk hospitalized patients. METHODS We developed a patient database-linked computer program to identify consecutive hospitalized patients at risk of deep vein thrombosis in the absence of prophylaxis. The program used medical record numbers to randomly assign 1,255 eligible patients to an intervention group, in which the attending physician was alerted to the patient's risk of DVT, and 1,251 patients to a control group, in which they did not. no alert was issued. The physician was asked to acknowledge receipt of the alert and could then deny or order prophylaxis, including graduated compression stockings, pneumatic compression boots, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or warfarin. The primary endpoint was clinical diagnosis, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days. RESULTS More patients in the intervention group than in the control group received mechanical prophylaxis (10.0 percent vs. 1.5 percent, P < 0.001) or pharmacologic prophylaxis (23.6 percent vs. 13.0 percent). percent, P < 0.001).

A practical, sustainable and transferable strategy is needed. This study evaluates the impact of a novel computerized antimicrobial approval system on antibiotic prescribing behavior in a hospital. Effects on drug consumption, antibiotic resistance patterns of local bacteria, and patient outcomes were monitored. Methods The study was conducted at a tertiary referral university hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The system was implemented in January 2005 and guided the use of 28 restricted antimicrobials. Data was collected for 7 years: 5 years before and 2 years after deployment. System adoption was assessed using a built-in audit trail. Drug utilization was prospectively monitored using pharmacy data (as defined daily doses per 1000 bed-days) and analyzed by time-series analysis with segmental linear regression. Antibiograms of local bacteria were prospectively evaluated. Hospital mortality and length of hospital stay for patients with gram-negative bacteremia were also reported. Results There were between 250 and 300 approvals per month during 2006. Gradients in the use of third and fourth generation cephalosporins (+0.52, -0.05, -0.39""; P < 0.01), glycopeptides (+0.27, -0.53; P = 0.09), carbapenems (+0.12, -0.24; P = 0.21), aminoglycosides (+0.15, -0.27; P < 0.01), and quinolones (+0.76 , +0.11;"" P = 0.08) all fell after deployment, while the use of extended-spectrum penicillin increased. Trends in increasing susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin and better susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. to many antibiotics were observed. No increase in adverse outcomes was observed in patients with gram-negative bacteremia. Conclusions The system was successfully adopted and significant changes in antimicrobial use were demonstrated.",0,1,
693,E-Isotretinoin Electronic Prescription Chart: Improving Physician Compliance with Isotretinoin Prescription Guidelines,"Oral isotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for refractory nodulocystic acne. However, it can be associated with serious adverse effects such as teratogenicity and hepatitis. Inadequate cumulative dosing can also result in reduced therapeutic efficacy and further disease relapse. A preliminary audit had previously revealed poor and inconsistent adherence to local isotretinoin prescribing guidelines by physicians. To achieve greater than 90% adherence to isotretinoin regimens for all acne patients prescribed systemic isotretinoin at the National Skin Center Singapore, key areas and reasons for non-adherence were identified . Launched a specifically designed ""one stop shop"" electronic isotretinoin chart within the electronic medical record (EMR) system to address important safety areas"";"" namely, patient informed consent, pregnancy tests, reference laboratory tests, and automatic calculation of cumulative and target isotretinoin doses. Physician adherence to prescribing guidelines improved from a baseline of 50% to 60% to greater than 90% (range 95% to 100%) for 30 consecutive months after intervention. The e-isotretinoin chart has resulted in a significant improvement in clinician adherence to isotretinoin prescribing guidelines and highlights the utility of EMR technology in influencing safe prescribing behavior among clinicians.",0,1,
694,Decision support on electronic health records and quality of care for children with ADHD.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of electronic health record (EHR) decision support on the medical management and documentation of care of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: This study involved 79 general pediatricians in 12 pediatric primary care practices using the same EHR caring for 412 children who were 5 to 18 years old and had a prior diagnosis of ADHD. We conducted an EHR-based decision support group randomized trial that included (1) clinician reminders to assess ADHD symptoms every 3 to 6 months and (2) an ADHD note template with structured fields for symptoms, treatment efficacy, and adverse effects. The main outcome measures were (1) the proportion of children with visits during the 6-month study period in which ADHD was assessed, and (2) the quality of documentation of the ADHD assessment. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for provider grouping. RESULTS: Children at intervention sites were more likely to have had a visit during the study period in which their ADHD was assessed. The ADHD template was used in 32% of visits in which patients were scheduled specifically for ADHD assessment, and its use was associated with better documentation of symptoms, treatment effectiveness, and treatment adverse effects. . CONCLUSIONS: EHR-based decision support improved the likelihood that children with ADHD would have visits and care related to managing this condition. A better understanding of how to optimize the use of templates and decision support by providers could promote further improvements in care.",0,1,
695,Electronic health record feedback to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections,"Objective: To examine whether the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Quality Dashboard, an electronic health record (EHR)-based feedback system, changed antibiotic prescribing. Study Design: Controlled, randomized cluster trial. Methods: We randomly assigned 27 primary care practices to receive either the ARI Quality Dashboard or usual care. The primary outcome was the intention-to-intervene antibiotic prescription rate for ARI visits. We also compared antibiotic prescribing between users and non-users from the ARI Quality Panel. Results: During the 9-month intervention, there was no difference between intervention and control practices in antibiotic prescribing for all ARI visits (47% vs. 47%""; P = .87), appropriate ARI visits for antibiotic (65% vs. 64%; P = .68), or IRA visits not appropriate for antibiotics (38% vs. 40%; P = .70).Among the 258 interventional physicians, 72 ( 28%) used the ARI Quality Panel at least once an overall lower rate of antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs (42% vs. 50% for non-users; p=0.02).This difference was due to to less antibiotic prescription for ARIs not appropriate for antibiotics (32% vs. 43%; P = .004), including nonstreptococcal pharyngitis (31% vs. 41%; P = .01) and nonspecific infections of upper airway (19% vs. 34%; P = .01). Conclusions: The ARI quality panel was not associated with an overall change in antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, although when used, was associated with better antibiotic prescribing EHR-based quality reporting, as part of 'meaningful use', m may not improve care in the absence of other changes in practice primary care.

696,Electronic health record-based decision support for improving asthma care: a cluster-randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Asthma remains one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, affecting _x0001_6 million American children. Although the National Asthma Prevention Education Program guidelines exist and are widely accepted, previous studies have shown poor adherence by clinicians in a variety of populations. We sought to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) integrated into an electronic health record (EHR) would improve clinician adherence to national asthma guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial at 12 primary care sites over a 1-year period. Practices were stratified for analysis based on whether the site was urban or suburban. Children aged 0 to 18 years with persistent asthma were identified by asthma codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. All 6 intervention practice sites had CDS alerts integrated into the EHR. The outcomes of interest were the proportion of children with at least one prescription for controller medication, an updated asthma care plan, and office spirometry performance. RESULTS: The increases in the number of prescriptions for controller medications, over time, were 6% higher (P .006) and 3% higher for spirometry (P .04) in the urban intervention practices. Presenting an updated asthma care plan improved 14% (p 0.03) and spirometry improved 6% (p 0.003) in suburban practices with the intervention. CONCLUSION: In our study, using a cluster-randomized trial design, CDS in the EHR, at the point of care, improved physician compliance with the National Asthma Prevention Education Program guidelines.

697,Electronic Health Records for Intervention Research: A Cluster Randomized Trial to Reduce Antibiotic Prescription in Primary Care (eCRT Study),"PURPOSE This study aimed to implement a point-of-care cluster randomized trial using electronic health records. We evaluated the effectiveness of electronically provided decision support tools in reducing antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections in primary care. METHODS Family practices from England and Scotland participating in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were included in the trial; 53 family practices were assigned to intervention and 51 practices were assigned to usual care. Patients aged 18 to 59 years consulting for respiratory tract infections were eligible. The intervention was through remotely installed and computer-managed decision support tools that were accessed during consultations. Control practices provided usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of consultations for respiratory tract infections with an antibiotic prescribed based on electronic health records. Family practice-specific proportions were included in a cluster-level analysis. RESULTS Data from 603,409 patients were analysed: 317,717 in intervention practices and 285,692 in control practices. expected, varying between practices. There was a reduction in the proportion of consultations with bedside antibiotic prescription of 1.85% (95% CI, 0.10%–3.59%, P = .038) and in the rate of prescription of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections (9.69%; 95% CI, 0.75%–18.63%, fewer prescriptions per 1,000 patient-years, P = .034). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Cluster randomized trials can be efficiently implemented in large samples of routine care settings by using primary care electronic health records. Future studies should develop and test multicomponent methods for remote intervention.",0,1,
698,The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Electronic Clinical Reminder System Improves Compliance with Practice Guidelines Among the University of Washington HIV Study Cohort.,"We conducted a prospective study of an electronic clinical reminder system in a specialized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic based at an academic medical center. Published performance indicators were used to examine adherence to HIV practice guidelines before and after their implementation for 1,204 patients. More than 90% of patients received CD4 cell count and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level monitoring every 3 to 6 months during both time periods, and 80% of patients with nadir CD4 cells of <350 cells/mm3 received highly active antiretroviral therapy. Patients were significantly more likely to receive Mycobacterium avium complex prophylaxis (hazard ratio, 3.84""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58–9.31; P = .003), to undergo annual screening for cervical carcinoma (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.04–4.16; P = .04), and serologic screening for Toxoplasma gondii (odds ratio [OR] , 1.86; 95% CI, 1.05–3.27; P = .03) and syphilis infection (OR, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.37–5.81; P < 0 .0001) HIV clinical reminders delivered at the time HIV care is provided were associated with more timely initiation of recommended practices.",0,1,
699,Electronic ordering of laboratory drugs with evidence-based ordering sets in primary care (ELMO study): protocol for a cluster randomized trial,"Background Laboratory tests are an important clinical act with a valuable role in the detection, diagnosis, management and monitoring of diseases or therapies. However, the request for inappropriate laboratory tests is frequent, which places a burden on health spending and negatively influences the quality of care. Inappropriate testing can also result in false-positive results and potentially cause excessive downstream activities. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have shown promise in influencing clinicians' test-ordering behavior and improving appropriateness. Order sets, a form of CDSS where a limited set of evidence-based tests are proposed for a number of indications, integrated into a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) have been shown to be effective in reducing the volume of laboratory tests neat but convincing. evidence that they influence suitability is lacking. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of order sets on the quality and quantity of laboratory test orders by physicians. We also intend to assess the effect of order sets on diagnostic error and explore the effect on subsequent or cascading activities. Methods We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in Belgian primary care practices. The study is designed to measure two outcomes. We will primarily measure the influence of our CDSS on the appropriateness of ordering laboratory tests. In addition, we will also measure the influence on the diagnostic error. We will also explore the effects of our intervention on cascading activities due to altered inappropriate test results. Discussion We have designed a study that should be able to demonstrate whether the CDSS intended for diagnostic tests is not only capable of influencing suitability but also safety with respect to diagnostic error. These findings will influence broader national-level implementation of this CDSS. ClinicalTrials.gov Trial Registry, NCT02950142.",0,0,
700,Electronic medical record to increase the clinical treatment of smoking: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: The expanded use of electronic medical records (EMRs) may provide an opportunity to increase the use and impact of clinical guidelines to promote smoking cessation treatment in primary care settings. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the evidence for such an effect. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Following a systematic search of the English-language literature regarding an effect of EMR on smoking cessation or physician behaviour, relevant articles and findings from observational studies and RCTs were abstracted. . EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of ten identified studies of RMS and tobacco, only two RCTs were found. Adding smoking status as a vital sign resulted in an increase in some guideline-recommended actions, particularly documentation of smoking status. There was insufficient evidence to quantify the effect of an RMS on changes in patients' smoking behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of EMRs to elicit or provide feedback on clinical tobacco dependence treatment demonstrates some promising results, substantial additional research is needed to understand the effects of EMRs on provider and patient behavior.",0,1,
701,The electronic prescription increases the acceptance of the recommendations of clinical pharmacologists in the hospital setting.,"OBJECTIVES To determine whether electronic prescribing facilitates the adoption of clinical pharmacologists' recommendations to improve drug safety in hospitalized medical patients. METHODS Four junior and four senior clinical pharmacologists studied the electronic medical records and prescription tables (either electronic or paper) of 502 patients hospitalized in medical wards at a large Swiss university hospital between January 2009 and January 2010. drug-related problems and interventions were proposed. The implementation and time delays of these proposed interventions were compared between patients for whom paper medical records were used and patients for whom electronic medical records were used. RESULTS A total of 158 medication-related problems were identified in 109 hospital admissions and 145 recommendations were made, of which 51% were met. Admissions with an electronic prescription chart (n = 90) were found to be 2.74 times more likely to implement the change than those with a paper prescription chart (n = 53) (95% confidence interval 1.2 , 6.3, P = 0.018, adjusted for any dependency introduced by patient, ward, or clinical team"";"" two cases are missing follow-up). The delay time between the formulation of the recommendations and their implementation (if any) was minimal (median 1 day) and did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Electronic prescribing in this hospital setting was associated with greater implementation of clinical pharmacologists' recommendations to improve medication safety compared with electronic prescribing.",0,1,
702,"Individualized, computer-generated, and electronically distributed feedback enhances the use of a computerized practice guide","Clinical guidelines have been developed to assist with patient care management"";"" however, these guidelines are frequently neglected in clinical practice. Computer-generated reminders improve guideline use, but these systems often fail to achieve high guideline utilization rates. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that individualized computer-generated feedback regarding adherence to care guidelines will significantly improve clinicians' compliance with guideline recommendations presented through a computer-assisted management protocol. . Half of 45 primary care physicians employed at a primary care clinic affiliated with an academic medical center were randomly assigned to receive a biweekly email message consisting of a computer-generated report summarizing their response to recommendations for care guidelines for diabetic patients cared for. during the previous 2 weeks. Physician compliance with guideline recommendations was the primary outcome measure. This study demonstrated that the intervention significantly increased clinicians' adherence to guideline recommendations without incurring high maintenance costs. Mean compliance among the intervention group was 35% versus 6.1% among the control group (p < 0.01). Individualized, computer-generated, and electronically distributed feedback regarding physician use of care guideline recommendations is an effective way to improve adherence to a care guideline.",0,1,
703,Email for clinical communication between health professionals,"BACKGROUND: Email is one of the most widely used communication methods, but its use in health care is still rare. Where email communication has been used in healthcare, its purposes have included clinical communication between healthcare professionals, but the effects of using email in this way are not well understood. We updated a 2012 review on the use of email for two-way clinical communication between health professionals. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of email for clinical communication between health professionals on health professional outcomes, patient outcomes, health service performance, and service efficiency and acceptability, compared with other ways of communicating clinical information. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: Cochrane Consumer and Communication Review Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 9 2013), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to August 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to August 2013), and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). Gray literature was searched: thesis/dissertation repositories, essay registries, and Google Scholar (searched November 2013). Additional search methods were used: review of reference lists and contact with authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies that examined interventions in which health professionals used email to communicate clinical information in the form of: 1) email non-secure email, 2) secure email, or 3) web messaging. All health professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information and all measures were reported as per study report. MAIN RESULTS: The previous version of this review included a randomized controlled trial with 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers at baseline. It compared an email to physicians that contained patient-specific osteoporosis risk information and guidelines for assessment and treatment versus usual care (no email). This study was at high risk of bias in the allocation concealment and blinding domains. The email reminder significantly changed the actions of healthcare professionals, with providers more likely to provide guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment (bone density measurement or osteoporosis medication, or both) compared with with usual care. Evidence of its impact on patients' behaviors or actions was inconclusive. One measure found that the electronic medical reminder message had a positive impact on patient behavior (patients had a higher calcium intake), and two found no difference between the two groups. The study did not assess the outcomes or harms of health services. No new studies were identified for this update.

Emergency nurses working in accident and emergency departments or as part of crisis intervention teams will see refugees and asylum seekers who self-harm at the very point of their distress. This clinical document is intended to assist nurses in their practice in the event that they encounter an adult asylum seeker in need of emergency mental health care. Practical strategies are highlighted to help mental health nurses assess, care for, and comfort refugees and asylum seekers in this situation. Mental health nurses should, where possible, work closely with asylum seekers, their support workers, and accredited interpreters and translators to ensure the appropriate use of language when dealing with non-isolating mental and emotional health issues. plus the asylum seeker of the appropriate services. To help strengthen the continuity and integration of mental health supports for refugees and asylum seekers, well-resourced care should be experienced as coherent and connected.

METHOD: A random sample of 45 physicians was distributed among three study groups. One group was visited by an 'empowered patient', one group's electronic health record was supplemented by a CDSS, and one group served as a control group. Simulated patients (PS) assessed the performance of GPs in daily practice before and after the interventions, using a validated 48-item checklist. RESULTS: The mean initial score of the 43 physicians was 26.16 (SD = 5.76). PS received sufficient information on correct pill use, but not on factors associated with pill failure and drug interaction. After the intervention, the physicians' mean score was 26.39 (SD = 6.86).

707,It seems possible to encourage post-stroke patients to be active: results of an intervention study with knowledge brokers,"PURPOSE: Although physical activity and exercise for stroke patients are highly recommended for speedy recovery, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centers are not sufficiently encouraged to be physically active. In this study, we investigated the impact of knowledge brokers (KB), enterprising nurses and therapists, on the performance of health professionals (HPs) to encourage hospitalized stroke patients to be physically active. METHOD: This multicenter intervention study used a pre-post test design. Two to three KBs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by patients and PS before and after the KB intervention. The primary outcome was encouragement provided by HCPs to their patients to be physically active, as reported by patients and HCPs. RESULTS: After the KB intervention, many more patients (48%""; N=217) reported at least some encouragement by PS to be physically active than before (26%;"" N=243, p<0.000). . HPs (N = 288) on average reported encouraging patients more often after the intervention, but this difference was significant only for occupational therapists and KBs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on patient reports of HP behavior, the KB intervention appears effective as more patients were encouraged to be physically active after the intervention compared to before. Replication of this study in an experimental design is needed to allow causal inferences. Implications for rehabilitation We advise rehabilitation teams to make use of knowledge brokers (KBs), as the KB intervention has been shown to increase the encouragement felt by stroke patients to be physically active. It seems worthwhile to involve doctors, nurses, and patients' families more frequently in efforts to encourage stroke patients to be physically active.",0,0,
708,Improved implementation of low back pain guidelines in general practice: study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines can improve treatment quality, but uptake of guideline recommendations is often incomplete and slow. Recently, new guidelines for low back pain are being released in Denmark. The guidelines are seen as reducing personal and public costs. The aim of this study is to assess whether a complex, multifaceted guideline implementation strategy for low back pain will reduce referral to secondary care and improve patient outcomes compared to the usual simple implementation strategy. METHODS/DESIGN: In a two-arm cluster-randomized trial, 100 general practices (clusters) and 2700 patients aged 18 to 65 years from the northern region of Denmark will be included. Practices are randomly assigned 1:1 to a simple or complex implementation strategy. Intervention practices will receive a complex implementation strategy, including guideline facilitator visits, stratification tools, and quality reporting on low back pain treatment. The primary outcome is referral to secondary care. Secondary outcomes are pain, physical function, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction with care and treatment outcome, employment status, and sick leave. Primary and secondary outcomes pertain to the patient level. Outcome assessments are blinded and follow the intention-to-treat principle. Additionally, a process evaluation will assess the degree to which elements of the intervention will be delivered as planned, as well as measure changes in beliefs and behaviors among GPs and patients. DISCUSSION: This study provides insight into the process and effect of an intervention to implement low back pain guidelines in general practice, and will provide information on essential elements to include in future implementation strategies in general practice.

709,Increased physician adherence to antibiotic use guidelines through increased availability of guidelines at the time of ordering medications in the hospital setting.,"Purpose Some studies have shown that making practice guidelines accessible to clinicians when making clinical decisions could improve prescribing practices. The aim of the study was to assess the benefit impact on physician adherence of the intervention of incorporating previously paper-based antibiotic guidelines into a university hospital's computerized drug order entry system to make these guidelines available. of physicians at the time of ordering antibiotics. Before the intervention, these guidelines were available in booklet form on all hospital wards. Methods Guideline compliance was assessed in 471 consecutive orders of antibiotics for pneumonia, 104 just before and 367 just after the intervention. The evaluation criteria were: the choice of antibiotic in relation to the context of acquisition of pneumonia, the daily dose, the expected duration of treatment. Assessment of antibiotic orders was performed at the start of antibiotic treatment. Results The intervention was followed by a significant decrease in the proportion of antibiotic requests that contained at least one criterion of nonconformity with the guidelines, respectively, 33% after vs. 51% (p?<?0.001) before the intervention. The proportion of nonconforming orders decreased in the postintervention period versus the preintervention period for the daily dose of antibiotics, respectively, 12.2% versus 26.9% (p?<?0.001), for the planned duration of treatment, respectively, 7.3% vs. 18.3% (p?<?0.001), while for the choice of antibiotics in relation to the context of acquired pneumonia, the improvement did not reach statistical significance, respectively, 18.2% vs. 25% (p?=?0.12). Conclusion In this study, the greater availability of antibiotic guidelines at the time of requesting the medication, combined with a periodic reinforcing educational round, was associated with greater physician adherence to these guidelines.

710,Improving access to pharmacotherapy and treatment for alcohol use disorder in primary care settings: ADaPT-PC,"Background Only 7.8% of people who meet the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment in a given year. Most people with AUD are identified in primary care (PC) settings and referred to substance use disorder (SUD) clinics"";"" however, only a minority of those referred attend treatment services. There are safe and effective drug treatments for AUD, but they are rarely prescribed by PC providers. The goal of this study is to refine, implement, and evaluate an intervention to integrate AUD pharmacological treatment options in CP settings. This document provides a detailed description of the intervention design and the components of the evaluation. Methods/Design Three large Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities are participating in the intervention. The intervention targets stakeholder groups with tailored strategies based on implementation theory and prior research that identifies barriers to implementation of AUD pharmacotherapy. Local SUD providers and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers are trained to serve as local implementation/clinical champions and receive external facilitation. PC providers receive access to local and national clinical champion consultations, educational materials, and an AUD patient dashboard on their cases for case identification. Veterans diagnosed with AUD receive educational information in the mail just prior to a scheduled PC visit. The efficacy of the intervention will be assessed through an interrupted time series with matched controls to monitor change in AUD pharmacotherapy prescription rates at the center level. Following Stetler's four-phase formative evaluation (FE) strategy, FE methods include (1) developmental FE (pre-deployment interviews with champions, PC vendors, and veterans), (2) deployment-focused FE (tracking attendance at facilitation meetings, academic efforts detailing local champions, and utilization of the patient dashboard), (3) Progress-Focused EF (AUD pharmacotherapy prescription follow-up rates and referral rates to specialized care PCMHI and SUD), and (4) interpretive FE (post-implementation interviews with champions and PC providers). Analysis of FE data will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Discussion If proven successful, this implementation strategy will provide a replicable, feasible, and relatively low-cost method of integrating AUD treatment services into PC settings, thereby increasing access to AUD treatment.",0,0,
711,Improving evidence-based diabetes and chronic disease management among local health departments: a multiphase dissemination study with a stepped cluster randomized trial component,"Background Rates of diabetes and prediabetes in the US are increasing, significantly affecting the quality and length of life of those diagnosed and placing an economic burden on society. Premature death and disability can be prevented through the implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPP). Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement EBPPs for diabetes management due to their knowledge of and focus on community-level needs, contexts, and resources. However, there is a significant gap between known diabetes management EBPPs and actual diabetes management activities performed by LHDs. The purpose of this study is to determine how best to support the use of evidence-based public health for the management of diabetes (and related chronic diseases) among public health professionals at the local level. Methods/Design This document describes the methods for a two-phase study with a staggered cluster-randomized trial that will evaluate dissemination strategies to increase the uptake of public health knowledge and EBPPs for diabetes management among LHDs. Phase 1 includes the development of measures to assess physician views and organizational support for evidence-based public health, data collection using a national online survey of LHD chronic disease physicians, and a health care needs assessment. factors influencing adoption of EBPP for diabetes management among LHDs within a state in the US Phase 2 is to conduct a stepped cluster randomized trial to assess the efficacy of outreach strategies with local professionals in LHDs to improve capacity and organizational support for evidence-based diabetes prevention and management. Twelve LHDs will be selected and randomly assigned to one of three usual practice crossover groups to receive the intervention strategies (diffusion) at 8-month intervals"";"" the duration of the intervention for the groups ranged from 8 to 24 months. Intervention (outreach) strategies may include multi-day face-to-face workshops, electronic information exchange methods, technical assistance through a knowledge broker, and organizational changes to support evidence-based public health approaches. Evaluation methods include surveys at baseline and three crossover time points, abstraction of diabetes and chronic disease control program plans and progress reports at the local level, and social network analysis to understand contextual relationships and issues that influence the adoption of the EBPP.",0,1,
712,Improving referral for mammograms in primary care,"Background. This 1-year randomized trial tested the efficacy of behavioral techniques in increasing referrals for mammography by primary care physicians in small community practices. Methods. Sixty-one practices were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) education-only control, (2) education plus cues enhancement using mammography chart stickers, and (3) education plus cues enhancement plus feedback and token rewards. Quarterly chart audits of a defined sample (N= 11,716) of female patients 50 years of age and older were conducted to document referrals, completions, and compliance with mammograms. Results. Referral and completion rates increased from baseline to the first trimester and gradually decreased thereafter. In general, these rates were higher in the indication conditions than in the control condition. In contrast, compliance rates in both experimental conditions increased throughout the year while remaining static in the control condition, demonstrating a strong and continuous effect for signal enhancement. Compliance increases were greater for physicians who were older, nonwhite, with a second specialty, in individual practice, not AMA members, not residency-trained, and not board-certified. Conclusions. Chart decals can significantly increase mammography utilization in small community practices. These practices are an efficient route to reach the large number of older women who need a mammogram.",1,1,
713,Enhancing the African Bioethics Initiative,"BACKGROUND: Medical ethics has existed since the time of Hippocrates. However, formal training in bioethics was not consolidated until a few decades ago. Bioethics has gained a strong foothold in the health sciences in the developed world, especially in Europe and North America. The situation is quite different in many developing countries. In most African countries, bioethics, as it is established and practiced today in the West, does not exist or is rudimentary. DISCUSSION: Although bioethics has come of age in developed and some developing countries, it is still largely ""foreign"" in most African countries. In some parts of Africa, a few bioethics conferences have been held in the last decade to raise awareness of research ethics and ensure compliance with international guidelines for research involving human participants. This idea has arisen in recognition of the genuine need to develop the capacity to review research ethics in Africa. It is also a condition required by external sponsors of collaborative research in Africa. The awareness and interest that these conferences have generated should be strengthened and extended beyond research ethics to clinical practice. In general, bioethics education in schools that train physicians and other health care providers is the hook that anchors both research ethics and clinical ethics. ABSTRACT: This communication reviews the current situation of bioethics in Africa in its application to research ethics workshops and proposes that, despite current efforts to integrate ethics in biomedical research in Africa, much remains to be done. to make it. A more comprehensive approach to bioethics with comprehensive benefit is to incorporate formal ethics education into health training institutions in Africa.",0,0,
714,Improvement of the algorithm for surveillance and screening of developmental-behavior in children aged 0 to 5 years,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics developmental screening and surveillance algorithm is adequate or whether revisions are needed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to investigate a physician's ability to perform developmental and behavioral surveillance in children aged 0 to 5 years. RESULTS: Even when a broadband developmental test is typical, pediatricians should refer when they confidently suspect a delay but are much more suspicious of children who appear asymptomatic. Regular screening improves surveillance by improving eligibility rates for early detection and early intervention (EI). However, children with worrying screens are not consistently referred to and interrelated with EI. Once referred, approximately half are considered ineligible for IE, despite typically performing well below average and having numerous predictive academic and psychosocial risk factors. Meanwhile, doctors struggle with keeping track of children at risk. CONCLUSION: Reviews are needed to optimize early detection, prevention, and follow-up. Greater emphasis is needed on developmental and behavioral promotion and coordination of referral care.",0,0,
715,Improving the quality of antibiotic prescription in primary care: qualitative evaluation of a blended learning intervention,"BACKGROUND: The Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) educational program aims to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing and raise awareness of antibiotic resistance among general practitioners. It consists of a seven-part theory-based blended learning program that includes online reflection on clinicians' own practice, presentation of evidence and research guidelines, a practice-based seminar focusing on prescribing participants' own antibiotics and resistance rates in urine samples sent from their practice, training in communication skills using videos of simulated patients in routine surgeries, and participation in a web forum. Efficacy was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial involving 244 GPs and nurse practitioners and 68 general practices. This article reports part of the process evaluation of that trial. METHODS: Semi-structured, digitally recorded, and transcribed telephone interviews with 31 intentionally sampled trial participants analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Most participants reported increased awareness of antibiotic resistance, increased self-confidence to reduce antibiotic prescribing, and at least some change in consultation style and antibiotic prescribing behavior. Reported practice changes included the adoption of a practice-wide antibiotic prescribing reduction policy. Many GPs also reported a better understanding of patient expectations, which ultimately contributed to an improved doctor-patient relationship. The intervention components proposed as most influential in changing medical behavior were up-to-date research evidence resources, simple and effective communication skills presented in online videos, and presentation of the organization's own antibiotic prescription levels. practice combined with an overview of local resistance data. CONCLUSION: Participants found this complex blended learning intervention acceptable and feasible, and reported far-reaching positive changes in attitudes and clinical practice as a result of participating in the STAR Education Program.

717,"Epidemiology of Presenile Alzheimer's Dementia in Scotland, 1974-88","OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiology of presenile Alzheimer's disease in Scotland from 1974 to 1988. DESIGN Retrospective review of hospital records of patients aged less than 73 years admitted to a psychiatric hospital with various diagnoses of dementia. Diagnoses were classified according to the criteria of the National Institute of Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Association of Alzheimer's Diseases and Related Disorders and the Hachinski score. The completeness of the study sample was assessed by scrutinizing general hospital and neurology outpatient records. SETTING All general psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. SUBJECTS All patients with onset of dementia between 40-64 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Probable and extensive Alzheimer's disease, patient sex, age of onset. RESULTS We reviewed 5,874 psychiatric hospital records, 129 neurology outpatient records, and 89 non-psychiatric hospital records. 317 patients met the criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, 569 met the criteria for extensive Alzheimer's disease, and 267 met the criteria for multi-infarct dementia. The lowest incidences per 100,000 population aged 40 to 64 years were 22.6 (95% confidence interval, 20.2 to 25.2) and 40.5 (38.9 to 42.3) per 100,000 for the probable and extensive Alzheimer's disease. In the 1981 census year, the annual incidence of probable Alzheimer's disease was 1.6 (1.0 to 2.6). Women were at higher risk with probable Alzheimer's disease incidence rates of 28.2 (24.5 to 32.4) per 100,000 compared with 16.5 (13.8 to 19.8) per 100,000 for the men. The incidence per 100,000 of multi-infarct dementia was higher in men (25.1, 23.3 to 27.1) than in women (13.4, 12.1 to 14.8). CONCLUSION Female sex appears to be positively associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease before the age of 65 years.",0,0,

720,ESHRE Guide: Routine Psychosocial Care in Infertility and Medically Assisted Reproduction: A Guide for Fertility Staff,"STUDY QUESTION: Based on the best evidence available in the literature, what is the optimal management of routine psychosocial care in infertility and medically assisted reproduction (MAR) clinics? SUMMARY RESPONSE: Using the structured methodology of the Manual for the Development of Guidelines of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), 120 recommendations were formulated that answered the 12 key questions on the optimal management of routine psychosocial care by the of all fertility staff. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: The 2002 ESHRE Guidelines for infertility counseling have been a benchmark for the best psychosocial care in infertility for years, but this guideline needed updating and did not focus on the routine psychosocial care it can provide all fertility staff. STUDY, DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This guideline was developed by a group of experts in the field according to the 12-step process outlined in the ESHRE Manual for guideline development. After determining the scope of the guideline and listing a set of 12 key questions in PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) format, comprehensive and systematic literature searches were conducted"";"" Evidence from articles published up to April 2014 was collected, quality assessed and analysed. An evidence summary was written in response to each of the key questions and used as the basis for the recommendations, which were defined by consensus within the guideline development group (GDG). Additional clinical and patient input was collected during the scoping and review phase of guideline development. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The guideline group, consisting of psychologists, two physicians, a midwife, a patient representative, and a methodology expert, met three times to discuss the evidence and reach consensus on recommendations. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE GUIDANCE PROVIDES: 120 recommendations that aim to guide fertility clinic staff in providing optimal evidence-based routine psychosocial care to patients facing infertility and MAR. The guide is written in two sections. The first section describes patients' preferences regarding the psychosocial care they would like to receive at the clinics and how this care is associated with their well-being. The second section of the guide provides information on the psychosocial needs patients experience throughout their treatment (before, during and after treatment) and how fertility clinic staff can detect and address these. Needs refer to the conditions that are assumed to be necessary for patients to have a healthy experience of fertility treatment. Needs can be behavioral (lifestyle, exercise, nutrition, and compliance), relational (relationship with partner, if any, family friends and wider network, and work), emotional (well-being, for example, anxiety , depression, and quality of life) and Cognitive (treatment concerns and knowledge). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We identified many areas in care for which strong evidence was lacking. Gaps in the evidence were addressed through the formulation of good practice points, based on the expert opinion of the GDG, but it is essential that such recommendations are empirically validated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The evidence presented in this guideline shows that providing routine psychosocial care is associated with or has the potential to reduce stress and concerns about medical procedures and improve lifestyle outcomes, knowledge related to fertility, patient well-being and adherence to treatment. . Since only 45 (36.0%) of the 125 recommendations were based on high-quality evidence, the guideline group made recommendations to guide future research with the goal of increasing the body of evidence.",0,0,
721,Essential elements of an early care service in psychosis: the opinion of expert clinicians,"BACKGROUND: Early intervention teams attempt to improve outcome in schizophrenia through earlier detection and provision of phase-specific treatments. While the number of early intervention teams is growing, there is a lack of clarity about their essential structural and functional elements. METHODS: A 'Delphi' exercise was carried out to identify the extent to which there was consensus on the essential elements of early intervention teams in a group of 21 UK medical experts. Using published guidelines, an initial list was constructed containing 151 items from ten categories of team structure and function. RESULTS: There was overall expert consensus on the importance of 136 (90%) of these items. Of the items on which there was consensus, 106 (70.2%) were classified as essential, which means that, in their absence, the functioning of the team would be seriously affected. CONCLUSION: This degree of consensus on essential elements suggests that it is reasonable to define a model for UK early intervention teams from which a measure of fidelity could be derived.",0,0,
722,Fundamentals of research ethics for health professionals,"Whether conducted at a university or in the health field, human subjects research raises a multitude of ethical questions for health professionals. As they engage in continuing professional development on how to conduct ethical research, clinicians and scientists alike need to expand their knowledge to provide answers to the following questions: What ethical theories serve as the basis for ethical principles in research ethics ? What ethical principles must a researcher respect when conducting research with human subjects? What does it mean to conduct research ethically? What ethical dilemmas does a researcher face when conducting research? This document provides a review of ethical theories and the ethical basis for guidelines developed and used to guide research involving human subjects. Ethical behaviors and personal responsibility of the researcher conducting research involving human subjects are discussed along with ethical considerations in research designs and methods.",0,0,
723,Establishing translational and clinical cancer research collaborations between high- and low-income countries,"Both infectious and noninfectious disease-related malignancies are a growing problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is difficult to extrapolate cancer care data and guidelines from high-income countries (HICs) to cancer patients in LMICs. Due to rising rates of noncommunicable cancer, there is a growing gap between the need for evidence-based treatments for cancer control plans and existing research capabilities. Surgeons frequently provide all surgical and medical oncology treatments for LMIC patients for diseases such as breast, gastric, cervical, and colorectal cancer. However, clinical and translational research collaborations in surgical oncology are lacking. There are several successful consortia focusing on HIV and infection-related malignancies. These collaborations can be used as examples for future surgical research efforts. The collaboration between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Nigeria, which focuses on colorectal cancer, is used as an example of how to initiate a research collaboration that can build research infrastructure and provide the data needed to generate realistic treatment guidelines . The need for further research in surgical oncology and the growing population of patients with non-infectious malignancies in LMICs has created a unique opportunity for surgeons to initiate and lead translational and clinical research collaborations between HIC and LMIC.",0,0,
724,Ethical aerobics: ACHRE's flight from responsibility,"The President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) was charged with conducting a comprehensive ethical review of radiation experiments funded by the US government. Several hundred thousand people were used as experimental subjects in these experiments in several thousand experiments. This document reviews the ACHRE Final Report, issued in October 1995. ACHRE did not recommend apologies or compensation to the vast majority of victims. His rationale for this decision was riddled with inconsistencies. When the facts could not be recontextualized to reduce the apparent misconduct of the government-funded researchers, ACHRE created ethical loopholes to avoid prosecuting the perpetrators. We criticized ACHRE's recommendations through careful analysis of its own records and transcripts.

The second goal may be in conflict with the first. IRBs have the primary responsibility to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects. Although the IRB system is not perfect, conscientious IRBs assure the public that the rights and welfare of human subjects are taken seriously by people who have no vested interest in the outcome of the research. In exercising their responsibilities, IRBs promote the protection of human subjects. IRB approval provides a significant affirmation of the scientific and ethical qualities of the research and thus offers important validation for research and research investigators.

726,Ethical and legal risks associated with archival research,"Mental health facilities and professionals commonly allow researchers direct access to patient records for research archiving purposes without the informed consent of patient-participants. These investigators generally have access to all information in such records as long as they agree to keep it confidential and to remove any identifying information from subsequent investigative reports. Changes to the Ethical Principles of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 1992) raise ethical and legal issues that require consideration by practitioners, researchers, and facility Institutional Review Boards. This article addresses these issues and provides recommendations for changes in ethical standards, as well as alternative avenues for conducting research using archival mental health records.",0,0,
727,Ethical complications of therapeutic clinical research in children,"The usual discussion of ethicists and physicians about the ethical implications of research on children with catastrophic illnesses and the guidelines established by the Federal Government for this research are based on the application of general moral principles to the problems. Whatever the merits of this approach to policy making, it does not adequately reflect the life situation of patients and the complexity of a single regimen that is simultaneously therapeutic and research-oriented. Furthermore, issues become more complex when there is disagreement between parents about the course of treatment. Our argument is that such cases are adequately resolved considering the degree of paternalism that the clinician-researcher must exercise."";"" KIE: Much of the discussion of ethical issues in therapeutic research with children is based on the application of general moral principles to categories of problems. The authors believe that this approach does not adequately address the complexity of a treatment regimen for children with catastrophic illness that is both therapeutic and research-oriented.

729,Ethical considerations in recruiting research subjects from inpatient cardiovascular patient populations,"Cardiovascular research nurses play an important role in ensuring that subject recruitment is conducted in an ethically defensible manner. However, these nurses encounter many ethical challenges in the course of research. Exclusive reliance on regulatory mechanisms, such as institutional review board oversight and compliance with legal requirements, does not necessarily ensure the protection of human subjects or the scientific integrity of researchers (J Law Med Ethics. 2002""; ""30:411-419). Therefore, this article discusses 3 additional ethical considerations associated with recruiting hospitalized cardiovascular patients for research studies.

732,Ethical aspects in the management of chronic non-malignant pain,"Chronic pain represents a challenge for patients, families, employers, and physicians who care for these individuals. Opioids remain the mainstay of analgesic medications for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Controlled-release preparations of morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and long-acting opioid agents, such as methadone and levorphanol, have been medically and ethically accepted for the treatment of chronic cancer pain. However, the continued use of these drugs for patients with chronic non-cancer pain has been the subject of intense debate. This article attempts to reconcile the medical and ethical dilemma of using opioid medications for chronic non-cancer pain. Growing clinical experience in the field of pain medicine has helped to clarify: (1) the misunderstanding of addiction, physical dependence, and tolerance to analgesics, (2) the misconception that chronic opioid therapy inevitably It causes personality changes, depression, and cognitive and physical decline. (3) the lack of information on the correct use of opioid analgesics with regard to titration and management of related side effects. The behavioral management of pain patients undergoing chronic opioid therapy is also discussed. A protocol for optimal patient management is proposed. Special emphasis is placed on the consent form, contracting behavior and the consequences of non-compliance. The importance of psychological evaluation before a long-term opioid trial is highlighted, to minimize future complications. Although most patients on the opioid regimen do well, special attention should be given to patients with current addiction, a history of addiction, or current misuse of opioid medications. Pharmacological and conservative interventions are often warranted in those patients with significant behavioral problems. If such strategies fail and chronic opioid therapy is deemed necessary, some treatment guidelines are offered.",0,0,
733,Ethical standards for innovative surgery: the last frontier?,"BACKGROUND: There are no clear federal regulations governing innovative surgery, although there are general guidelines governing research involving human subjects. We presume that American surgeons are unaware of Department of Health and Human Services regulations, rarely seek IRB review, generally oppose external regulation of innovative surgery, and are unsure of what constitutes innovation and research. These circumstances, if true, would pose a significant ethical issue and pose potential harm to patients as unwitting research subjects. STUDY DESIGN: In a pilot study, we reviewed 527 issues of US surgical and medical journals, selecting 59 articles published between 1992 and 2000 that described innovative surgery. Corresponding authors from university hospitals (71%) and other facilities (29%) were sent an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: The survey was conducted between November 2000 and May 2001. Twenty-one questionnaires were returned, complete with responses, constituting an overall response rate of 35%. Fourteen authors confirmed that their work was research, but only six had sought prior IRB review. Most authors (15 of 21) did not submit their protocol to the IRB. Only seven authors mentioned the innovative nature of the procedure in the informed consent form. Seven authors stated that they were familiar with the Office for the Protection of Human Research definitions of research and the human subject. Two thirds of the respondents stated that government regulations for the protection of human subjects from innovative surgery would not be appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The current system of definitions, ethical theories, and voluntary professional guidelines may be inadequate to meet the challenge of surgical innovation. Additional research is proposed to examine the adequacy of existing guidelines.",0,0,
734,Ethical requirements to be met before the introduction of new procedures,"For orthopedic patient care to continue to improve, new approaches, both diagnostic and therapeutic, must continually be developed. To verify that a new approach actually provides better results, these innovations must undergo rigorous scientific study. However, because the results of clinical interventions can only be studied in human subjects, these studies must not only meet scientific criteria, but must also meet strict ethical criteria. The Declaration of Helsinki, a document prepared by the World Medical Association that was originally written in 1964, substantially revised in 1975, and most recently revised in 1996, provides guidelines for such studies. In addition to complying with ethical requirements, clinical investigators also face a number of complex issues that must be addressed in conducting clinical research studies. One of the most difficult issues is the conflict between a physician's concern for the welfare of his patients and the need for protocol-based trials. No matter how enthusiastic surgeons may be about a new therapeutic approach, they must recognize that they are responsible for scientifically validating their innovative approach with a well-controlled clinical trial using valid functional outcome measures.",0,0,

While the American and Canadian evaluation societies provide important guidelines and standards for evaluation professionals, research ethics boards provide processes for accountability to the public.

The existing pluralism in the philosophical background on which contemporary bioethical theories are developed is seriously questioning the old traditions of Hippocratic, non-utilitarian medical ethics, trying to promote more utilitarian and secular approaches. Individual clinicians or researchers, as well as the ethics committee itself, today face difficult ethical dilemmas, which often have to be resolved in an environment of considerable social, academic, economic, and time pressures, and sometimes without guidance. useful of the appropriate ones. legislation. An interesting possibility for how to overcome some of the pitfalls of the ethical review process is to express a common ethical responsibility for the research project or trial protocol in a statement by most (or all) of the parties involved (such as the principal investigator, sponsor, ethics committee, the patient, ""society""). This approach has proven useful in improving the concrete deliberations of the ethics committees established in Slovakia since 1991 in accordance with the requirements of the national guidelines issued by the Slovak Ministry of Health.",0,0,
737,Ethics committees and pediatric research: a personal look,"Surveillance of clinical research involving children, or tissues taken from them, continues to become more formalized and sophisticated. It can be expected that many physicians and most pediatricians will be offered the opportunity to serve on pediatric Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs) at some point in their professional lives. Bold and independent ethics committees have considerable influence on both the design and implementation of clinical research and the topics of permissible research in which infants and children will participate. The composition of IECs is generally designed to provide a balance of gender, professional background, and institutional and non-institutional affiliations. In addition to these now well-established compositional guidelines, IECs that award pediatric research have a pragmatic requirement for three additional specific roles: those of in loco parentis, in loco infanti, and the special role of nursing staff. These roles and the ethical basis for them are defined. Furthermore, the role in loco parentis is ethnically complex, and an IEC considering this role must be clear about its implications. Pediatric research projects involve not only specific risks inherent to the project in question, but also more general risks inherent to any clinical research intervention effort itself. Pediatric IECs should act as a mode of encouragement, rather than simply 'medical observers', and should insist ab initio on publication of results as a condition of permission to conduct the research in question. A particularly effective form of ethical audit is the national and international peer review that follows such publication of pediatric research. This report discusses these special issues in the evolving context of increased pediatric research surveillance.",0,0,
738,Ethics committees in Italy: a survey on a sample of oncologists,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: The mission of physicians and the purpose of clinical research can create a conflict between medical ethics and human rights. All recommendations, directives, and laws regarding experimental interventions require a formal protocol, Ethics Committee (EC) approval, and the written informed consent of potential participants. In Italy, in 1998 new guidelines on the handling of EC submissions were published. A year later, people involved in CE activities felt that the immediate impact of the new rules (ie decentralization and emphasis on pharmacological aspects of studies) was negative. A prospective study was launched to assess oncologists' opinions on the performance of the Italian CE. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was administered twice to 110 oncologists involved in two multicenter trials. Nine questions were included on the following aspects: presence of an EC at the hospital level, personal experience with an EC, average time required for the evaluation of the proposals presented, and level of satisfaction with the important functions of the EC. RESULTS: Responses were received from 93 (first survey) and 69 (second survey) physicians. In both surveys, physicians reported that they were satisfied with the scientific and ethical aspects of EC operation, but dissatisfied with educational and training activities, as well as bureaucratic and administrative requirements. In the second survey, the average time required for evaluation after the presentation of a study protocol was approximately 2.4 months and the level of dissatisfaction was still high for some critical aspects such as bureaucracy (44%) and activities educational and training (64%). . The analysis of change over time documented small differences (from -8% to +7%) in all aspects evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the present study, namely the small sample size and the intrinsic characteristics of the Italian environment, the findings add empirical evidence on the functioning of local EC and the opinions of clinical researchers. This experience confirms that empirical studies on medical ethics are feasible and can produce useful information to facilitate the implementation of EC in the medical and lay community.",0,0,

This unclear status and subsequent questionable applicability of existing federal guidelines for human subjects research raise an ethical concern. To clarify their position, we solicit American surgeons' definitions, opinions, and attitudes about innovative surgery. Surgeons were also invited to self-report their knowledge of current federal regulations guiding human subjects research and the rules for informed consent and IRB review of clinical research. STUDY DESIGN: A group of US surgeons were given a 46-item questionnaire addressing the definition of innovative vs. investigational surgery and practice, regulations for research involving human subjects, the need for specific informed consent and the IRB review of surgical innovations. RESULTS: A total of 665 responses were used in the content analysis. Respondents expressed a fairly cautious stance in judging hypothetical innovative scenarios. The hallmarks of experimentation and clinical research as modes of innovation became more clearly defined for the surgical situation.

We present the ethical benefits and costs of the current practice of randomized clinical trials for four groups: patients participating in clinical trials, patients not participating in trials, participating physicians, and society. The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) approach is then introduced and practical measures are proposed to strike a positive balance between the ethical benefits and costs of randomized trials.",0,0,

Research is distinguished from ordinary clinical practice by the intention of advancing knowledge. Thus defined, research with psychiatric patients should be governed by the same four principles as research with any other group: knowledge, need, benefit and consent. However, in applying these principles, particularly the principle of consent, psychiatric patients present many acute difficulties. Several proposals to address these difficulties are discussed. It is suggested that, despite the value of published guidelines and the help that may be available from research ethics committees, the primary responsibility for maintaining high standards of research practice lies with the researchers themselves.",0,0,
743,"EUROASPIRE III: a survey of lifestyle, risk factors and the use of cardioprotective drug therapies in coronary patients from 22 European countries","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events III (EUROASPIRE III) survey was to determine whether the Joint European Societies guidelines on cardiovascular prevention are being followed in daily clinical practice and to describe the style of life, risk factor and therapeutic management in patients with coronary artery disease (CHD) in Europe. METHODS: The EUROASPIRE III survey was carried out in 2006-2007 in 76 centers in selected geographical areas in 22 countries in Europe. Consecutive patients, with a clinical diagnosis of CHD, were retrospectively identified and then followed up, interviewed, and examined at least 6 months after their coronary event. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred thirty-five medical records (27% women) were reviewed and 8966 patients were interviewed. At interview, 17% of patients smoked cigarettes, 35% were obese and 53% centrally obese, 56% had blood pressure > or = 140/90 mmHg (> or = 130/80 in people with diabetes mellitus), 51% had serum total cholesterol > or = 4.5 mmol/l and 25% reported a history of diabetes of which 10% had fasting plasma glucose less than 6.1 mmol/l and 35% a glycated hemoglobin A1c of less than 6.5%. The use of cardioprotective medication was: antiplatelets 91%""; beta-blockers 80%; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 71%""; calcium channel blockers 25% and statins 78%. CONCLUSION: The EUROASPIRE III survey shows that a large proportion of coronary patients do not achieve lifestyle, risk factors and therapeutic objectives for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. There are wide variations in the prevalence of risk factors and the use of cardioprotective pharmacological treatments between countries. There is still considerable potential across Europe to raise standards of preventive care in order to reduce the risk of recurrent disease and death in patients with CHD.",0,0,

745,Evaluation of an educational intervention to improve asthma treatment in four European countries. Drug Education Project Group,"In the international Drug Education Project, a new educational program for physician groups to improve the treatment of asthma patients was developed and tested in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Slovakia. Individualized feedback on prescribing and underlying decision strategy was presented and discussed within the group of physicians, relative to existing guidelines. In a parallel randomized controlled design, the effect on competition and actual prescribing was tested. The results were related to national guidelines. In general, the program improved physicians' attitudes as well as some of their prescribing behaviors. The proportion of patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids was significantly improved in the Netherlands (effect size 1.27), and the proportion using oral corticosteroids for treatment of exacerbations increased in both the Netherlands and Norway (effect sizes 1.99 and 0.87, respectively). General attitudes of Dutch and Norwegian doctors were also significantly improved (effect size 1.06 and 0.87, respectively), as were knowledge (effect size 1.06) and attitudes (effect size 1.49). ) regarding the treatment of exacerbations in Slovakia. In Sweden no significant improvements could be measured. In conclusion, improvements in asthma management are possible with an educational program based on self-study in small peer groups, although effects in one health care setting may not occur in another health care setting. Possible explanatory factors may be different attitudes and experiences with guidelines, as well as continuing medical education programs, and differences in opportunities for change, including prevailing trends in prescribing behaviour.",0,0,
746,"Evaluation of computer applications: some alternative approaches: theory, social interactionism and call for methodological pluralism","review of the evaluation literature on CDSS indicates that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the 'gold standard' for evaluation. While this approach is excellent for studying clinical or system performance, it is not well suited to answering questions about whether or how the systems will be used. As the lack of use of CDSS has been a concern for some years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address these issues. This paper critiques RCTs and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative approaches to evaluation that address questions outside the scope of typical RCTs and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of assessments that take into account social, organizational, professional, and contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of system performance or physician behavior by focusing on the 'fit' of the system with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Because there is little explicit theory informing many assessments, the paper then reviews CDSS assessments informed by social science theory. Finally, it proposes a theoretical basis for the social sciences of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It is a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, attention and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the evaluation approach is also useful for the implementation of clinical guidelines and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, although the discussion is about social interactionism, the most important point is the need to broaden assessment through a variety of methods and approaches that investigate social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can increase understanding of many influences related to the development and implementation of computer applications.",0,0,
747,Assessing the Efficacy of a Clinical Practice Change Intervention to Increase the Provision of Preventive Care by Physicians in a Community-Based Mental Health Services Network: A Study Protocol from an Initial Multiple Nonrandomized Trial,"BACKGROUND: People with a mental illness experience substantial health disparities, including higher rates of morbidity and mortality from potentially preventable chronic conditions. One factor contributing to such a disparity is a higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviors, such as smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, harmful use of alcohol, and inadequate physical activity. Evidence supports the effectiveness of preventive care in reducing these risks, and the guidelines recommend that preventive care that addresses these risks be incorporated into routine clinical care. Although community-based mental health services represent an important potential setting for ensuring that people with mental illness receive such care, research suggests that their provision is currently suboptimal. A study will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention to increase the routine provision of preventive care by clinicians in community mental health settings. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-group multiple benchmark design will be used to assess the effectiveness of a multistrategic intervention implemented over 12 months to increase physician provision of preventive care. The intervention will be implemented sequentially across the two community mental health service clusters to increase provision of client assessment, brief counseling and referral for four health risk behaviors (smoking, inappropriate fruit and vegetable intake, harmful use of alcohol and inadequate physical activity). The outcome measures of interest will be collected through repeated cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted weekly for 36 months with community mental health clients. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategy clinical practice change intervention to increase clinicians' provision of routine preventive care for behavioral risk factors of chronic disease within a community service network. of mental health. The results will inform future policies and practices regarding the ability of clinicians within mental health settings to improve the provision of preventive care as a result of such interventions.

748,Evaluation of the efficacy of educational interventions to prevent delirium,"The aim of this study was to combine knowledge about how physicians learn with a review of educational interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalized patients. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of approaches to delirium education. A detailed search of educational and medical databases was performed. The type of intervention used was classified according to the PRECEED model by Green et al, using factors relevant to behavior change in health promotion. The effectiveness of the intervention was determined by assessing changes in staff performance and patient outcomes. Nineteen studies of variable design and quality were identified. Studies that used predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing strategies together were more effective in producing changes in staff behavior and patient outcomes. Education and guidelines used together or in combination have little effect. When strategies to enable and reinforce changes in clinical practice are used in conjunction with education sessions, outcomes for patients are more positive.",0,0,
749,Evaluation of the Stage of Change Model for a Cervical Cancer Screening Intervention Among Ohio Appalachian Women,"Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately high among women living in Appalachia, Ohio. This study used the transtheoretical model to examine screening barriers before and after lay health advisor (LHA) intervention (2005-2009) to increase cervical cancer screening rates. Ohio Appalachian women (n = 90) who required a Pap smear, based on risk-appropriate guidelines, were randomized to a 10-month LHA intervention and received two face-to-face visits, two phone calls, and four mailed postcards addressed to the participant's stage of change. The results revealed that 63% had a forward stage movement 10 months after the intervention. The most frequently reported barriers to screening were time constraints, forgetting to make an appointment, and cost. Women who reported the following barriers: ""doctor did not recommend the test""; not being able to pay for the test;"" and being embarrassed, nervous or afraid to get a Pap test, were less likely to be in the action stage. Understanding the stages of change related to Pap testing and the reported barriers among this underserved population can help inform researchers and clinicians about preparing this population for change and how to set realistic intervention goals.",0,0,
750,Assessing the Acceptance and Effects of the NHGDoc Computerized Decision Support System on Primary Care Quality: Protocol for a Large-Scale Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) are increasingly being used to improve quality of care. There is evidence of moderate to large effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but evidence on its effectiveness when implemented nationally is lacking. In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) started its successful guideline program 30 years ago. NHGDoc, a CDSS based on these NHG guidelines, which covers multiple disease areas for general practice, was developed in 2006 with the goal of improving the quality of primary care. In this document, a protocol for evaluating the acceptance and effects of NHGDoc is presented. METHODS: A group RCT will be conducted among 120 general practices in the Netherlands. Eligible general practitioners will be randomly assigned to receive NHGDoc's regular decision support modules (control arm) or regular modules plus an additional module on heart failure (intervention arm). The Heart Failure module consists of patient-specific alerts related to the management of heart failure patients. Effect evaluation will focus on performance indicators (eg, prescribing behavior) as well as patient outcomes (eg, hospital admissions) relevant to the heart failure domain. In addition, a process assessment will be conducted to gain insight into the barriers and facilitators that affect the uptake and impact of NHGDoc. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the uptake and impact of a CDSS covering multiple domains for primary care implemented by a national guideline organization to improve the quality of primary care. While the trial focuses on a specific domain of care, heart failure, the findings of this study will shed light on the performance of CDSS covering multiple disease areas for primary care, particularly as this study also explores factors that contribute to the acceptance and effectiveness of the system.

751,Evaluation of training methods to bring contingency management to therapists,"The effects of three increasingly intensive training methods on the therapist's use, knowledge, and implementation of contingency management (CM) with adolescent substance abusers were evaluated. Ten public sector mental health or substance abuse provider organizations were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: workshop and resources (WS+), WS+ and computer-assisted training (WS+/CAT), or WS+/CAT and supervision support (WS+/CAT/SS). Across all conditions, 161 therapists participated in the training experiences, and measurements were obtained at baseline and at 2-month intervals for 12 months after workshop participation. In all training conditions, therapists reported increased use, knowledge, and adherence to CM implementation throughout the 12-month follow-up. The findings show that community doctors are willing to adopt evidence-based treatments when given access to helpful resources. Furthermore, high-quality workshops in combination with access to resources can increase knowledge of evidence-based treatment and can improve adherence to the intervention to the level necessary to improve youth outcomes.",0,0,
752,Evaluation of a complex intervention to change professional behavior: the evidence-based trial (EBOR),"OBJECTIVES: To identify the effect of a complex intervention (educational outreach visits conducted by pharmacists) designed to change general practitioner (GP) prescribing at each step of a hypothetical change pathway leading to the final outcome of the primary trial of change in the prescription. METHOD: The study was carried out in six health authorities in the north of England and six in London. We describe three steps that lead to this result: general practices agree to participate""; physicians from each practice who attended the outreach visit conducted by pharmacists""; and physicians' prescribing practice is influenced by these visits. The results of each step were evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 102 randomly selected practices, 75 (73.5%) agreed to participate. The odds of all clinicians attending the outreach meeting in small practices (i.e. 1 or 2 partners) was 6.7 (95% CI 4.4 to 23.5) compared to other practices ( i.e. > 3 partners). Although pharmacists reported that they had established a good relationship in 100 (72%) first visits and had agreed management plans for 110 (79%) of these visits, they were confident that the practice would likely alter their prescription in only 41% of these visits. Pharmacists' and general practitioners' satisfaction with outreach visits did not necessarily lead to changes in prescribing after the practice visit, and general practitioners' knowledge of pharmacist-promoted guidelines did not necessarily translate into changes in prescribing. clinical practice. The main barriers to guideline implementation identified by pharmacists at follow-up visits were organizational difficulties, physician skepticism about the evidence presented to them, and physicians' lack of interest in changing their prescribing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study is limited by a post hoc rather than a pre hoc design, it provides a pragmatic approach to understanding the factors that influence the pathway of change in prescribing behavior in response to academic outreach visits.",0,0,

754,Evaluation of a dental public health program for retirees in Denmark,"High priority is given to improvements in the oral health of the elderly in Scandinavia. In 1987, a Danish municipality established a dental public health program for elderly retirees. All citizens aged 67 years were offered preventive and curative care at school using the guidelines and principles established by the Danish Municipal Dental Service for children. The care was provided free of charge. Citizens who do not wish to obtain care through the public system may do so through private dentists. Reimbursement for care obtained from the private system was provided by the National Health Insurance and the municipality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the program after three years of operation. A follow-up design was used and data collection was done through interviews and clinical records. At baseline and during follow-up, 216 (71%) and 235 (77%) pensioners, respectively, were interviewed about their self-assessments of dental health, dental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour. Clinical data was collected only for the elderly who participated in the public program and included 194 people at baseline and 187 at follow-up. These data included information on tooth loss, dental caries, periodontal health, and presence and function of removable dentures. At follow-up, 86 percent of all respondents had regular visits to the dentist at least once a year compared to 46 percent at baseline"";"" 75 percent participated in the public program and 11 percent obtained care from private doctors.

755,Evaluation of a diabetes treatment program in primary care guided by a diabetes specialist,"PURPOSE: An initial pilot program demonstrated promising results in improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and prompted us to test these findings in a controlled trial. The purpose of the diabetes-focused, algorithm-driven, mid-level physician-administered, electronically-led treatment program (DAMET-2) clinical trial was to investigate the benefits of a novel program for disseminating guidance in the treatment of diabetes. diabetes from a specialized clinical center to primary care centers with access to services from mid-level providers. DATA SOURCES: DAMET-2 included standardized treatment algorithms and education delivered through computer-assisted and traditional methods associated with telemedicine. Two primary care practices were selected, and subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes > or = 6 months, > or = 18 years of age with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (identified through chart review) were eligible for inclusion. Mid-level professionals of experimental group subjects (N = 34) received training in the American Diabetes Association treatment algorithms, had telephone consultations at 2- to 4-week intervals, and bi-monthly visits with diabetes specialists, and received treatment guidance within 24 hours from remote diabetes. Specialists Weekly diabetes clinics were made available to subjects in the experimental group. After 12 months, the latest available subject data was extracted from the subjects' medical records and compared with 12-month medical record data from a control group (N = 101) receiving no additional study services. . CONCLUSIONS: Mean HbA(1c) values decreased from baseline by 0.46% in the active treatment group versus 0.06% in the control group; however, the reductions in HbA(1c) did not reach statistical significance potentially due to the small sample size of the group. experimental group. Mean SBP values were significantly reduced in both groups; however, LDL-C was only significantly reduced in the control group, where more aggressive use of statins may have had an effect. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite Inconsistencies in risk factor reduction from the pilot program, the DAMET-2 program provided information on the importance of electronic records and provider notifications, patient adherence, prioritization of provider resources by level of risk factor among patients and access to education for self-management.",0,0,
756,Evaluation of a knowledge transfer scheme to improve the formulation of policies and practices in the framework of health promotion and disease prevention in French regions: a realistic study protocol,"Background Evidence-based decision-making and practice are essential in public health. However, the barriers persist and are related to the properties, organizations and contexts of the evidence. To address these important knowledge transfer (TK) issues, we need to rethink how knowledge is produced and used, to improve our understanding of decision-making processes, logics, and mechanisms, and to examine the capacity of public health services to Integrate research results into your decisions and operations. This article presents a realistic evaluation protocol to evaluate an AT scheme in prevention policy and practice at the local level in France. Methods/design This study is a comparative study of multiple cases, using a realistic approach, to evaluate an RT scheme in regional health agencies (ARS) and non-profit regional organizations for education and health promotion (IREPS) , through the analysis of the configurations contexts/mechanisms/results of the same. The assessed KT scheme is designed for the use of six reviews of systematic reviews on the following topics: nutrition, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, emotional and sexual life, and psychosocial skills. It combines the following activities: supporting the access and adaptation of scientific and usable evidence""; strengthening the skills of professionals to analyze, adopt and use evidence in the course of their practices and their decision-making process""; facilitating the use of evidence in organizations and processes. RAMESE II reporting standards were used for realistic assessments. Discussion The objectives of this study are to experiment with and characterize factors related to the scheme's ability to enable public health stakeholders to address AT challenges and integrate scientific knowledge into policy and practice. We will use the realist approach to document the parameters of successful RT strategies in the specific contexts of preventive health services in France, while seeking to determine the transferability of such strategies.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test this brief one-on-one training program with young doctors to explore its acceptability, feasibility, and effect on clinician confidence, communication skills, attitudes toward psychosocial care, and burnout. DESIGN: The content of the training intervention was informed by a systematic review of the literature and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding communication at the end of life. The intervention was based on sound educational principles and involved three one-hour teaching sessions over a three-week period, including two one-on-one sessions with an expert facilitator and a simulated patient/caregiver. In addition, participants received written and audiovisual learning materials to take home. PARTICIPANTS were videotaped consulting with a simulated patient/caregiver before and after the training to assess the impact of the course on their communication behaviors. PARTICIPANTS completed de-identified questionnaires before and after training, including self-assessment of confidence, attitudes towards psychosocial care, and the Maslach Burnout inventory. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS included 22 attending physicians from a large teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: All participants reported that the training was useful, it had been helpful in their communication with patients, and that they would recommend the training to others. Significant improvements were found in the communication skills of the participants (in seven of the 21 specific communication behaviors and in the three global ones evaluated, range P=0.02 to <0.001), confidence in communication on relevant topics (P< 0.001), attitudes towards psychosocial care (P=0.03) and sense of personal fulfillment (P=0.043).

758,Evaluation of a physician-focused educational intervention in Medicaid children with asthma,"BACKGROUND: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated drug utilization review in response to inappropriate drug use. In the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, pediatric asthma is associated with high health care utilization and cost. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a physician-focused educational intervention on asthma medication use and health care utilization. METHODS: A pre-post intervention comparison design was used for children 5 to 18 years of age who were enrolled in the Pennsylvania Medicaid fee-for-service program from July 1, 1998 through March 31, 1998. 1999 (before the intervention) and July 1, 1999. 1999, to March 31, 2000 (post-intervention). The intervention package included the patients' medication profiles, medical history, a national asthma management guideline monograph, and patient education materials for clinicians. The main outcome measures are changes in asthma medication use among heavy users of short-acting beta (2) agonists (SABs). RESULTS: The intervention focused on 2 criteria of asthma medication use: (1) high use of quick-relief medications and (2) use of salmeterol without the availability of a quick-relief medication. The intervention reduced quick-relief medication use by 26% among patients with the highest use without significant changes in long-term control medications. In addition, 82% of recipients evaluated had a positive change in salmeterol use, either because a SAB inhaler was added post-intervention or salmeterol was discontinued post-intervention. There were no significant changes in emergency department visits or hospitalizations related to asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Although the responding physicians agreed on the usefulness of the educational materials, the results suggest that the intervention had limited success in improving pharmacological management and no effect on health outcomes. We believe that educational materials mailed to physicians can be effective in changing prescribing behavior"";"" however, a more multifaceted intervention may be needed to improve health outcomes.",0,0,

Obesity is a chronic condition that carries a significant health risk. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2006) has published national guidelines, for use in England, on the treatment of overweight or obese people. The NICE recommendations for primary care teams are: determine the degree of overweight and obesity""; assess lifestyle, comorbidities and willingness to change; offer multicomponent management of overweight and obesity; refer to external services when This study investigates a tailored intervention to improve implementation of these recommendations by primary care teams.METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial.Primary care teams will be recruited from the East Midlands of England and will be randomized into two arms of the study: 1) the study arm, in which primary care teams are offered a set of tailored interventions to help implement the NICE guidelines for overweight and obesity;"" or 2) the control group in which primary care teams continue to practice usual care. The primary outcome is the proportion of overweight or obese patients for whom the primary care team adheres to the NICE guidelines.

760,Evaluation of a set of tools to improve the detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases in people with type 2 diabetes: protocol for a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: The gap between the level of care recommended by evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and the actual care provided to patients in practice has been well established. The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) created an implementation strategy to improve implementation of its 2008 guidelines. This study will assess the impact of the strategy in improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for people with diabetes. DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster-randomized trial will be conducted to evaluate CDA's CVD toolkit. All family physicians in Ontario, Canada, were randomly assigned to receive the toolkit, which includes several printed educational materials aimed at CVD detection, prevention and treatment, either in the spring of 2009 (intervention arm) or in spring 2010 (control arm). Randomization occurred at the practice level. Forty GPs from each arm will be recruited to participate, and the medical records of 20 of their diabetic patients at high CVD risk will be retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures will be assessed for each patient between July 2009 and March 2010. The main outcome will be that the patient is receiving a statin. Secondary outcomes will include 1) receipt of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 2) various intermediate measures (A1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, body mass index and waist circumference), and 3) clinical inertia (the inability to change therapy in response to an abnormal A1c, blood pressure, or cholesterol reading). The analysis will be carried out using multilevel hierarchical logistic regression models to take into account the pooled nature of the data. The assignment of the group will be a variable at the medical level. Additionally, a process evaluation study with six focus groups of family physicians will assess the acceptability of the CDA Toolkit and explore the factors that contribute to any change or lack of change in behavior, from the perspective of family physicians. DISCUSSION: Printed educational materials for physicians have been shown to make small to moderate changes in patient care. CDA's CVD Toolkit is an example of a practice guideline implementation strategy that can be disseminated to a wide audience at relatively low cost, so demonstrating its effectiveness in improving diabetes care could have important implications for guideline developers, policymakers and clinicians.",0,0,
761,Evaluation of abnormal mammography results and palpable breast abnormalities,"Background: Because approximately 1 in 10 women with a breast lump or abnormal mammogram will have breast cancer, a primary care physician must make a number of decisions to exclude or establish a diagnosis of breast cancer. among these women. Purpose: To determine the most accurate and least invasive means of evaluating an abnormal mammography result and a palpable breast abnormality. Data Source: MEDLINE search (January 1966 to March 2003) for articles and reviews describing the accuracy of clinical examination, biopsy procedures, and radiographic examination of patients with abnormal mammography results or palpable breast abnormalities. Study Selection: The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that provided relevant primary data. Studies were included if 1) a mammogram, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or core needle biopsy was performed before a definitive diagnosis""; 2) the study sample included 100 or more women""; and 3) breast cancer status was determined from histopathologic review of excisional biopsy specimens, linkage to a state cancer registry or Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, or 95-year clinical follow-up. % or more of the study sample. Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted the results. Methods were assessed for important potential biases, but methodological scoring was not performed. Data synthesis: odds ratios for first screening mammography were 0.1 for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category negative or benign, 1.2 for probably benign finding, 7 due to the need for additional imaging evaluation, 125 due to suspicious abnormality and 2200 due to high suggestion of malignancy. For fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a palpable lump performed by formally trained clinicians, the odds ratio was infinity for an evaluation of malignant, 2.6 for atypical/suspicious, and 0.02 for benign. When diagnostic mammography was used to evaluate a palpable lump or nonpalpable breast abnormality, the positive odds ratios were 5.6 and 9.4, and the negative odds ratios were 0.15 and 0.19, respectively. suggestive of malignancy are at high risk of breast cancer and should undergo core needle biopsy or needle localization with surgical biopsy. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as needing further imaging evaluation are at moderate risk for breast cancer and should undergo a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound to decide whether to biopsy an unexplained breast lesion. palpable. Women whose screening mammogram results are interpreted as probably benign are at low risk for breast cancer and can have a follow-up mammogram in 6 months. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy or ultrasound is recommended as the first diagnostic test for a palpable breast abnormality to distinguish simple cysts from solid masses. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy also allows characterization of a solid mass. Diagnostic mammography does not help determine whether a palpable breast mass should be biopsied and should not affect the decision to perform a biopsy.",0,0,

The thematic areas that aroused the most interest were: psychological support for affected people, prevention of HIV infection in the health field, clinical advice and diagnosis. 77% had received requests for diagnostic tests and 88% had treated infected people. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low response rate (50%) and the relative variability between the professionals and the health regions of origin, this first evaluation made it possible to identify specific educational needs in the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS infection in primary education. framework of care and also to improve the distribution methods we use.",0,0,
763,Evaluation of an Internet-based decision support system to apply the ATS/CDC guidelines for tuberculosis preventive therapy.,"Preventive therapy for patients infected with tuberculosis (TB) remains an important component of TB control. To guide clinicians in applying preventive therapy, the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) developed guidelines based on PPD reactivity and pre-test probability of infection. The guidelines have become complex and many clinicians find their application difficult. The authors developed a computerized decision support system to help clinicians apply the ATS/CDC guidelines. This tool, published on the World Wide Web using hypertext markup language, provides patient-specific recommendations based on patient-specific information provided by the physician. Four local TB experts derived eight TB infection scenarios and validated the web-based tool, whose efficacy was tested with general internal medicine residents randomly divided into two groups. Group A (n = 12) used the web-based tool and Group B (n = 17) used preexisting understanding of guidelines and/or written resources to determine the need for preventive therapy in case scenarios. Group A correctly used the therapy in 92/96 possible cases (95.8%), group B only in 77/136 (56.6%) (p < 0.001). Group A required an average of three mouse clicks and 1.5 minutes per scenario to get to their options, and they rated the web-based tool as intuitive and effective. These data demonstrate that a computer-based decision support system for applying TB treatment guidelines can be delivered over the Internet and provide an efficient and effective resource for clinicians.",0,1,

Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial. Location: 27 general practices in Avon. Participants: 614 patients aged between 60 and 79 years with arterial hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to a computer-based clinical decision support system plus cardiovascular risk chart""; cardiovascular risk chart alone;"" or usual care. Main outcome measures: Percentage of patients in each group with a 5-year cardiovascular risk = 10%, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular drug prescription. Results: Patients in the computer-based clinical decision support system and charts-only groups were no more likely to have cardiovascular risk reduced below 10% than patients receiving usual care. Patients in the computer-based clinical decision support group were more likely to have cardiovascular risk = 10% than patients with graphs alone, odds ratio 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4 ,8). The chart-only group had significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the usual care group (mean difference: 4.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 8.4 to -0.8). reduction in diastolic blood pressure did not differ between the three groups The chart-only group was twice as likely to be prescribed two classes of cardiovascular medications and more than three times as likely to be prescribed three or more classes of medications compared to the other groups in absolute risk reduction or blood pressure control and requires further development and evaluation before its use in clinical care can be recommended. potentially important increase in systolic blood pressure.",1,1,
765,Evaluation of Internet-based clinical decision support systems.,"Background: Evidence-based clinical guidelines are increasingly being used to educate clinicians and improve quality of care. While individual guidelines are potentially helpful, repeated studies have shown guidelines to be ineffective in changing physician behavior. The Internet has evolved as a potentially useful tool for guideline education, dissemination, and implementation due to its open standards and its ability to provide relevant and concise clinical information where and when it is needed. Objective: Our objective was to develop and test guidelines-based decision support systems (DSS) that could be delivered over the Internet for two disease models: preventive therapy for asthma and tuberculosis (TB). Methods: Using open HTML and CGI standards, we developed an acute asthma severity assessment DSS and a tuberculosis preventive treatment DSS based on the content of national guidelines that are recognized as standards of care. Both DSS are published on the Internet and work through a decision algorithm developed from the main guidelines with clinical information provided by the user at the point of clinical care. We tested the effectiveness of each DSS in influencing clinician decisions through clinical scenario testing. Results: We first validated the asthma algorithm by comparing the decisions of asthma experts with the decisions made by non-pulmonary nurses using the computerized DSS. Using the DSS, nurses scored the same as experts (89% vs. 88%""; p = NS). Using the same scenario test instrument, we then compared internal medicine residents using the DSS with residents using a paper version of the National Asthma Education Program Guidelines 2. Residents using the computerized DSS scored significantly better than residents using the paper guidelines (92% vs. 84%; p < 0.002). ; residents who used the computerized DSS scored significantly better (95.8% vs. 56.6% correct;"" p<0.001). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that guidelines disseminated through traditional educational interventions have a minimal impact on medical behavior. Although computerized DSSs have been effective in changing physician behavior, many of these systems are not widely available. We have developed two clinical DSS based on national guidelines and published them on the Internet. Both systems improved physician compliance with national guidelines when tested in clinical settings. By providing information that is coupled to relevant activity, we hope that these widely available DSSs will serve as effective educational tools to positively impact medical behavior.",0,1,
766,Evaluation of studies investigating the effectiveness of pharmacists' clinical services,"quantitative evaluation of randomized trials of advice, education and other clinical services provided by pharmacists was conducted. Data sources were MEDLINE and bibliographies of published articles. Pharmacists' services were categorized as patient counseling, physician counseling, patient and physician counseling, and patient care. The outcomes extracted were measures of patient behavior, illness, symptoms, and patient knowledge. Thirty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. Pharmacists were specified as clinical pharmacists in 24 trials and as community pharmacists in 2. In six unblinded patient counseling trials, results favored counseled patients over control patients in each trial, and effects were statistically significant in five trials (outcome was medication adherence in these five trials). In seven trials counseling both patients and their doctors, patient outcomes were significantly better in the intervention group in six trials, four of which were single-blinded. Two trials in which patients were randomized to medical advice or control groups gave inconsistent results. In a trial in which doctors were randomized to receive advice from pharmacists, the proportion of prescriptions that met the guidelines was higher in the advice group than in the control group. Four trials of patient care by pharmacists were inconclusive. These trials demonstrated that counseling of patients and their doctors by pharmacists can improve patient outcomes. The evidence that patient counseling alone improved patient outcomes was good, although weaker due to suboptimal trial design.",0,0,

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial by conglomerates of two projects taught under normal classroom conditions. Schools were assigned to one of four groups to receive the Family Tobacco Education (FSE) Project; the Smoking and Me (SAM) Project; Both Projects in Sequence (FSE/SAM);"" or no intervention at all. SCENARIO 39 schools in Wales and England match in size and recruitment profile. SUBJECTS All first-year school students were included and assessed on three occasions (4538 before teaching (1988), 3930 immediately after teaching (1989), 3786 at follow-up year (1990)). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported smoking behavior (supported by a saliva sample) and change in relevant health knowledge, beliefs, and values. RESULTS No consistent significant differences were found in smoking behavior, health knowledge, beliefs, or values between the four groups. For never smokers at baseline, the rate of never smokers in 1990 was 74% (594/804) in the control group, 65% (455/704) in the FSE group, 70% ( 440/625) in the SAM group, and 69% (549/791) in the FSE/SAM group (chi 2adj = 6.1, df = 3, p = 0.1). Knowledge about the effects of smoking increased in all groups from a mean score of 5.4 in 1988 to 6.4 in 1989 and 6.5 in 1990. CONCLUSIONS More comprehensive interventions than health education will be needed to reduce adolescent smoking school only. Other measures should be considered, including new restrictions on access to cigarettes and the promotion of tobacco products. More research will be needed to develop effective school-based health education projects, which need to be formally tested in the field under normal conditions before widespread dissemination.",0,0,
769,Evidence-based behavioral medicine: what is it and how do we get it?,"The goal of evidence-based medicine is ultimately to improve patient outcomes and quality of care. Systematic reviews of the available published evidence are required to identify interventions that lead to improvements in behaviour, health and well-being. Authoritative reviews of the literature depend on the quality of published research and research reports. The Consolidated Statement of Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (www.consort-statement.org) was developed to improve the design and reporting of interventions involving randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in medical journals. We describe the 22 CONSORT guidelines and explain their application to behavioral medicine research and evidence-based practice. Additional guidelines specific to behavioral medicine (eg, adherence to treatment) are also presented. Use of these guidelines by clinicians, educators, policymakers, and researchers designing, reporting, and evaluating or reviewing RCTs will strengthen the research itself and accelerate efforts to apply behavioral medicine research to improve clinical processes and outcomes. behavioral medicine practice.",0,0,
770,Evidence-based care of older people with suspected cognitive impairment in general practice: protocol for the IRIS cluster randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common and complex condition. There are evidence-based guidelines for the management of people with dementia in general practice"";"" however, dementia screening, diagnosis, and outreach have been identified as potential gaps between evidence and practice. Interventions to implement the guidelines in practice have had variable success. The use of theory in the design of implementation interventions has been limited, but it is recommended because of its potential to generate more effective interventions and to help understand the factors that modify the magnitude of intervention effects in trials. This protocol describes the methods of a randomized trial testing a theory-based implementation intervention that, if effective, may provide benefits for people with dementia and their carers. OBJECTIVES: This trial aims to estimate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase adherence of GPs (in Victoria, Australia) to a clinical guideline for the detection, diagnosis and management of dementia in general practice. compared to providing GPs with a hard copy of the guideline. Primary objectives include assessing whether the intervention is effective in increasing the percentage of patients with suspected cognitive impairment who receive care according to two key guideline recommendations: receipt of ai) formal cognitive assessment, and ii) assessment of depression using a validated scale (primary outcomes for the test). METHODS: The design is a parallel cluster randomized trial, with the clusters being general practice. Our goal is to recruit 60 practices per group. Practices will be randomized into intervention and control groups using restricted randomisation. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria, and the screening and diagnostic behaviors of GPs directed at these patients, will be identified and measured through an electronic search of medical records nine months after the start of the intervention. Physicians in the control group will receive a printed copy of the guideline. In addition to receiving the printed guide, professionals from the intervention group will be invited to participate in an interactive face-to-face educational workshop led by opinion leaders. The theory-based intervention aims to address the identified barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the recommendations. The investigators responsible for identifying the cohort of patients with suspected cognitive impairment and their screening and diagnostic results will not know the group assignment.

The third version is explicitly based on the available evidence and is presented, like the previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, as recommendations to help professionals make clinical decisions: it can also serve as a source of information for patients and carers, and help in the audit. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the corresponding evidence. A consensus meeting, involving experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and considered the strength of the evidence and the clinical implications. The guidelines were written after extensive feedback from these participants. The best evidence from randomized controlled trials and, where available, observational studies using quasi-experimental designs were used to assess treatment options. The strength of the recommendations has been described using the GRADE approach. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for the use of medications in short-term treatment of episodes, relapse prevention, and treatment discontinuation.

775,Evidence-based medicine and women: do EBM principles and practice improve women's health?,"Physicians and policymakers around the world are embracing evidence-based medicine (EBM). The promise of EBM is to use summaries of research evidence to determine which health care interventions are effective and which are not, so that patients can benefit from effective interventions and be protected from useless or harmful ones. EBM provides an ostensibly rational, objective means of deciding whether or not an intervention should be provided on the basis of its efficacy, which in theory leads to fair and effective health care for all. In this article, I take a closer look at these claims from the perspective of women's health care, using relevant examples. I argue that current evidence-based medicine processes contain a number of biases against women. These biases occur in the production of research that informs evidence-based medicine, in the methods used to analyze and synthesize evidence, and in the application of EBM through the use of guidelines. Finally, the biomedical model of health that underpins most of the medical research used by EBM ignores the social and political context that contributes so much to women's poor health.",0,0,
776,Evidence based medicine. Interpretation of studies and establishment of policies,"The rise of EBM has been accompanied by a heightened awareness of its shortcomings. It is becoming increasingly apparent from the cost, length and difficulty of conducting RCTs that studies cannot be initiated to address all questions in medicine. Good evidence is often lacking in medicine. Epistemologists question the very notions of evidence and the adequacy of current study designs and measurement tools to investigate the salient issues of concern to patients and other quality-conscious people. Lack of evidence of efficacy does not prove ineffectiveness; however, in reaction to EBM, insurance companies and the government often make this inference to justify decisions to withhold coverage or support research. The unbridled enthusiasm for evidence-based practice guidance from the early 1990s has been tempered by a more mature understanding of its limitations. Not many practice guidelines are well developed, and implementation of faulty guidelines can cause harm. The seven-step process outlined above is slow, laborious, and expensive (sometimes running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars). Furthermore, there is little evidence that the rigor of the methods or the guidelines themselves have a significant effect on practice behavior or patient outcomes. To the most cynical observer, the only consistent beneficiaries of the guidelines are the payers, who use the guidelines with considerable success in reducing costs, length of stay, and utilization rates. Even staunch guideline advocates acknowledge the evidence that dissemination of reviews and recommendations alone fails to motivate clinicians to increase delivery of effective interventions and abandon ineffective ones. This lack of response has stimulated a closer look at the barriers to behavior change and the design of thoughtful implementation strategies that start with simple guidelines, but go further. Tools such as reminder systems, standing orders, academic details, peer review and auditing, feedback, and health system changes recognize that knowing what to do is just one piece of an increasingly complex puzzle. The competitive market for managed care has added new economic influences on physician behavior, but it is also fueling private sector interest in good research. Patients, doctors, and policymakers will continue to seek better data on what works in medicine and what doesn't.",0,0,
777,Analytical Quality Review of Behavioral Health Randomized Clinical Trials,"The adoption of an evidence-based practice (EBP) policy has implications for both clinicians and researchers. In fields that have already adopted EBP, evidence-based practice guidelines are derived from systematic reviews of research evidence. Ultimately, such guidelines serve as tools used by professionals. Systematic reviews of treatment efficacy and effectiveness reserve their strongest support for treatments that are backed by high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs). It is unknown how well RCTs reported in behavioral science journals compare to established quality standards in fields that pioneered the evidence-based movement. We compared the analytical quality characteristics of all behavioral health RCTs (n = 73) published in three leading behavioral journals and two leading medical journals between January 2000 and July 2003. One behavioral health trial was launched as one that employs a behavioral treatment modality to prevent or treat an acute or chronic disease or physical condition. The findings revealed areas of weakness in the analytical aspects of the behavioral health RCTs reported in both sets of journals. Weaknesses were more pronounced in behavioral journals.

779,Exceptional Births: Home Births as Ethical Anomalies in American Obstetrics,"Interest in home birth appears to be growing among American women, and most obstetricians can expect to find patients considering home birth. In 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued an opinion statement intended to guide obstetricians in responding to such patients. In this article, I examine the ACOG statement in light of the historical and contemporary clinical realities surrounding home birth in the United States, an examination guided in part by my own experiences as an obstetrician with favorable and unfavorable home births. medical means. Comparison with other guidelines indicates that ACOG treats home birth as an ethical exception: comparable evidence leads to strikingly different recommendations in the case of home birth and the case of trial of labor after prior cesarean section"";"" and ACOG treats other controversial topics involving similar ethical issues quite differently. By presenting the provision of information as not only the primary but the sole ethical responsibility of the obstetrician, the ACOG statement obviates the responsibilities of obstetricians to provide appropriate clinical care and create the safest possible clinical environment for those mothers who choose intrauterine delivery. home and for their newborns. . What, at first glance, appears to be a statement of respect for women's autonomy implicitly authorizes behavior that unethically restricts truly autonomous choices. I argue that obstetricians do not need to attend home births. However, our ethical duties compel us to (1) refer clients to trained physicians who will deliver at home, (2) continue respectful prenatal care for those women who choose home birth, (3) provide appropriate consultation to home midwives, and (4) to ensure that transfers of care are seamless and non-punitive.",0,0,
780,"Reference to exercise: the public health panacea for the promotion of physical activity? A critical perspective of exercise reference schemes"";"" its development and evaluation","This review critically explores the development, impact and evaluation of exercise referral schemes (ERS) in the UK. There has been a rapid expansion in the use of such ERS in leisure and primary care settings, but the evidence supporting their implementation has been sparse and predominantly limited to the research design of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Consequently, understanding of exercise referral as a 'real world' intervention has been limited. Given the increasing importance placed on evidence-based practice and clinical effectiveness, it is no longer enough for exercise referral service providers to ignore the need to evaluate schemes. The assessment guidelines provided by the National Quality Assurance Framework for Exercise Reference are limited, so practitioners are often unsure of the best measures to assess effectiveness. Predominantly, exercise professionals focus on physiological data collection, but tend to ignore relevant psychological and environmental parameters. Furthermore, few studies from the UK have followed participants long-term, to see if physical activity behavior is maintained over time. Here, we describe the evidence from two ongoing large-scale (n = 1600/year) evaluation studies of baseline exercise regimens, based on urban locations in the North West of England. A participatory action research framework was used for the evaluation, and multi-method research approaches were incorporated for the evaluation of both HRA participants and health professionals involved in implementing the intervention. This framework is an appropriate methodology for the evaluation and development of complex interventions, and here incorporates case studies, focus groups, interviews, and survey questionnaires. We included a 12-month follow-up study of a cohort of exercise reference participants (n = 342), which measured physical activity levels at leisure time (Godin's leisure time score), at baseline (entry to exercise baseline) and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Adherence to the ERS was approximately 35% to 45%, and older participants were more likely to complete it. The physiological changes during the ERS, although statistically significant, were not of a magnitude that conveyed any real health benefit to an individual's health status. Although small in scale, the physiological changes were all in a positive direction (eg, reduction in blood pressure) and, if sustained over time, could lead to population-level health benefits. Participants referred by specialist and cardiac nurses had higher levels of adherence than participants referred by general practitioners. Scheme B showed that participants who adhered (n = 103) until the end of the ERS (12 weeks) were able to maintain a small increase in physical activity at the end of 12 months (increase of 21 min moderate activity/week in comparison with base). In conclusion, this research shows that the exercise bypass process benefits certain segments of the population, but not necessarily all.",0,0,
781,"Expanded HIV Screening in the United States: Effect on Clinical Outcomes, HIV Transmission, and Costs","Background: An extensive literature supports the expansion of HIV screening in the United States. However, the question of whom to test and how often remains controversial. Objective: To inform the design of HIV screening programs by identifying combinations of screening frequency and HIV prevalence and incidence in which screening is cost-effective. Design: Cost-benefit analysis linking HIV screening simulation models to published reports of the risk of HIV transmission, with and without antiretroviral therapy. Data sources: Published randomized trials, observational cohorts, national surveys of service utilization and costs, the Red Book, and results from previous models. Target Population: US communities with low to moderate HIV prevalence (0.05% to 1.0%) and annual incidence (0.0084% to 0.12%). Time horizon: lifetime. Perspective: Social. Interventions: Voluntary once-increasing HIV screening of all adults using a same-day rapid test. Outcome measures: HIV infections detected, secondary transmissions averted, quality-adjusted survival, lifetime medical costs, and societal returns, reported in discounted 2004 dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Base-case analysis results: Under moderately favorable assumptions regarding the effect of care for HIV patients on secondary transmission, screening for HIV in a population with an HIV prevalence of 1.0% and an annual incidence of 0.12% had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,800/QALY (screening once), $32,300/QALY (screening every 5 years), and $55,500/QALY (screening every 3 years). In settings with an HIV prevalence of 0.10% and an annual incidence of 0.014%, single screening produced cost-effectiveness ratios of $60,700/QALY. Sensitivity analysis results: The cost-effectiveness of screening policies varied within a narrow range, as assumptions about the effect of screening on secondary transmission ranged from favorable to unfavourable. Assuming moderately favorable effects of antiretroviral therapy on transmission, cost-effectiveness ratios remained below $50,000/QALY in settings with HIV prevalence as low as 0.20% for one-time HIV screening and with prevalences as low as 0.45% and annual. incidences as low as 0.0075% for screening every 5 years. Limitations: This review does not address the difficulty of determining the prevalence and incidence of undetected HIV infection in a given patient population.

Design Comparison of the degree of importance of the clinical variables considered in the adequacy ratings of the panel of experts against a previously published decision analytic model. Identification of 36 clinical scenarios from the panel of experts that could be simulated by the decision analytic model. Main outcome measures Suitability score and suitability rating (expert panel) versus gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness (decision analytic model). Results The most important clinical variables were similar in the 2 approaches, with the result of the exercise tolerance test exerting the greatest influence on the strength of the recommendation for angiography. Among expert panel clinical scenarios deemed appropriate for coronary angiography that could be simulated in the decision analysis model, the median (interquartile range) health gain and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were 0.59 ( 0.41-0.76) QALYs and $27,000 ($23,000-$35,000) per QALY earned, respectively. Among clinical scenarios deemed inappropriate by the expert panels, the corresponding medians (interquartile ranges) were 0.24 (0.19-0.34) QALYs and $54,000 ($36,000-$58,000) per QALY gained. Spearman's rank correlation between appropriateness score and QALY gain was 0.58 (p < 0.001) and between appropriateness score and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 0.66 (p < 0.001) . Conclusions For the 36 expert panel scenarios that could be simulated using the decision analytic model, there was moderate to good agreement between the adequacy score and both the health gain and incremental cost-effectiveness of coronary angiography. compared with no angiography in convalescent patients. phase of acute myocardial infarction, but several scenarios considered inappropriate by the expert panel approach had comparable cost-effectiveness ratios with many generally recommended medical interventions.

785,Explanation of the effects of two different strategies to promote hand hygiene in hospital nurses: a process evaluation together with a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There is only limited understanding of why hand hygiene improvement strategies succeed or fail. Therefore, it is important to look inside the 'black box' of such strategies, to determine which components of a strategy are working well or not. This study examined which components of two hand hygiene improvement strategies were associated with higher hand hygiene compliance by nurses. METHODS: A process evaluation of a cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out in which part of the nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands received a state-of-the-art strategy, including education, reminders, feedback and optimization of materials and facilities. ;"" another party received a team- and leader-led strategy that included all elements of the leading edge strategy, supplemented with activities targeting empowerment and social leadership. This process evaluation used four sets of measures: effects on hygiene compliance of nurses, adherence to improvement strategies, contextual factors, and nurses' experiences with the components of the strategy.Analysis of variance and multiple regression analyzes were used to explore changes in hand hygiene compliance of nurses. nurses and thus better understand the effects of the trial. RESULTS: Both strategies were performed with good protocol adherence. Two contextual factors were associated with changes in hand hygiene compliance: a long-term hospital effect ( p < 0.05) and high baseline hand hygiene scores were associated with smaller effects. dreams (p < 0.01). In the short term, changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance were positively correlated with experienced feedback on their hand hygiene performance (p < 0.05). In the long term, several items from the components 'social influence' (i.e., talking to each other about undesirable hand hygiene behavior p < 0.01) and 'leadership' (i.e., the room manager holds members responsible team for hand hygiene performance p < 0.01) was positively correlated with changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the use of a process evaluation to uncover the mechanisms underlying change in hand hygiene improvement strategies. The results of our study demonstrate the added value of specific aspects of social influence and leadership in hand hygiene improvement strategies, thus offering an interpretation of the effects of the trial.

786,Explanation of the variation in GP referral rates for X-rays for back pain,"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain (LBP), there remains a wide variation in referral rates from general practitioners (GPs) for lumbar spine radiography (LSX). This study aims to explain the variation in LSX referral rates of GPs based on their reports on the management of patients with low back pain. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews with 29 GPs with high and low referral rates for LSX in the North East of England. The thematic analysis used constant comparative techniques. RESULTS: Common and divergent themes were identified between high and low users of LSX. Topics that were similar in both groups included knowledge of current guidelines for LSX use for LBP patients and patient pressure and institutional factors to order an LSX. Differentiating themes for the high user group included: the belief that LSX provides reassurance to patients that they can overcome the risks, pessimism about management options for LBP, and the belief that withholding LSX would negatively affect doctor-patient relationships . Two specific differentiating issues are considered in more depth: GPs' awareness of the use of lumbar spine radiology relative to others, and the perceived risks associated with LSX radiation. CONCLUSION: Several key factors differentiate accounts of GPs having high and low rates of referral for LSX, despite being aware of guideline recommendations. Intervention studies that aim to increase adherence to guideline recommendations on LSX use by changing the ordering behavior of physicians in primary care should focus on these factors.",0,0,
787,Explanation of variations in prescription costs in England,"OBJECTIVE To derive a predictive model for national prescribing behavior in terms of baseline morbidity and demographic factors. DESIGN Twenty-four demographic, morbidity, and practice factors were entered into a multiple regression analysis to determine net ingredient cost per patient. SCENARIO All 90 family health services authorities in England for 1989. RESULTS For net cost of ingredients per patient, only two demographic factors (number of pensioners and registered population mobility measured by list inflation) and two factors related to morbidity (standardized mortality ratios and numbers of prepaid certificates issued) contributed significantly to a multiple regression model. This model explained 81% of the variation in the net cost of ingredients per registered patient among the authorities of the family health services. The model also allowed a weighting factor of 4.6 (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 6.7) to be derived for the net cost of ingredients for elderly patients (compared to the unit factor of 3) existing prescription. CONCLUSIONS The model shows that variations in prescription costs essentially reflect demand. It also suggests that the current prescription unit value of 3 for patients 65 years and older underestimates additional prescription costs for elderly patients.",0,0,
788,Exploratory analysis of patients' motivations to quit smoking and to participate in smoking cessation classes,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A major investigation has evaluated the impacts of smoking, the impacts of secondhand smoke exposure, the effectiveness of a variety of social and individual smoking cessation interventions, and the frequency with which clinicians talk about quitting. smoking with his patients. Little research has addressed barriers to physician-initiated discussion and intervention related to smoking cessation, especially in relation to resident physicians treating low-income patients. Existing research indicates that clinicians have low expectations regarding patients' wishes to quit and often wait to discuss smoking cessation with patients until the patient brings up the subject. The purpose of this pilot was to identify trends in smoking, desire to quit, and desire to participate in smoking cessation classes at the family medicine clinic. METHODS: Patients completed a survey to obtain demographic information, smoking behavior, presence of chronic diseases, desire to quit, and reasons for wanting to quit. RESULTS: Higher rates of smoking and lower rates of desired quitting were identified. However, among patients contemplating quitting, a relatively high number wanted smoking cessation classes. A higher number of unsuccessful quit attempts predicted higher odds of both wanting to quit and wanting quit classes. Other predictors of desire to quit and class participation are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current research, clinicians are encouraged to follow practice guidelines, asking all patients about smoking behavior and assisting them in their efforts to quit smoking, especially those who have been unsuccessful in quitting. last.",0,0,
789,Exploring nurses' and patients' perspectives on limit setting in a forensic mental health setting,"Limit setting is an intervention frequently used by mental health nurses. However, limit setting is poorly conceptualized, its purpose is unclear, and few evidence-based guidelines exist to help nurses set limits safely and effectively. What is known is that how nurses set limits influences patients' perceptions of interactions and their emotional and behavioral responses. In this qualitative study, 12 nurses and 12 patients participated in personal semi-structured interviews that aimed to explore limit setting and propose principles to guide practice. The findings suggested that: (i) limit setting is important for safety in mental health hospitals""; (ii) patients need to be empathically involved when limits are set (when nurses are empathetically involved , the therapeutic relationship is more likely to be preserved and the risk of aggressive responses is reduced);"" and (iii) an authoritarian (fair, respectful, consistent, and knowledgeable) limit-setting style, rather than authoritarian (controlling and indifferent), improves positive outcomes regarding adherence, reduced likelihood of aggression, and preservation of the therapeutic relationship. In conclusion, a limit-setting style characterized by an empathic response and an authoritative style, rather than an authoritarian interpersonal style, is recommended. Elucidating the components of this style is critical to effective training and best practice for mental health nurses, and to reducing aggressive limit-setting responses.",0,0,
790,Exploring the feasibility of joint analysis as a tool to prioritize innovations for implementation,"Background In an era of few and competing priorities for implementation, choosing what to implement is a key decision point for many behavior change projects. The values and attitudes of the professionals and managers involved inevitably impact the priority given to decision options. Reliable capture of such values is challenging. Methods This article presents an approach to capture and incorporate professional values in the prioritization of healthcare innovations being considered for adoption. Conjoint analysis (CA) was used in a single UK Primary Care Trust to measure the priorities of healthcare professionals working with women with postpartum depression. Rating-based CA data was collected using a questionnaire and then mapped onto 12 interventions that were considered as a means of improving the management of postpartum depression. Results Â¡Â®Impact on patient careÂ¡Â¯ and Â¡Â®Quality of supporting evidenceÂ¡Â¯ associated with potential innovations were the most influential in setting priorities. Practitioners were less influenced by whether an innovation was an existing national or local priority, or whether current practice at the Trust met minimum standards. Ranking the 12 innovations according to potential adopters' preferences revealed that ""guided self-help"" was the highest priority for implementation and ""postpartum depression screening questions"" the least important. When other factors (such as the presence of routine data or planned implementation activity elsewhere in the Trust) were considered, the project team chose to combine the eight related treatments and implement them as a single innovation called 'psychological therapies'. A. Conclusions Using conjoint analysis to prioritize possible innovation implementation options is a feasible means of capturing the usefulness of stakeholders and thereby increasing the chances that an innovation will be adopted. There are some practical barriers to overcome, such as increasing response rates to pooled surveys before considering routine, untested use of this technique.",0,1,
791,Exploring the gap between knowledge and behavior: a qualitative study of clinical action after an educational intervention,"PURPOSE: Many medical education interventions improve physician knowledge but fail to change behavior. The authors exposed this knowledge and behavior gap through standardized clinical interactions, which allowed for an in-depth exploration of contributing factors. METHOD: A typical evidence-based educational intervention in a clinical domain (early signs of autism) was administered to family medicine residents at the University of Toronto in 2001-02, and change in knowledge was assessed through a test of multiple choice. Six to eight weeks later, the participants' relevant knowledge was documented and their clinical behavior observed during four interactions with standardized patients. Factors producing a discrepancy between knowledge and behavior were then explored through semi-structured interviews, which were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory methods. RESULTS: Half of the participants demonstrated varying degrees of knowledge and behavior gap. Eight major rationalizations (relationships, patient agenda, knowledge deficit, clinical style, means to an end, ideals, autism stigma, and systems barriers) were used to justify clinical behavior choices, and the same rationalizations were used to justify opposite behavioral choices. . Two conditions that promote clinical action based on knowledge (level of certainty and sense of urgency) were identified. CONCLUSION: The knowledge-behavior gap was exposed and reported factors influencing clinicians' decisions about whether to implement new knowledge were elicited. That identical rationalizations were used to justify opposing behaviors implies that these factors may not be determinants of behavior. The sense of urgency and the level of certainty favor clinical action based on knowledge"";"" focusing on these can increase the impact of education in practice.",0,0,
792,Exploring the Roots of Unwanted Security Threats Associated with the Introduction of Hospital Electronic Prescribing Systems and Candidate Prevention and/or Mitigation Strategies: A Qualitative Study,"Objective Hospital's electronic prescription systems (ePrescribing) offer a wide range of benefits for patient safety. However, like other hospital health information technology interventions, they can also introduce new areas of risk. Despite recent advances in identifying these risks, the development and use of electronic prescription systems continue to have many unintended consequences, which can undermine improvement and threaten patient safety. These negative consequences need to be analyzed in the design, implementation and use of these systems. Therefore, our goal was to understand the roots of these reported threats and identify potential avoidance/mitigation strategies. Methods We analyzed a longitudinal qualitative study of the implementation and adoption of electronic prescription systems in six English hospitals, each of which was conceptualized as a case study. The data included semi-structured interviews, observations of system implementation and use meetings, and a collection of relevant documents. We first analyze the data within and then across the case studies. Results Our data set included 214 interviews, 24 observations, and 18 documents. We developed a taxonomy of factors underlying unwanted security threats in: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex drug delivery regimens, lack of effective integration between different systems, and lack of support tools effective automated decision-making""; (2) inappropriate use of systems, in particular, over-reliance on the system and introduction of workarounds;"" and (3) suboptimal implementation strategies resulting from partial implementations/dual systems and lack of adequate training. We have identified a number of organizational and systems strategies that could avoid or reduce these risks. Conclusions Imperfections in the design, implementation, and use of electronic prescription systems can lead to unintended consequences, including security threats. Hospitals and providers must implement short-term and long-term strategies in terms of technology and organization to minimize unwanted security risks.",0,0,
793,"External validity of randomized controlled trials: ""to whom do the results of this trial apply?""","When making treatment decisions, clinicians and patients should consider relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Relevance depends on external validity (or generalisability), that is, whether the results can be reasonably applied to a definable group of patients in a particular clinical setting in routine practice. There is concern among clinicians that external validity is often poor, particularly for some pharmaceutical industry trials, a perception that has led to the underuse of treatments that are effective. However, researchers, funding agencies, ethics committees, the pharmaceutical industry, medical journals, and government regulators neglect external validity, leaving decisions to physicians. However, reporting of determinants of external validity in trial publications and systematic reviews is often inadequate. This review discusses those determinants, presents a checklist for clinicians, and makes recommendations for further consideration of external validity in the design and reporting of RCTs.",0,0,

Recent DSM literature and research is reviewed in relation to (a) patients' DSM perceptions and experiences of office visits and (b) most effective office-based DSM programs. This quality primary care framework enables clinical nurses to more consistently assess and integrate individual patient factors using typically limited clinical resources at office visits to optimize DSM patient outcomes.,0,0,
795,Factor surveys: using vignettes to study professional judgment.,"Decision making is becoming an increasingly central feature of social work practice, yet there is limited research on the topic. Experimental methods for investigating decision making tend to be limited by practical and ethical difficulties, while questions of validity and generalizability surround ethnographic and other descriptive methods. It is argued here that the factorial survey addresses these methodological difficulties as a research design to study how professionals make decisions in real life. In this research design, actual vignettes (case scenarios or paper cases) are presented to social workers or other staff to make a judgment about one type of family scenario. Random factors within vignettes, combined with randomization of vignette selection for each decision maker, give the factorial survey a unique ability to investigate the effect of multiple factors on complex decisions, unlike the more common factorial experiment. The method is explained and the perspectives and issues for the development of this research design to study professional judgment within social work are discussed. The factorial survey has potential as a method for the rigorous study of the impact of client, family, and context factors on the decisions of social work and social care personnel.

796,Factors affecting the feasibility and acceptability of a practice-based educational intervention to support evidence-based prescribing: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate and costly GP prescribing is a major problem facing primary care trusts. Educational outreach in practices, along with other measures such as audit and feedback, have the potential to enable GP prescribing to be more evidence-based. High GP prescription costs are associated with GPs seeing pharmaceutical company representatives ""tend to end consultations with prescriptions""; and 'testing' new drugs 'ad hoc' and using this as evidence of drug effect. An educational intervention called 'reflective practice' was developed to meet these and other educational needs. The intervention design was based on studies that have identified the prerequisites for successful behavior change in general practice. OBJECTIVES: The study investigated the following: (i) Is it feasible for GPs to attend the sessions included in the educational intervention? (ii) Is the intervention acceptable to the participants and session facilitators? (iii) What are the barriers to group educational processes and how can they be overcome? METHODS: Four practices in the south west of England were recruited, all experiencing problems with prescription eligibility and cost. Reflective practice sessions (including a videotaped scenario) were conducted in each of these practices and qualitative methods were used to explore the complex attitudes and behavior of the participants. A researcher observed and recorded audio sessions in each practice. At the end of the program, a sample of doctors and all the facilitators were interviewed about their experiences. Recorded data was transcribed and analyzed using standard qualitative methods. RESULTS: Physicians from the largest associations had the greatest difficulty attending sessions. Elsewhere, physicians were also reluctant to get involved due to previous experience of top-down management initiatives on prescribing quality. The facilitators came from a wide range of professional backgrounds. While knowledge of prescription medication management issues was important, the facilitator's professional experience was less important than group facilitation skills in creating a group process that participating physicians found satisfactory. The videotaped scenario was found to be helpful in setting the stage for the discussion. Preserving the anonymity of the GPs' responses in the early stages of the sessions was important to ensure honesty in the discussion. It was sometimes difficult to reach a consensus on the management of common conditions, partly because the use of the term ""best buy"" implies economic pressures, rather than benefits for patients, and partly because of the value that GPs give the concept of clinical autonomy. 'Reflective practice' seemed to have the potential to make clinicians aware of the relationship between their clinical management decisions and the evidence provided by the British National Formulary and Clinical Evidence. CONCLUSION: The study indicates the importance of preparing the practice adequately, including providing sheltered time for all general practitioners to attend the educational intervention. The settings and the structure of the sessions should make the links between daily practice and published evidence of effectiveness more explicit. The emphasis on profitability can be counterproductive and the broader benefits need to be emphasized. We have also identified the skills profile of the facilitator role. Our study indicates the need for a clearer understanding of GPs' perceived clinical autonomy and how this conflicts with the goal of agreement on practice guidelines for treatment. The intervention is now ripe for further development, perhaps integrating it with other interventions to change professional behaviour. The improved intervention should then be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,
797,Factors associated with nursing interventions to reduce incontinence in hospitalized elderly,"INTRODUCTION: The problem of incontinence in hospitalized elderly patients is poorly documented and there is little research to determine why nurses choose to help or not help with this problem. Are hospital critical care nurses' attitudes and beliefs about incontinence associated with the perceived opportunity to help the patient with the problem? What do hospital nurses know about the causes and interventions related to incontinence? METHODS: Two vignettes were created, one describing a patient with stress incontinence and one describing a patient with urge incontinence. Questions that measure variables of a support model were developed and nurses were asked to mark on a Likert-type scale when answering each question. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty respondents returned the completed questionnaires along with three expert nurses. Many hospital nurses believed that incontinence was temporary and part of old age. As a group, they had a more positive attitude towards the urge incontinence intervention and believed that the physician and their nurse manager expected them to help the urge incontinence patient. Respondents tended to believe that the patient was less likely to expect help. Respondents were equally divided about the opportunity to provide assistance for stress or urge incontinence. Less than half of the nurses correctly listed the causes and interventions for stress or urge incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Other perceived more pressing clinical problems and lack of knowledge about appropriate supportive measures affect nurses' perceptions of the opportunity to intervene when elderly hospitalized patients are incontinent. Assessment and intervention are essential for quality nursing care. Undergraduate nursing education and continuing staff education on continence are crucial for successful assessments and interventions. Patients, as consumers of health care, need to be more informed about incontinence and choose to have the problem addressed during hospitalization. The Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research are an important recommended reference.",0,0,

Objectives To estimate the prevalence of mental illness and factors associated with poor mental health in underserved Guatemalan refugee communities located in Chiapas, Mexico, since 1981 and to assess the need for mental health services. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey of 183 households in 5 Mayan refugee camps in Chiapas representing approximately 1,546 residents (adults and children) conducted from November to December 2000. Main outcome measures Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom criteria ), anxiety , and depression as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (Hopkins-25). Results One adult (age = 16 years) per household (n = 170 respondents) who agreed to participate was included in the analysis, representing approximately 93% of households. All respondents reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event with a mean of 8.3 traumatic events per person. Of those surveyed, 20 (11.8%) had full criteria for PTSD symptoms.

799,Failure of computerized treatment suggestions to improve health outcomes for outpatients with uncomplicated hypertension: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"The purpose of the study. To assess the effects of evidence-based treatment suggestions for hypertension made to physicians and pharmacists using a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Design. Randomized controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of physician and pharmacist interventions, resulting in four groups of patients: physician intervention only, pharmacist intervention only, physician and pharmacist intervention, and intervention with no physician or pharmacist (control). ). Around. Academic practice of primary care internal medicine. Subjects. Seven hundred and twelve patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Measurements and Main Results. The suggestions were shown to physicians at the computer workstations used to write outpatient prescriptions and to pharmacists when filling prescriptions. The primary endpoint was generic health-related quality of life. Secondary endpoints were symptom profile and side effects of antihypertensive medications, number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, patient satisfaction with physicians and pharmacists, compliance with drug therapy and charges for medical care. In the control group, implementation of changes in care according to treatment suggestions was observed in 26% of patients. In the intervention groups, adherence to suggestions was poor, with treatment suggestions implemented in 25% of patients for whom suggestions were shown only to pharmacists, 29% of those for whom suggestions were shown only to physicians and 35% of the group for whom both physicians and pharmacists received suggestions (p=0.13). Between-group differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant for generic health-related quality of life, symptom and side effect profiles, number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, charges or compliance with drug therapy.

The computerized intervention using a sophisticated electronic physician order entry system failed to improve adherence to treatment suggestions or outcomes for patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",0,1,
800,Fall prevention in acute care hospitals: a randomized trial.,"Context Falls cause injury and death to people of all ages, but the risk of falling increases markedly with age. Hospitalization further increases risk, but there is no evidence to support short-stay hospital fall prevention strategies to reduce patient falls. Objective To investigate whether a falls prevention toolkit (FPTK) using health information technology (HIT) decreases patient falls in hospitals. Design, Setting, and Patients Randomized cluster study conducted from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2009, comparing rates of falls for patients in 4 urban US hospitals in units receiving usual care (4 units and 5104 patients) or the intervention (4 units and 5160 patients). Intervention The FPTK integrated existing communication and workflow patterns into the HIT application. Based on a valid fall risk assessment scale completed by a nurse, FPTK software tailored fall prevention interventions to address patients' specific determinants of fall risk. FPTK produced bedside banners comprised of short text with an accompanying icon, patient education brochures, and care plans, all communicating specific patient alerts to key stakeholders. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was patient falls per 1000 patient-days adjusted for site and patient care unit. A secondary outcome was fall-related injuries. Results During the 6-month intervention period, the number of patients with falls differed between control (n = 87) and intervention (n = 67) units (p = 0.02).

801,Requests from relatives to extend physiological support after the declaration of brain death: analysis of a series of cases and proposal of clinical management guidelines,"We describe and analyze 13 cases attended by our ethics consultation service (ECS) in which families requested the continuation of physiological support for their loved ones after death had been declared by neurological criteria (DNC). These ethics consultations took place between 2005 and 2013. The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 85 years. Continuous mechanical ventilation was the central intervention sought by all families. The ECS's advice and recommendations generally promoted ""reasonable accommodation"" of claims, balancing compassion for bereaved families with other ethical and moral concerns, such as stewardship of resources, professional integrity, and moral distress. In the cases we characterize as finite goal adaptation, a ""reasonable fit"" strategy proved effective in balancing the interests and goals of stakeholders, allowing for steady progress toward resolution. When a family adamantly opposed a DNC declaration and requested an indefinite accommodation, the ""reasonable accommodation"" approach offered clinicians little practical direction, and resolution required definitive action by the family or clinical team. Based on our analysis and reflections on these 13 cases, we propose practical and ethically justified guidelines to help health professionals, administrators, and CHIs facing similar cases.",0,0,
802,Family-based interventions to increase physical activity in children: a meta-analysis and realistic synthesis protocol.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the established relationship between physical activity and health, data suggest that many children are insufficiently active and that levels decline in adolescence. Involving the family in interventions can increase and maintain children's physical activity levels at the critical time before high school. Synthesis of existing evidence will inform future studies, but the heterogeneity in the target populations recruited, the behavior change techniques and intervention strategies employed, and the measurement performed may require a multifaceted review approach. Therefore, the main objective of this paper will be to synthesize the evidence from intervention studies that explicitly engage the family unit to increase children's physical activity using an innovative dual meta-analysis and realistic approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Peer-reviewed studies will be independently assessed by two authors for inclusion on the basis of (1) including 'healthy' participants aged 5 to 12 years"";"" (2) have a substantive intervention goal of increasing physical activity, involving the family, and (3) reporting physical activity. Duplicate data extraction and quality assessment will be performed using a specially designed form and the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool, respectively. STATA software will be used to calculate effect sizes for meta-analyses, and subgroup analyzes will be performed to identify moderating characteristics. Realistic syntheses will be performed in accordance with RAMESES publication and quality guidelines, including the development of a program theory and evidence mapping. DISSEMINATION: This review will be the first to use a traditional review framework to conduct a dual meta-analysis and realist synthesis, examining interventions involving the family to increase physical activity in children. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences, formal presentations to policymakers and practitioners, and informal meetings. The evidence generated from this synthesis will also be used to inform the development of evidence-based and theory-based interventions aimed at engaging the family to increase physical activity levels in children.

804,Rapid Tracking of Theory-Based KT Intervention Design Through a Consensus Process,"BACKGROUND: Despite available evidence for optimal management of spinal pain, poor adherence to guidelines and wide variations in health care services persist. One of the goals of the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative is to develop and evaluate targeted interventions based on theory and evidence to improve the management of non-specific neck pain by chiropractors. In order to systematically develop a knowledge translation (KT) intervention supported by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we explored the perceived factors influencing the use of multimodal care to manage non-specific neck pain, and mapped behavior change techniques to key theorists. domains METHODS: Individual telephone interviews exploring neck pain management beliefs were conducted with a purposive sample of 13 chiropractors. The interview guide was based on the TDF. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed word for word, and analyzed by two independent assessors using thematic content analysis. A 15-member expert panel met formally to design a KT intervention. RESULTS: Nine TDF domains were identified as probably relevant. Key beliefs (and relevant TDF domains) included the following: influence of formal training, colleagues, and patients on clinicians (Social Influences); availability of educational material (Context and environmental resources); and better clinical results that reinforce the use of multimodal methods.

Facilitating factors that were considered important included better communication (Skills); audits of the results related to the treatment of patients (regulation of behavior); awareness and agreement with guidelines (Knowledge);"" and adaptation of multimodal care (Memory, Attention and Decision Processes). Physicians expressed conflicting beliefs about perceived threats to professional autonomy (Role and social/professional identity) and the speed of recovery when applying or ignoring practical recommendations (Beliefs about Consequences) The expert panel mapped behavior change techniques to key theoretical domains and identified strategies and KT delivery modes relevant to increasing the use of multimodal care among chiropractors.CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted KT educational intervention targeting neck pain management by chiropractors was developed.The KT intervention consisted of a series of online education webinars, clinical vignettes, and a video supported by the brief action planning model.The intervention was designed to reflect domains te key theoretical, behavior change techniques, and intervention components. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention remains to be verified.",0,0,
805,Feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based implementation strategies for mental health therapists implementing cognitive behavioral therapy: a pilot study to inform a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Informed by our previous work indicating that therapists do not feel recognized or rewarded for implementing evidence-based practices, we tested the feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based implementation strategies that seek to improve therapist adherence to cognitive therapy. -behavioral for young people, an evidence-based practice. Methods This study took place over 6 weeks in two community mental health agencies with therapists (n = 11) and leaders (n = 4). Therapists were randomly assigned to receive a financial or social incentive if they met a predetermined criterion for adherence to cognitive behavioral therapy. In the first intervention period (block 1""; 2 weeks), therapists received the reward to which they were initially randomized if they met the criteria. In the second intervention period (block 2;"" 2 weeks), therapists received both rewards if they met the criteria. Therapists recorded 41 sessions on 15 unique clients during the project period. Primary outcomes included feasibility and acceptability. Viability was quantitatively evaluated. Fifteen semi-structured interviews with therapists and leaders were conducted to assess acceptability. The difference in therapist adherence by condition was examined as an exploratory outcome. Adherence ratings were determined using an established and validated cognitive behavioral therapy observational coding system. Results Both implementation strategies were feasible and acceptable; however, the study design will need to be modified for the larger trial based on participant feedback. Regarding our exploratory analysis, we found a trend suggesting that financial reward may have had a stronger effect on therapist adherence than social reward. Conclusions Incentive-based implementation strategies can be feasibly delivered in community mental health agencies with good acceptability, although iterative pilot work is essential. Larger, fully powered trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of implementation strategies to encourage and improve therapists' adherence to evidence-based practices, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.",1,1,
806,Feasibility and impact of a computerized clinical decision support system in the investigation and initial management of new-onset chest pain: a mixed-methods study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can change clinician behavior, but the factors that influence their effect remain poorly understood. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of a CDSS to support diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients with suspected stable angina. METHODS: Intervention The Optimizing Angina Management (OMA) program includes a CDSS that guides research and medication decisions for clinicians managing patients with new-onset stable angina, based on English national guidelines, presented via an educational intervention. Design and participants A mixed methods study i. A study of outcomes among patients presenting with suspected angina at three chest pain clinics in England before and after the introduction of the AOM programme. ii. Clinical process observations, interviews, and a focus group with health professionals at two chest pain clinics after delivery of the OMA program. RESULTS: Medications and cardiovascular imaging investigations performed within six months of presentation, and concordance of these with CDSS recommendations. Thematic analysis of qualitative data to understand how the CDSS was used. RESULTS: Data from 285 patients attending chest pain clinics were analyzed: 106 before and 179 after delivery of the OMA program. 40 consultations were observed, 5 clinicians were interviewed and a focus group was held after the intervention. The proportion of patients suitable for diagnostic investigation who received one was 50% (95% CI 34-66%) before AOM and 59% (95% CI 48-70%) of those after AOM. Despite the high use of the CDSS (84% of queries), observations and interviews revealed difficulties with data entry into the CDSS and structural and practical barriers to its use. In most cases, the CDSS was not used to guide real-time decision making, but was only consulted after the patient had left the room. CONCLUSIONS: The OMA CDSS for the management of chest pain is not feasible in its current form. The CDSS was not used to support decisions about the care of individual patients. A variety of barriers to the use of the CDSS were identified, some are easily removed, such as insufficient capture of cardiovascular risk, while others are more entrenched in current practice, such as the unavailability of some research or lack of viewing privileges. prescription for nurses.",0,1,
807,Feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial of telemental health with children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in underserved communities,"PURPOSE: Telemental health (TMH), the use of video teleconferencing to deliver care typically provided in person, is increasingly being used to redress disparities in access to care. However, few studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMH as a service delivery model. The Childhood Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of TMH conducted in multiple underserved communities. This article reports on the feasibility of conducting an efficacy trial of MTCT in children. METHODS: The CATTS trial used video conferencing to provide guideline-based care and secure websites to coordinate key aspects of trial implementation, including participant recruitment and retention, intervention fidelity, and completion of assessments. RESULTS: The CATTS trial involved seven communities and 150 primary care providers as study partners, enrolling 223 children ages 5.5 to 12.9 years. The intervention group completed an average of 5.3 of 6.0 planned sessions, and 96% of the controls completed a MTCT consultation. Both groups completed an average of 4.8 on the 5.0 tests. Physicians demonstrated high fidelity to their treatment protocols. Minor technical difficulties did not interfere with care. CONCLUSIONS: The CATTS trial demonstrated the feasibility of conducting an RCT of MTCT with children living in multiple underserved communities. Telecommunications technologies can facilitate the coordination of research activities between sites and clinicians. Future trials should work closely with study partners to ensure that a representative study sample is derived. Further trials are needed to help establish the effectiveness of TMH as a service delivery model. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00830700.",0,0,
808,Feasibility study of an asthma education and communication intervention for general practitioners in Australia,"The Physician Asthma Care Education (PACE) program significantly improved asthma prescribing and communication behaviors of primary care pediatricians in the US. We tested the feasibility and acceptability of a modified PACE program with Australian general practitioners (GPs) and we measured its impact on self-reported consultation behaviors in a pilot study. Recruitment was carried out through a local division of GPs. Twenty-five GPs completed two PACE Australia workshops, which incorporated pediatric asthma management according to Australian asthma guidelines and focused on effective communication strategies. Program feasibility, usefulness, and perceived benefit were measured by questionnaires before the workshop and 1 month after, and an evaluation questionnaire after each workshop. GP was universally enthusiastic and supportive of the workshops. The most helpful items they reported were communication skills, case studies, device demonstrations, and the provided set of tools. GPs' self-reports of the perceived usefulness of key communication strategies and their confidence in their application and reported frequency of use increased significantly after the workshops. The PACE program promises to improve the way Australian GPs manage asthma consultations, particularly with regard to doctor-patient communication. The impact of the modified PACE Australia program on healthcare processes and outcomes for children with asthma is now being measured in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,

810,Feedback as a strategy to change behavior: the devil is in the details,"BACKGROUND: Performance feedback is one of several strategies used to improve clinical practice among students and physicians. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper were to examine the conceptual underpinnings and essential components for audit and feedback strategies, to assess the extent to which recently published audit and feedback interventions include these components, and to recommend future directions for feedback to improve its impact. educational and behavioral. . METHODS: Based on the actionable feedback model, we examined the presence of four theoretical constructs (opportunity, individualization, lack of punitiveness, and personalization) in studies published during 2009-2010 that included a feedback intervention. RESULTS: There was wide variation in the definition, implementation, and outcomes of 'feedback' interventions, making comparison between studies difficult. None of the studies we reviewed included all components of the actionable feedback model. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback interventions reported to date, even when results are positive, often do not include behavior change concepts. This may partially explain the wide variation in approaches and outcomes of such interventions and presents great challenges in replicating any given intervention. For feedback processes to be successfully widely used, disseminated, and implemented, some standardization is needed, and certainly more clarity on the specific action steps that are taken to apply behavioral theory to practice.",0,1,
811,Fibromyalgia Treatment Update,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistently effective treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature from April 2005 to September 2006 on treatment options. RECENT FINDINGS: Previous evidence suggests that medication and self-management approaches to care can improve symptoms, function, and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and milnacipran) and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential component of any treatment plan for the fibromyalgia patient. Three studies contributed to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added to the knowledge needed for clinicians to have substantive conversations with patients. ABSTRACT: Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal approach to treatment involving evidence-based individualized pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include improvement of symptoms, primarily pain and sleep, and promotion of positive health behaviors with the goal of improving physical function and emotional well-being.",0,0,
812,Financial incentives to quit smoking during pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of a financial incentive added to routine specialist smoking cessation services during pregnancy versus usual care in helping pregnant smokers to quit. DESIGN Single-center therapeutic exploratory phase II randomized individually controlled parallel-group superiority trial. SETTING A large health council area with a materially deprived inner city population in the west of Scotland, UK. PARTICIPANTS 612 self-reported pregnant smokers in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde who spoke English, were at least 16 years of age, less than 24 weeks pregnant and had an exhaled carbon monoxide breath test result of 7 ppm or more. 306 women were randomized to incentives and 306 to control. INTERVENTIONS The control group received routine care, which was the offer of a face-to-face appointment to discuss smoking cessation and, for those who attended and set a quit date, the offer of replacement therapy of free nicotine for 10 weeks provided by pharmacy services. and four weekly support phone calls. The intervention group received routine care plus the offer of up to £400 in shopping vouchers: £50 for attending a face-to-face appointment and setting a ""quit date""; then a further £50 if four weeks after quit date exhaled carbon monoxide confirmed quit; additional £100 provided for continued validated exhaled carbon monoxide withdrawal after 12 weeks; final £200 voucher provided for validated carbon monoxide withdrawal exhaled at 34-38 weeks' gestation MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was verified cotinine cessation at 34-38 weeks' gestation via saliva (<14.2 ng/mL) or urine (< 44.7 ng/mL) Secondary outcomes included birth weight, engagement, and self-reported dropout at four weeks. RESULTS Recruitment was extended from 12 to 15 months to achieve the target sample size. Follow-up continued to sta September 2013. Of the 306 randomized women, three controls opted out shortly after recruitment; these women did not want their data used, leaving 306 participants from the intervention group and 303 from the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis. Damages from financial incentives were not documented. Significantly more smokers in the incentive group than in the control group quit smoking: 69 (22.5%) versus 26 (8.6%). The relative risk of not smoking at the end of pregnancy was 2.63 (95% confidence interval 1.73 to 4.01) P<0.001. The absolute risk difference was 14.0% (95% confidence interval: 8.2% to 19.7%). The number needed to treat (where financial incentives should be offered to achieve a further dropout at the end of pregnancy) was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 5.1 to 12.2). Mean birth weight was 3140 g (SD 600 g) in the incentive group and 3120 (SD 590) g in the control group (P=0.67).

813,FIRE (facilitating the implementation of research evidence): a study protocol,"Background Research evidence supports best practice, but it is not always used in health care. The Promoting Action on Implementation of Research in Health Services (PARIHS) framework suggests that the nature of the evidence, the context in which it is used, and whether it helps (or facilitates) those trying to use evidence affect the use of evidence. Urinary incontinence has an important effect on the quality of life of older people, has a high prevalence and is a key priority within European health and social policy. Improving continence care has the potential to improve the quality of life for older people and reduce the costs associated with providing incontinence aids. Objectives This study aims to advance understanding of the contribution that facilitation can make to implementing research findings in practice by: expanding current knowledge of facilitation as a process for translating research evidence into the practice; assess the feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of two different facilitation models in promoting the acceptance of research evidence on continence management; assessment of the impact of contextual factors on implementation processes and outcomes;"" and implement a proactive knowledge transfer and dissemination strategy to disseminate the study's findings to a broad community of policy and practice. Setting and sample Four European countries, each with six long-term nursing care facilities (24 facilities total) for people aged 60 years or older with documented urinary incontinence Methods and design Pragmatic randomized controlled trial with three arms (standard diffusion and two different facilitation schedules), with integrated processes and economic evaluation.The primary outcome is adherence to continence recommendations.Secondary outcomes include the proportion of residents with incontinence, the incidence of incontinence-related dermatitis, urinary tract infections, and quality of life. Results are evaluated at baseline, then at 6, 12, 1 8 and 24 months after the start of the facilitation interventions. Detailed contextual and process data is collected throughout, through interviews with staff, residents, and immediate family members, observations, context assessment using the Alberta Context Tool, and documentary evidence. A realist evaluation framework is used to develop an explanatory theory about what works for whom and under what circumstances.",0,0,
814,"First online survey of an international multidisciplinary working group (MightyMedic) on current practice in diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of dyslipidemias","The MightyMedic working group (International Multidisciplinary Group for Hemapheresis and Contrast Therapy of Metabolic Disorders) was founded in 2013. The main idea was to establish an international network of an interdisciplinary nature intended to work for cross-border research projects, clinical trials, educational initiatives ( meetings, workshops, summer schools) in the field of metabolic diseases, namely hyperlipidemias and diabetes, preventive cardiology and atherosclerosis. Therapeutic apheresis, its indications and techniques, is a parallel field of research. The Group's first online survey was completed in the first half of 2014. The survey included #24 Centers in Italy, Germany, Greece, UK, Sweden, Japan and the USA. Relevant data on current practice has been collected in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of dyslipidemias. In the survey, 240 subjects with hyperlipidemia and treated with lipoprotein apheresis have been reported, but a large percentage of patients (35%) who could benefit from this therapeutic option continue to be treated with a conventional pharmacological approach. Genetic molecular diagnosis is performed in only 33% of patients, while lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) is included in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk in 71% of participating centers. Further detailed investigations and prospective multicenter studies are needed to assess the impact-induced changes of updated indications and strategies, as well as new treatment options, with the aim of standardizing therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.",0,0,
815,First Episode Psychosis: A Window of Opportunity for Best Practices,"Patients experiencing a first psychotic episode or the early stages of psychosis present key diagnostic problems for clinicians. At the time of presentation of the first episode of psychosis, it is critical that clinicians select the most effective treatment option, as immediate intervention offers the best chance of containing the illness. During this period, it is also important to select the best treatment option because functional decline occurs more rapidly during this early period, which may alter the patient's future prognosis, the level of treatment needed, and affect morbidity. Although research has shown a decrease in the gray matter of the brain for those who develop psychosis along with signs of functional impairment, many patients with psychosis remain untreated for long periods of time and do not visit a doctor due to denial, fear of stigma , lack of attention. recognize the problem or complexities of your system of care. Previous studies have shown that when psychosis is left untreated, the patient's outcome is worse than that of a patient treated earlier in the course of the illness. There are a variety of treatment options for the treatment of psychosis, including the use of first or second generation antipsychotic medications. Physicians should be aware that both types of drugs are associated with certain side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia and weight gain, respectively. For both types of medications, doses should be lower for patients with a first psychotic episode than for patients with chronic psychosis. Finally, patients may present with various comorbidities, such as substance abuse, which may also affect treatment. This expert roundtable supplement will address diagnosis and treatment selection for first-episode psychosis, as well as comorbidities related to the condition. The use of first or second generation antipsychotics for the treatment of psychosis, dosage schedules, and the side effect profile of antipsychotics will also be addressed.",0,0,
816,Changing the format of a laboratory test order form affects the behavior of the doctor,"PURPOSE: Our study was designed to find out if a change in the physician's request for laboratory tests could be obtained by the simple strategy of changing the settings of the checkboxed laboratory request form that is embedded in a medical record computerized. METHODS: This prospective intervention study was conducted at Maccabi Healthcare Services, a preferred provider organization that has used a computerized medical record since 1992. We examined data from 865 primary care physicians over 3 years. In May 2005, we changed the order form and reduced the number of tests that can be ordered using a checkbox form from 51 to 26. Twenty-seven tests were removed from the form and two tests were added. The total number of laboratory test orders and the mean rate of test orders per physician visit during each of the study periods were calculated separately for each test. RESULTS: Tests added to the computerized laboratory order form showed a 60.7% increase in the first year and a further 90% increase in the following year. For tests with no changes, the percentage changes over the same periods were +18.4% and -22.4%. For the tests eliminated, the variation was -27% and -19.2% for the respective years. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the format of laboratory test request forms may change the request for medical tests and may be useful in conjunction with other interventions to improve the appropriateness of laboratory tests. A carefully crafted test order form can reinforce clinical guidelines for some preventive and follow-up tests.",1,1,
817,Formative evaluation of changes in practice for the management of depression within a Shared Care model in primary care,"Objective To investigate the implementation and initial impact of the mental health indicators of the Integrated Network of Physicians (PIN), which are specific for the detection and follow-up management of depression, in three primary care practices with Shared Mental Health Care. in Manitoba. BACKGROUND: Manitoba Health undertook a primary care renewal initiative in 2006 called PIN, which included the development of specific mental health indicators for the detection and follow-up management of depression. These indicators were implemented at three PIN group practice sites in Manitoba, which are also part of Shared Mental Health Care. METHODS: The design was a non-experimental longitudinal design. A formative evaluation investigated the implementation and initial impact of mental health indicators using mixed methods (document review, survey, and interview). Quantitative data were explored using descriptive and comparative statistics, and a content and topic analysis of qualitative interviews was performed. Responses to the survey were received from 32 of the 36 physicians at the three sites. Interviews were conducted with 15 providers. Findings This evaluation illustrated providers' perceived attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to the recognition and treatment of depression and furthered our understanding of primary care processes related to depression management related to implementation. of a new initiative. Depression is considered a major problem in primary care practice that is time consuming to diagnose, manage and treat and requires further research. Implementation of the PIN mental health indicators was variable across sites and providers. There was an increase in the use of indicators over time and a general feeling that the benefits of screening outweigh the costs"";"" however, the benefit of screening for depression remains unclear. Consistent with current guidelines, one question suggested by the findings of this evaluation is whether there are more effective ways to impact depression within primary care than screening.",0,0,
818,Fostering Implementation of Health Services Research Findings in Practice: An Established Framework for Advancing Implementation Science,"Background Many interventions found effective in health services research studies do not translate into meaningful patient care outcomes in multiple settings. Health services researchers recognize the need to assess not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to assess the extent to which implementation is effective in a specific setting, prolongs sustainability, and promotes diffusion in other settings. Many implementation theories have been published to help promote effective implementation. However, there is considerable overlap in the constructs included in individual theories, and a comparison of theories reveals that each is missing important constructs included in other theories. Also, terminology and definitions are not consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) which offers a general typology to promote the development of implementation theory and the verification of what works, where, and why in multiple contexts. Methods We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated for constructs based on the strength of conceptual or empirical support for influencing implementation, consistency in definitions, alignment with our own findings, and the measurement potential. We combined constructs across published theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapped in definition, and we analyzed separate constructs that merged underlying concepts. Results The CFIR is made up of five main domains: characteristics of the intervention, external environment, internal environment, characteristics of the people involved, and the implementation process. Eight constructs related to the intervention (eg, strength and quality of evidence), four constructs related to the external environment (eg, patient needs and resources), 12 constructs related to the internal environment (eg, patient needs and resources) were identified. eg, culture, leadership commitment), five constructs related to individual characteristics and eight process-related constructs (eg, planning, evaluating, and reflecting) were identified. We present explicit definitions for each construct. Conclusion CFIR provides a pragmatic framework for addressing complex, interactive, multilevel, and transient states of constructs in the real world by adopting, consolidating, and unifying key constructs from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide formative evaluations and build the implementation knowledge base across multiple studies and settings.",0,0,
819,Founder and recurrent mutations of CDH1 in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,"Background Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is caused by germline mutations in the epithelial cadherin gene (CDH1) and is characterized by an increased risk of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Objective To determine whether recurrent germline CDH1 mutations occurred due to independent mutational events or common ancestry. Design, Setting, and Patients Thirty-eight families clinically diagnosed with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer were pooled between November 2004 and January 2006 and tested for CDH1 mutations as part of an ongoing study at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Twenty-six families had at least 2 cases of gastric cancer with 1 case of diffuse gastric cancer in a person younger than 50 years"";"" 12 families had a single case of diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in a person younger than 35 years or multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in people older than 50 years. Main outcome measures Classification of family members as carriers or non-carriers of CDH1 mutations. Haplotype analysis was performed to assess recurrent mutations for common ancestry in 7 families from this study and 7 previously reported families with the same mutations. Results Thirteen mutations (6 new) were identified in 15 of the 38 families (40% detection rate). The 1137G>A splice mutation and the 1901C>T (A634V) splice/nonsense mutation occurred on common haplotypes in 2 families but on different haplotypes in a third family. The missense/splice mutation 2195G>A (R732Q) occurred in 2 families on different haplotypes. The 2064-2065delTG mutation occurred in a common haplotype in 2 families. Two families in this study plus 2 additional families carrying the novel 2398delC mutation shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. All 4 families are originally from the southeastern coast of Newfoundland. Due to concentrations of lobular breast cancer cases, 2 branches of this family had been diagnosed with hereditary breast cancer and were tested for BRCA mutations. Within these 4 families, the cumulative risk at age 75 years in mutation carriers for clinically detected gastric cancer was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-91%) for men and 63% (95% CI, 19%-99%) for women, and the risk of breast cancer in women carrying the mutation was 52% (95% CI, 29%-94%). Conclusions Recurrent CDH1 mutations in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer are due to both independent mutational events and common ancestry. The presence of a Newfoundland founder mutation is strongly supported.",0,0,

821,Framework for the improvement of the quality of pharmaceutical services: a bridge to cross the abyss of quality. Part I. The opportunity and the tool,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the subject of quality improvement principles and methods applied to pharmacy services and to describe a framework for current and future efforts in improving the quality of pharmacy services and the effective management of pharmacotherapy. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy developed the Catalog of Pharmaceutical Quality Indicators in 1997, followed by the Summary of National Measures of Pharmaceutical Quality in February 1999. In April 2002, the AMCP presented the Pharmaceutical Framework for Pharmaceutical Management in the XXI century. The Framework documents include a self-assessment tool that details more than 250 specific ""components"" that describe tasks, behaviors, skills, roles, duties, and responsibilities that contribute to meeting client expectations for effective medication therapy management. FINDINGS: There are many opportunities to improve quality in clinical, service, and cost outcomes related to the management of medication therapy. These may include ""patient safety""; incidence of medical errors; adverse drug events; patient adherence to therapy; achievement of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid goals; risk reduction of adverse events adverse cardiac events and osteoporosis-related fractures; patient satisfaction; risk of hospitalization or mortality;"" and cost of care. Healthcare professionals can measure improvements in the quality of medical care in a number of ways, including (a) better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) the same patient outcome at less cost, (c ) better patient outcome at lower cost, or (d) significantly better patient outcome at moderately higher cost. Measurement makes effective management possible. A framework of component factors (eg, tasks) is necessary to facilitate changes in key processes and critical factors that will help individual practitioners and health care systems meet client expectations regarding drug therapy, thus improving these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement in health care services in the United States will be accomplished through incremental changes that are based on a structure-process-outcome model. The structure is provided by evidence created from randomized controlled trials and other studies of care and system outcomes that are based on the scientific method. The process part is created by applying evidence in the form of clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice models, and self-assessment tools such as the Pharmacy Framework for Medication Therapy Management. Incremental changes in structure and process will result in the desirable outcome of meeting customer needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.",0,0,
822,Framing options as choice or opportunity: does the frame influence decisions?,"Goal. Health professionals should enable patients to make informed decisions about health care options through the fair presentation of all options. This study examined whether presenting the decision as ""opportunity"" rather than ""choice"" biased individuals' preferences in the context of participating in cancer treatment trials. Methods. Self-selected healthy women (N = 124) were randomly assigned to the following decision frames: opportunity to participate in the trial (opt-in), opportunity to be withdrawn from the trial (opt-out), and choice to have standard treatment or participate in the essay (choice). The computer-based task required women to make a hypothetical choice about a real-world cancer treatment trial. The software presented the framed scenario, recorded initial preference, presented comprehensive and balanced information, tracked participants' use of information during decision making, and recorded the final decision. A post-task paper-based questionnaire assessed perceived risk, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and satisfaction with the decision. Results. The setting influenced the women's immediate preferences. Opportunity frames, either opt-in or opt-out, introduced bias as they discouraged women from choosing standard treatment. The use of the choice framework avoided this bias. The opportunity frame of opting out also affected the social norm perceived by women"";"" women felt that others supported the trial option. Framing bias was not present once participants had the opportunity to view detailed information about the options within a patient decision aid format. There were no differences between groups in information acquisition and final decisions. Sixteen percent changed their initial preference after receiving complete information. Conclusions. A ""choice"" framework, where all treatment options are explicit, is less likely to bias preferences. Presenting the full information in parallel format, option by attribute, is likely to ""de-bias"" the decision framework. It would not be advisable to adapt the information to the initial preferences, since the preferences may change after the detailed information.",0,1,

825,From clinical evidence to daily practice: implementation of the findings of a cost-effectiveness analysis for endoscopic injection therapy for upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"BACKGROUND: An earlier trial on upper gastrointestinal bleeding showed that patients treated with repeated injections of fibrin glue for upper gastrointestinal bleeding had significantly less rebleeding than those treated with polidocanol. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost and effectiveness of repeated injection of fibrin glue and to investigate whether these results change the attitude of clinicians. DESIGN: A retrospective random sample of five hospitals from the previous study, collection of cost identification and follow-up data from 320 patients (155 in the polidocanol group, 165 in the fibrin glue group). METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and comparison of results using chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed. A survey was conducted through a questionnaire in the five hospitals on the local guidelines for the management of ulcer bleeding and its results were analyzed qualitatively. The measure of effectiveness is the number of new bleeds prevented. Other variables were length of hospital stay and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The cost of preventing one additional rebleeding by repeated fibrin glue treatment amounts to 14,316 +/- 4,981 euros (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio). There were no significant differences in the length of stays in the ICU or in the hospital. Physicians did not change their management plans for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In a survey, other factors, such as local guidelines, attitudes toward new treatment options, and ease of managing medications, were found to be more important than the result of a single study for changing physician behavior . CONCLUSIONS: The study was not prospectively designed to address a pharmacoeconomic question. Since the relevant variables (eg, length of ICU stay) could not be reliably determined retrospectively, this may lead to biased estimates of incremental cost-effectiveness.",0,0,

A Delphi questionnaire was applied to 30 experts to explore their therapeutic behavior and attitudes towards the evaluation of quality of life and adherence to treatment. A meeting with a subgroup of 10 dermatologists was held to discuss the results. A second questionnaire was answered to distinguish the decisions made for topical treatment in institutional and private practice, as well as other items not explored in the first questionnaire. After analyzing the results of the questionnaires, it was clear that the data published in the Clinical Practice Guideline and the prescriptive attitude of the experts are consistent with respect to the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis. There is also agreement in the attitude regarding the prescription of medications between private and institutional health care physicians, although in private practice the use of vitamin D analogs and corticosteroids is more common and salicylic acid replaces corticosteroids in institutions .",0,0,
827,From hypertension control to global cardiovascular risk management: an educational intervention in a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension management guidelines recommend adjusting therapeutic efforts according to global cardiovascular (CVR) risk rather than just blood pressure levels. However, this paradigm shift has not yet reached general German practice. We have evaluated the effect of an educational outreach visit with general practitioners (GPs), encouraging them to consider CVR in treatment decisions for patients with hypertension. METHODS: Prospective cluster-randomized trial comprising 3443 patients with known hypertension treated by 87 general practitioners. Practices were randomly assigned to complex (A) or simple (B) intervention. Both groups received a guide by mail"";"" group A also received a complex peer intervention that promoted the concept of global CVR. Clinical data were collected at baseline and 6-9 months after the intervention. The primary outcome was improvement in calculated CVR in the predefined subpopulation of patients with high CVR (10-year mortality >/= 5%), but without overt cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Adjusted to baseline, the follow-up CVR was 13.1% (95% CI 12.6%-13.6%) (A) and 12.6% (95% CI 12.2%-13, 1%) (B) with a group difference (A vs. B) of 0.5% (-0.2%-1.1%), p = 0.179. The group difference was -0.05% in GP patients familiar with global CVR and 1.1% in GP patients unfamiliar with global CVR. However, this effect modification was not significant (p = 0.165). Pooled by groups, the absolute reduction in CVR from baseline was 1.0%, p < 0.001. The ICC was 0.026 (p = 0.002). Control of hypertension (BP <140/90 mmHg) improved in the same subpopulation from 38.1 to 45.9% in the complex intervention group and from 35.6 to 46.5% in the simple intervention group, with adjusted follow-up control rates of 46.7% (95% CI 40.4%-53.1%) (A) and 46.9% (95% CI 40.3%-53.5% (B) and an adjusted odds ratio (A vs B) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.68-1.45), p = 0.966 CONCLUSIONS: Our complex educational intervention, including a clinical outreach visit, did not have a significant effect in CVR of patients with known high-risk hypertension compared with a simple postal intervention.",0,0,
828,From interdisciplinarity to integrated care for children with autism: the essential role of a code of ethics,"To address the developmental deficits of children with autism, several disciplines have come to the fore within intervention programs. These are speech pathologists, psychologists/counselors, occupational/physical therapists, special education consultants, behavior analysts, and physicians/medical staff. As the field of autism therapy moves toward a more comprehensive, holistic, and interdisciplinary model, the complexity of an interdisciplinary service delivery model could pose significant challenges. The difficulty of carrying out this approach could lead to substandard programs being established. Since integration across disciplines is a necessity, the ethical principles and language common to all contributing disciplines are argued as the appropriate integrating force. A summary of these principles and a draft code of ethics are provided to present high standards and expectations for all who participate in such a program.",0,0,

831,Functional recovery after myocardial infarction in men: the independent effects of social class.,"Background: Social class has been repeatedly associated with cardiovascular disease-related illness and death, but no study has examined the effect of social class on recovery from myocardial infarction. Furthermore, few studies have simultaneously evaluated a wide range of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors that may influence health outcomes after myocardial infarction. Objective: To determine whether social class remains independently associated with functional recovery after myocardial infarction, even after controlling for clinical, demographic, and psychosocial factors known to influence outcomes after myocardial infarction. Design: Prospective data analysis of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Setting: 25 hospitals or clinical settings in the United States and Canada that participated in the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial, including the Health Insurance Plan substudy. PATIENTS: 2145 men aged 29 to 69 years who were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and were recruited for the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial. Measurements: The primary outcome was change in New York Heart Association functional class between baseline and 12 months later in farction, dichotomized as improved or not improved (ie, no change, decline in at least one category, or death). Results: Social class maintained its independent effect on improved functional status, even after controlling for relevant prognostic factors. People from high social class were significantly more likely than people from low or middle social class to have improved functional status 1 year after their heart attack. Certain clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics were associated with recovery, but the effect of social class could not be explained by these additional characteristics. Conclusions: Social class has a substantial influence on recovery from myocardial infarction and may explain differences in clinical outcomes.",0,0,
832,Functional Somatic Syndromes,"The term functional somatic syndrome has been applied to several related syndromes that are characterized more by symptoms, distress, and disability than by consistently demonstrable tissue abnormalities. These syndromes include multiple chemical sensitivity, sick building syndrome, repetitive stress injury, side effects of silicone breast implants, Gulf War syndrome, chronic whiplash, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Patients with functional somatic syndromes have explicit and elaborate self-diagnoses, and their symptoms are often refractory to standard symptom reassurance, explanation, and treatment. They share similar phenomenologies, high rates of co-occurrence, similar epidemiological characteristics, and higher-than-expected prevalences of psychiatric comorbidity. Although discrete pathophysiologic causes may ultimately be found in some patients with functional somatic syndromes, the suffering of these patients is exacerbated by a cycle of self-validation and perpetuation in which common endemic somatic symptoms are incorrectly attributed to gross abnormalities, leading to reinforces the patient's belief that he or she has a serious illness. Four psychosocial factors drive this cycle of symptom amplification: ""the belief that one has a serious illness""; the expectation that one's condition is likely to worsen; ""sick role,"" including the effects of litigation and compensation""; and the alarming description of the condition as catastrophic and disabling. The climate surrounding functional somatic syndromes includes sensationalist media coverage, a deep mistrust of medical expertise and physicians, the mobilization of parties with a vested interest in the status of functional somatic syndromes, litigation, and a clinical approach that overemphasizes the biomedical and ignores the psychosocial aspects. factors All these influences exacerbate and perpetuate the somatic discomfort of patients with functional somatic syndromes, increase their fears and pessimistic expectations, prolong their disability and reinforce their role as sick. Here is a six-step strategy to help patients with functional somatic syndromes.",0,0,
833,Gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Heartburn two or more days a week requires medical attention, as patients are likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Chronic GERD can lead to the development of complications, such as erosive esophagitis, stricture formation, and Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test is the quickest and most cost-effective way to diagnose GERD, and is at least as sensitive as 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring. Because PPIs only bind to actively secreting proton pumps, they should be dosed 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. Despite these recommendations, a recent survey of more than 1,000 US primary care physicians found that 36% instructed their patients to take a PPI with or after a meal or did not specify the timing of dosing . Patients who will have the best response to surgical therapy for GERD are those who have clearly documented acid reflux with typical symptoms and who have responded to PPI therapy. Unfortunately, the same survey found that most physicians recommend antireflux surgery for patients in whom medical therapy has failed.",0,0,

835,Information search strategies of general practice practitioners for clinical queries encountered in daily practice,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that clinical consultations are common among physicians. However, data on the information-seeking behavior of general practitioners (GPs) are sparse and the numbers studied are small. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine how often and how physicians-in-training seek answers to clinical queries encountered in daily clinical practice. METHODS: Third-year trainee GPs kept records of all patient contacts for eight consecutive practice days. Information was obtained on patient contacts (description), clinical consultations (frequency, type), search behavior (frequency, timing, reason for non-search, resources used, search duration), and responses (frequency, impact). Descriptive analyzes were performed"";"" Frequencies and percentages were calculated. We calculated the number of clinical consultations per patient, the number of searches per consultation, and the number of responses per search. RESULTS: Seventy-six students reported 1,533 clinical consultations on 7,300 patients with 7,619 complaints [mean 0.2 consultations per patient, standard deviation (SD) 0.1]. For most queries, students searched for an answer (mean 0.8 per query, SD 0.2), primarily during the query (61% of searches), and responses retrieved frequently (mean 0, 8 per search, SD 0.17) reported that they improved clinical decision making by 26%. The most common resources were colleagues or supervisors (28%) and national GP guidelines (26%). The median duration of a search was 4 minutes (interquartile range 3). CONCLUSION: Physicians in training have one clinical consultation for every five patients. They often tried to find answers and reported success in most searches, mainly by consulting supervisors or colleagues and national GP guidelines.",0,0,
836,General practitioner views on the determinants of test ordering: a theory-based qualitative approach to developing an intervention to improve immunoglobulin ordering in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that variation in laboratory ordering patterns may indicate unnecessary use of the test. Serum immunoglobulin ordering patterns vary significantly among general practitioners (GPs). This study aims to explore GPs' views on testing to identify behavioral determinants and recommend feasible intervention strategies to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs requesting laboratory tests at Cork University Hospital or Kerry University Hospital in southern Ireland. GPs were identified using a list of laboratory doctors from the Cork-Kerry Region Health Service Executive. From this list, a random sample of GPs (stratified by GP request patterns) was generated. GPs were intentionally sampled according to the criteria of ""location (urban/rural)""; qualifying time; and practice size (solo/group). Interviews were conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. Interviews were transcribed verbatim using NVivo 10 software and analyzed using the frame analysis method. Emerging themes were assigned to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which describes 12 domains that can enable or inhibit behavior change. The behavior change wheel and the behavior change technique (BCT) taxonomy were used to identify potential intervention strategies. RESULTS: Sixteen GPs were interviewed (ten men and six women). The findings suggest that intervention strategies should specifically target the key barriers to effective test ordering, considering the context of primary care practice. Seven domains of TDF were perceived to influence immunoglobulin test requesting behaviors and were identified as ""mechanisms for change"" (knowledge, context and environmental resources, social/professional role and identity, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, memory, attention and decision). -processes of elaboration and regulation of behavior). Using these TDF domains, seven BCTs emerged as a feasible ""intervention content"" to address the ordering behavior of GPs. These included instructions on how to request the test effectively (how to perform the behavior), information on the use of the test by clinicians (behavioral feedback), information on the consequences for the patient that result from not performing the test test (information about health consequences), consultant-based lab/counseling/education (credible source), alter test order form (restructure physical environment), provide guidance (cues/clues), and add interpretive comments to tests results (add objects to the environment). These BCTs were aligned with four intervention functions: education, persuasion, environmental restructuring, and empowerment. CONCLUSIONS: This study has effectively applied behavior change theory to identify feasible strategies to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care using TDF taxonomy, 'behavior change wheel' and BCT. The identified BCTs will form the basis of a theory-based intervention to improve the use of immunoglobulin tests among GPs. Future research will involve the development and evaluation of this intervention.",0,0,
837,General practitioners' reasons for the failure of a randomized controlled trial (the TIGER trial) to implement epilepsy guidelines in primary care,"PURPOSE: To explore the reasons for the failure of a randomized controlled trial to influence the implementation of epilepsy guidelines in primary care and to generate a theory about the likely contexts in which the guidelines would lead to changes in clinical behaviour. METHODS: Qualitative study based on focus groups and a single in-depth interview. Participants included 47 primary health care staff selected from a purposive sample of 13 urban and rural general practices. RESULTS: The key reason for the non-implementation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network epilepsy guideline was an established pattern of GP behaviour, supported by practice staff, with little perceived need to change. Secondary to this was a lack of awareness of the existence and/or content of the guideline and perceived difficulties in implementing it in practice stemming from resource limitations and potential patient resistance. Thus, individual physician behavior was embedded in broader service structures and policies. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines are more likely to be implemented when problems with current service delivery are perceived. Attempts to facilitate guideline implementation could also focus on areas where there is already a perceived need for guidance or a disruption in one of the underlying variables that sustains the role and practice of the health professional. They may also be more likely when initiatives focus more broadly than individual medical behavior and are more broadly directed toward redesigning broader care delivery systems by bringing in other providers to provide care coordination, improve self-management of the patient and use information technology tools.",0,0,
838,Adoption of clinical practice guidelines by general practitioners: a qualitative study,"OBJECTIVE: To explain the recent rapid audited shift in the adoption of locally implemented evidence-based clinical guidelines for asthma and angina in primary care. METHODS: A case study of primary care in two adjacent matched districts in the North of England, focusing on a stratified random sample of 49 general practitioners (GPs) from eight primary care groups. Data was collected from three cycles of mainly qualitative interviews conducted at six-month intervals, before and after the dissemination of the local guidelines and after the audit data was collected. Interviews examined attitudes, awareness and impact of locally disseminated asthma and angina guidelines and subsequent audit. Audit data on guideline adoption was also available in a parallel study. RESULTS: The rapid increase in guideline acceptance observed in the intervention and control groups was not explained by individual practitioner or practice factors. The findings are attributed to physicians' knowledge of evidence-based medicine policies, new health service institutions, and clinical governance activities of primary care groups. Behavior change reflects clinicians' decisions about what to record in case notes as well as their clinical decisions, so the findings may reflect changing perceptions about responsibility rather than preferred treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline production and dissemination is best viewed in the broader context of policy change. Guideline implementation studies should report before-and-after data and incorporate meaningful qualitative components to identify important contextual factors.",0,0,
839,Surgeon General Antibiotic Stewardship: Scaling the Rogers Innovation Diffusion Curve: Prospective Cohort Study,"INTRODUCTION: The main objective of this study was to establish the concordance of the practice of prescription of the general surgeon with the local guidelines of oral intravenous antibiotics. The secondary objective was to assess the effect of introducing educational antibiotic measures. The Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Model was used to explore the adoption of antibiotic stewardship practices. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data were collected from 100 patients before and 100 after the awareness intervention program. The educational intervention included raising awareness of a) guidelines b) pre-intervention outcomes c) introduction of an information sheet on oral and intravenous antibiotics. Agreement with local guidelines was compared between groups before and after the intervention using Fisher's exact test or Pearson's Chi test (SPSS Statistics V22). RESULTS: General surgery physicians' agreement with local oral and intravenous antibiotic guidelines was poor and did not improve significantly after the awareness intervention program. There was no uptake of the antibiotic indication sheet. There was a trend towards an increase in the number of patients switching from IV to oral antibiotics at 48-72 h and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the number of patients with a clearly documented intention to review IV antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic governance measures failed to inspire even an initial group of innovators to use antibiotic fact sheets. It appears that educational measures are effective in improving behavior and intention to prescribe among a group of early adopters, but this fails to reach critical mass. To improve antibiotic governance and embark on the Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Curve, more must be done to engage surgical general practitioners in the timely and judicious prescription of antibiotics.",0,0,
840,Genetic evaluation of oocyte donors: recipient couple preferences and test results,"OBJECTIVE: To report the preferences of recipient couples for the genetic study of their oocyte donors. DESIGN: Observation report of the results of a genetic testing options form implemented as part of routine care. SETTING: Private practice. PATIENT(S): Recipients and oocyte donors. INTERVENTION(S): Recipient couples completed a form prior to evaluation of their oocyte donor that described the required evaluation and recommended tests that the couple could accept or decline. The couples received information about the frequency of carriers, the risk to their child if the results were abnormal, and the cost. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Percentage of couples who accept optional tests. RESULT(S): Of the 63 couples with available data from their first Test Choices Form, 42 (67%) accepted and 21 (33%) rejected the Fragile X test, while 34 (54%) accepted and 29 ( 46%) declined the karyotype. When asked if they would agree to further testing of their donor if recommended by a genetic counselor, 15 (24%) said they would agree to further testing regardless of cost, 35 (56%) refused, and 13 (20%) indicated their decision would depend of the cost. In many cases, the genetic counselor obtained the history or the test results influenced further testing, decisions to proceed, or provided important information for the child. CONCLUSION(S): Recipient couples sometimes chose to decline tests that we recommend but do not require, despite the relatively low cost of these tests compared to the total cost of the oocyte donation cycle.",0,0,

842,Genetic support for primary care physicians: a demonstration project,"Primary care physicians need to be supported by specialist genetics services if they are to deal effectively with the growing importance of genetics for their patients. Genetic counselors could be effective in that role. This exploratory project aimed to improve the primary-tertiary interface by pilot testing such a service for general practice for 1 year. A genetic counselor provided personalized genetic educational outreach to ten randomly selected general practices in central England over 12 months. A variety of services were provided to practices, including facilitated genetic update sessions, a responsive counseling service, and referral guidelines. The service was evaluated through pre- and post-intervention questionnaires and through seven semi-structured interviews. This article presents an overview of the development and delivery of this service and also reports on the experiences of a sample of the participants. Participants reported positive attitudes towards the service and said they had gained knowledge and confidence, as well as recognizing limitations and gaps in their current knowledge. The ongoing link to a specialized genetics service provided by a genetic counselor had a positive impact during the project and participants have continued to use the genetic counselor for advice and support with patient genetic issues since the project was completed. This is the first example of this service delivery model. More research, using a larger sample size and other measures of behavior change, is needed to assess whether this model should be adopted more widely.",0,0,
843,German translation of the Suicidal Patient Observation Chart (SPOC) - an instrument for practice,"The nursing of suicidal patients is a complex and responsible task. Direct and immediate intensive care and therapeutic supervision, also known as special observation, is still recommended in the guidelines (DGPPN, 2012) and is perhaps one of the most used interventions in the care of suicidal patients in hospital settings. It involves many types to develop the relationship between the observer and the patient. The original SPOC was developed in Sweden with the aim of increasing the quality of systematic documentation during the supervision of suicidal patients. It is a tool to ensure systematic documentation of observable behavior or perceptible mood during an acute suicidal crisis, for example feelings such as 'worried, anxious' or other potential influencing factors such as 'sudden mood swing'. In this way, the SPOC can guarantee the process of systematic documentation of special observation and increase its quality, that is, who documented what at what time. In addition, SPOC can facilitate better communication of the observation process to the multidisciplinary team and also to the patient. The SPOC includes all 28 items and covers 24 separate observation periods. The objective of this work is to constitute the translation process from the SPOC version in English to the German version. The translation process followed a five-step model. In the first step, the English version was translated by two native German speakers. In the second step, the first two results of the translation were discussed by the group of experts (authors) and a new version was developed. In the third step, the first German version (two native English speakers) was translated back into English. The fourth step was taken, reviewing the results by the groups of experts (authors) and configuring the so-called ""pre-version"". The last step includes content validity testing by 52 nurses. The test was able to identify some misunderstandings and helped improve the tool in its final version. With the translation, the German-speaking psychiatric nursing practice has a tool that can be used by psychiatric nurses regarding their complex interventions to be performed on this special group of patients.",0,0,

Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increase the risk of premature vascular disease, but the twofold increased risk associated with preeclampsia is only partially explained by the development of traditional vascular risk factors. Despite convincing evidence for gestational diabetes and HDP as indicators of vascular risk, there are no published Canadian vascular prevention guidelines that recognize these postpartum women. In contrast, the 2011 American Heart Association guidelines on cardiovascular disease in women include gestational diabetes and HDP in their assessment of vascular risk. Studies indicate that the importance of surveillance of vascular risk factors in these women after pregnancy is underestimated by the women themselves and their physicians. Although a prudent diet and physically active lifestyle were shown to reduce diabetes risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes in the American Diabetes Prevention Program trial, adoption of these health behaviors is low"";"" Qualitative studies confirm the need for personalized strategies that address barriers and provide social support. More research is also needed on approaches to reduce vascular risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes and HDP. Otherwise, an early opportunity for chronic disease prevention in high-risk young women will be missed.",0,0,

In 2008, 7.6 million deaths were attributable to cancer, which represents 13% of all deaths. It is estimated that approximately 30% of cancer deaths are attributable to the top five dietary and behavioral risks. These include a high body mass index, low consumption of fruits and vegetables, lack of physical activity, and use of tobacco and alcohol. Various viral infections, such as hepatitis B and C and HPV, are responsible for about 20% of cancer deaths. Approximately 70% of cancer deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Due to increased numbers of older people and better control of comorbidity, cancer deaths worldwide are projected to continue to rise, with an estimated 13.1 million deaths in 2030. To meet this need, the The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has become a truly international organization.

852,"Group cognitive behavioral therapy for first episodes of psychosis: who refers, who attends and who completes it?","OBJECTIVE: Most national guidelines recommend psychological therapy for people with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), but interventions that have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in research settings are not always translated. effectively in real-world clinical settings. In a limited health system, it is important to understand system and patient barriers to engaging in effective treatment. We sought to determine which patient characteristics influenced clinicians' decisions to refer or not to group cognitive behavioral therapy for FEP and which characteristics were associated with referrals who attended/did not attend and adhered/did not adhere to the programme. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2008, all confirmed FEP cases from a defined geographic region were examined using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Axis Disorders diagnoses. I of the DSM-IV-TR, the Positive Symptom Rating Scale, the Negative Symptom Rating Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and the Birchwood Insight Scale. The duration of untreated psychosis was established using the Beiser Scale. RESULTS: Of the 124 people (77 men, 47 women) in the final sample, 88 (72%) were referred for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 52 (59%) attended, and 12 (23%) did not complete CBT. Those with higher levels of knowledge about the need for treatment (U = 740.00, z = -2.63, P = 0.008) and higher levels of positive symptoms (t (120) = -3.064, P = 0.003) they were more likely to be referred. to CBT. Those with higher educational level (chi(2) = 9.48, P = 0.03) and fewer negative symptoms, particularly in relation to global attention (t (85) = 2.32, P = 0.03), they were more likely to attend and complete CBT. CONCLUSION: Within an early intervention service for FEP, it appears that people with less education, more negative symptoms, and less insight experienced significant barriers to successfully completing group CBT. More information for referring physicians about the benefits of CBT for FEP could help increase referral rates. Assertive disclosure should also be considered for individuals at risk of disengagement or non-compliance.",0,0,

DESIGN Two-arm single-blind (assessor) parallel randomized trial of a group therapy intervention in addition to usual care, compared with usual care alone. Randomisation was performed by controlling for minimization of baseline frequency of self-harm, presence of conduct disorder, depressive disorder, and severity of psychosocial stress. PARTICIPANTS Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with at least two previous episodes of self-harm in the previous 12 months. Exclusion criteria were: not speaking English, underweight anorexia nervosa, acute psychosis, substantial learning difficulties (defined by need for specialized school), current restraint in secure care. Setting Eight mental health services for children and adolescents in the North West of the UK. INTERVENTIONS A manual-based, developmental group therapy program designed specifically for adolescent self-harmers, with an acute phase of six weekly sessions followed by a booster phase of weekly groups for as long as needed. Details of routine care were obtained from participating centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the frequency of subsequent repeated episodes of self-harm. Secondary outcomes were severity of subsequent self-harm, mood disorder, suicidal ideation, and global functioning. Total costs of health, social care, education, and criminal justice sector services, plus costs related to family and productivity losses, were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and eighty-three adolescents were assigned to each arm (total n = 366). Losses to follow-up were low (<4%). For all outcomes, the trial cohort as a whole showed significant improvement from baseline to follow-up. For the primary outcome of self-harm frequency, the proportional odds ratio for group therapy versus routine care adjusted for relevant baseline variables was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.44). , P = 0.95) at 6 months and 0.88 (0.59 to 1.33, P = 0.52) at 1 year. For severity of subsequent self-harm, the equivalent odds ratios were 0.81 (0.54 to 1.20, P = 0.29) at 6 months and 0.94 (0.63 to 1.40, P = 0.75) per year. Total 1-year costs were higher in the group therapy arm (£21,781) than for routine care (£15,372), but the difference was not significant (95% CI -1416 to 10782, P=0.132). CONCLUSIONS The addition of this targeted group therapy program did not improve self-harm outcomes for adolescents who self-harmed repeatedly, nor was there evidence of cost-effectiveness. Results to endpoint for the cohort as a whole were better than current clinical expectations. ISRCTN test record 20496110.",0,0,
854,Growth and nutritional risk in children with developmental delay,"INTRODUCTION: Nutritional risk impacts the outcome of developmental delay. The main objectives were to identify the incidence and contributing factors of stunting. METHODS: Clinical data review of 500 patients with developmental delay admitted to an Early Intervention service was completed. Data were collected using the standardized parental nutrition assessment checklist before and at the time of the initial dietary assessment. The data was compared to nutritional assessment data, GOSH, and the FSAI Dietary Guidelines. Weight category was determined using RCPCH and BMI growth charts. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 (IBM Statistics 20.0). RESULTS: Nutritional risk was identified in 48.6%. Weight categories were stunted (13.5%), underweight (7.7%), overweight (8.4%), and obese (4.3%) at baseline. Growth retardation was correlated with age <1 year (p = 0.000) and with gestational age (p = 0.017), with the highest rates identified in those born between 32 and 36 weeks (3.6%) . The weight category was associated with the introduction of solids before the 17-week recommendation (10.1%), showing ANOVA significance (P = 0.013). There was poor recognition by parents of nutritional risk in 22.7% of those evaluated. Nutritional difficulties were common: 4.2% were receiving enteral feeding, 7.7% were taking prescribed nutritional supplements, 29.1% (n = 121) had feeding difficulties, and 13.9% (n = 58) had feeding difficulties. had behavioral feeding difficulties. Iron intake did not meet the recommended intake in 20.9% (n = 87), calcium in 4.5% (n = 19). The prevalence of constipation was 21.6, of which 11.8% required medical management. CONCLUSIONS: Developmental delay predisposes to nutritional deficits that influence outcome. Timely screening, evaluation, and interventions are warranted to prevent poorer developmental outcomes.",0,0,
855,Compliance with the guideline in the management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the single leading cause of death with increasing morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) to optimize pharmacotherapy for COPD patients have been updated based on the promising results of randomized clinical trials. We examined the frequency of and factors associated with physician adherence to guidelines in clinical practice at an academic medical center. METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, confirmed by spirometry, who attended outpatient clinics, were recruited. The primary outcome was provider adherence to the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Subjects were classified as either guideline-concordant receiving a rescue inhaler (all patients), or at least one long-acting bronchodilator (stage II), or at least one long-acting bronchodilator plus inhaled corticosteroid (stage III-IV). Demographic data, clinical information, and provider type were recorded. Provider type was classified as primary care physician (PCP), pulmonologist, or co-management of both. RESULTS: Of the 450 subjects who met the study criteria, 246 (54.7%) received guideline-based treatment. Age, gender, race, disease severity, and comorbidities were not associated with guideline adherence. Multivariate analysis showed that patients co-managed by a PCP and a pulmonologist were more likely to receive guideline-concordant treatment than those managed by one or the other (Odds Ratio: 4.59"";"" 95% Confidence Interval: 2.92 , 7.22, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Slightly more than half of patients with stable COPD receive guideline-concordant care. Co-management by a PCP and a pulmonologist increases the likelihood of receiving guideline-consistent inhaler therapy.",0,0,
856,Guideline Implementation in Allied Health Professions: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines aim to improve the safety and quality of patient care by providing clinicians with evidence-based, graded recommendations of best practices. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the introduction of clinical guidelines for allied health professionals and to estimate the effectiveness of the strategies for dissemination and implementation of the guidelines used. METHODS: A comprehensive search of six electronic databases up to June 2006 and the Cochrane Effective Practices and Organization of Care database was performed. Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies were included if the intervention aimed to implement the guidelines in allied health professions. The articles were selected to determine their eligibility and their methodological quality was evaluated"";"" Two reviewers extracted data independently. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied widely, with the proportion of met quality criteria ranging from 0 to 6 out of seven. In most studies, the reported effects for patient and process outcomes were small and favored the intervention group. Of the 14 included studies, 10 focused on educational interventions. Six of the 14 studies used a single intervention strategy and seven used a multifaceted implementation strategy. One study compared single and multifaceted strategies. Multifaceted interventions were not more effective than single intervention strategies and the effects of the same strategy varied between trials. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support an implementation strategy for established guidelines for allied health professionals. When implementing clinical guidelines, it is important to first identify specific barriers to change using behavior change theoretical frameworks and then develop strategies that address these barriers. When measuring the effectiveness of these strategies, practitioners should consider the use of both patient and process outcomes and choose outcomes that reflect their goals.",0,1,
857,Guideline Implementation: What the Literature Doesn't Tell Us,"BACKGROUND: Despite a large number of studies and reviews of the literature on guideline implementation, it remains unclear if and how clinical guidelines can be used to improve quality of care. This study sought to find out whether these studies and reviews have recognized the importance of systems thinking and organizational change for implementation. METHODS: A literature search for systematic reviews of guideline implementation or practice improvement studies was conducted. Each review was studied to the extent that it identified or discussed the value of systems change, organizational support, practice environmental factors, and the use of a change process. RESULTS: Forty-seven good quality systematic reviews were found. They largely agreed that the use of reminders and perhaps feedback in the course of clinical encounters were the most effective ways of implementing the guidelines. However, these same reviews rarely identified these strategies as systems change, and there was little discussion of any need for organizational support or attention to various environmental variables that might affect implementation. The change process required to introduce a new or modified practice system received even less attention. CONCLUSION: Reviews of guideline implementation trials have focused on how to change the behavior of individual clinicians. Little attention has been paid to the impact of practice systems or organizational support on clinical behavior, the process by which change occurs, or the role of the environmental context of practice within which change is attempted. A new attention to these issues can help us better understand and begin the process of improving health care delivery.",0,1,
858,'Overweight' Guideline for Children's Health Care,"The '5th National Growth Study' indicates that the percentage of overweight children in the Netherlands increased from 9 to 12% in 1997 to 13 to 15% in 2009. Child health care is a unique environment for promoting development , growth and behavior of children. children, in whom tailored prevention can be offered. The detection of overweight in children and the intervention from Child Health is developed in a multidisciplinary environment that links general practitioners, paediatricians, dietitians, teachers, physiotherapists, pedagogues and psychologists. For overweight children, a change plan is created based on exercise, playing outside, eating breakfast every day, the least possible amount of sugary drinks and fast food, and less time in front of the television or the computer, with fewer snacks energetic. As recommended in the Dutch CBO guideline 'Obesity', obese children are referred to a general practitioner or pediatrician.",0,0,
859,Early guideline-based rehabilitation after myocardial infarction. A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of individualized educational behavioral treatment delivered by cardiac nurses in hospital compared with usual care for patients after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: One hundred fourteen consecutive patients were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. Outcomes were assessed using a self-report questionnaire (Dartmouth COOP Hospital and Health Status Anxiety and Depression Scale), one month interview, and one self-report at 3 and 12 months. The primary outcome was improvement in Dartmouth COOP total score from baseline to 3 months. RESULTS: Four patients needed to be treated to give an additional patient with improved health status at 3 months (number needed to treat [NNT] 4, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 3 to 12). The intervention group was more confident in returning to activities 1 month after hospital discharge. Treated patients had fewer additional treatment needs. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized educational behavioral treatment delivered by cardiac nurses in the hospital may have substantial benefits. A pragmatic large-scale RCT is needed.",0,0,
860,Community pharmacist outreach educational guidelines and visits to improve prescribing in general practice: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of guidelines with or without personalized educational visits by community pharmacists to improve the general practice of prescribing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: Randomized cluster trial of 20 general practices in Avon, England. Practices were randomly assigned to three groups: control""; mailed guidelines;"" mailed guidelines plus educational outreach visits. General practitioners (GPs) in the latter group received two one-to-one outreach visits from community pharmacists. Changes in prescribing were measured using outcomes derived from prescription cost and analysis data (PACT). The primary outcome measure was the change in prescription volume for ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen as a percentage of the total NSAID prescription. Six secondary outcomes included other measures of prescription volume and quality. A cost-benefit analysis was performed. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the primary outcome measure: practices receiving extension visits prescribed only 2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8 to 5.0] more than all three recommended NSAIDs than control practices and 1.6% (95% CI -1.4 to 4.7) more than practices receiving guidelines only. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, only one secondary outcome showed a statistically significant difference between groups: the proportion prescribing the five most commonly used medicines was 2.2% (95% CI 0.9 to 3.6) higher in the educational outreach group compared to the control group A net increase in costs was shown with both interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Although good baseline prescribing in participating practices limited the ability for improvement, this trial provides no evidence that guidelines with or without outreach community pharmacist educational visits lead to substantial improvements in prescribing behaviour.",0,0,
861,Guidelines and psychology of medical decision making in the treatment of depressive disorders,"The guidelines aim to improve medical decision making. Guidelines attempt to influence medical behavior in contrast to textbooks and reviews that seek to improve medical knowledge. Scientific models of medical decision making, such as theory of action and empirical data on the effects of guidelines, suggest that guidelines will not always achieve their goal, but may even deteriorate medical quality. The problem of guidelines in medicine in reference to depressive disorders is discussed. The issues at stake are, however, valid for medicine as a whole. Therefore, it needs to be tested in controlled clinical trials whether physicians exposed to the guidelines have better outcomes with their patients than physicians who do not follow them. Only such guidelines should be called evidence-based for which positive effects have been empirically demonstrated.",0,0,
862,Guidelines as rationale tools: a qualitative analysis of psychosocial patient selection criteria for cardiac procedures,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac procedure guidelines often include psychosocial criteria for selecting patients that potentially introduce social value judgments into clinical decisions and decisions about the rationing of care. The aim of this study was to investigate the terms, justifications, and meanings of psychosocial patient characteristics used in cardiac procedure guidelines. METHODS: We selected English-language guidelines published since 1990 and textbook chapters published since 1989. These guidelines merged multiple sources of evidence and experience and made recommendations regarding patient selection for specific procedures. A multidisciplinary team of clinicians and social scientists extracted passages on psychosocial criteria and developed categories and conceptual relationships to describe and interpret their content. RESULTS: Sixty-five articles met the inclusion criteria for the study. Forty-five (69%) mentioned psychosocial criteria as indications or contraindications for the procedure. The latter was classified into several categories, including behavioral and psychological problems, relationships with significant others, financial resources, social roles, and environmental circumstances. INTERPRETATION: Psychosocial characteristics are described as having 2 roles in patient selection: as risk factors intrinsic to the candidate or as indicators of the need for special intervention. Guidelines often simply list psychosocial contraindications without clarifying their specific nature or providing any rationale for their use. Psychosocial considerations can help in evaluating patients for cardiac procedures, but become ethically controversial when used to restrict access. The use of psychosocial indications and contraindications could be improved with more precise descriptions of the psychosocial problem in question, explanations as to why the criterion is important, and justification of the feature using a biological rationale or research evidence.",0,0,
863,Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services: GAPS in Practice,"DESIGN: Comparison of pre- and post-Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) results collected through chart audit. SETTING: A general pediatric clinic based in a rural hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents who underwent annual examinations between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 2001. A random sample of 441 medical records was reviewed. INTERVENTION: Training in the GAPS model and use of the questionnaire began in April 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection, discussion, and referral of GAPS-related risk behaviors. RESULTS: The medical records of 162 minor adolescents (11-15 years) and 279 older adolescents (16-19 years) were audited. Detection of risk behaviors increased from 19% at baseline to 95% with initial GAPS and 87% with periodic GAPS. The most prevalent risk factor was having a rifle or pistol in the home (younger adolescents, 47% and older adolescents, 39%). The mean number of risk behaviors and documented health problems was higher in the initial GAPS (4.8 and 1.3, respectively) than in the periodic GAPS (3.8 and 0.7) (p = 0.01 and 0.006). GAPS questionnaires detected lower levels of risk behavior compared to a local Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Controlling for gender, age, and physician, discussion of psychosocial issues increased during the study period"";"" however, there was considerable variation among clinicians regarding the topics addressed. The GAPS-related referral rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The GAPS model increases the detection and discussion of risk behaviors by physicians.",0,0,
864,Guidelines for assessing postnatal problems: introducing evidence-based guidelines into Australian general practice,"BACKGROUND: Postnatal morbidity is high and many GPs lack the confidence and knowledge to treat common postnatal problems. There is a high consultation rate, but few women disclose common health problems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to increase the knowledge and skills of general practitioners so that they can identify and manage common health problems experienced by women in the year following childbirth. METHODS: An educational program [Guidelines for the Assessment of Postnatal Problems (GAPP)] integrated into a large randomized community intervention trial [Program for Resources, Information and Support for Mothers (PRISM)] with a before/after evaluation was conducted by clinicians Australians working in four metropolitan and four rural communities. The program comprised audit, interactive workshops, role plays, and evidence-based guidelines, and was assessed at baseline and at 6 months through written questionnaires and a surgery consultation with a trained simulated patient evaluator. RESULTS: A total of 68 (86%) physicians participated in the full GAPP program. The odds of a GP improving on knowledge items ranged from 1.0 to 16, with the greatest change occurring in knowledge about the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for maternal depression. Of the GPs with an incorrect response at baseline, the percentage who demonstrated better knowledge at follow-up ranged from 22% to 100%. About half of the GPs demonstrated excellent communication skills at the start of the study. Of the remaining GPs, more than half showed a great improvement in their abilities to detect common postnatal problems during follow-up. At the initial simulated patient visit, 70% of GPs asked about sexual problems but none asked about the possibility of abuse, while at follow-up 94% asked about sexual problems and 51.5% facilitated disclosure of physical and emotional abuse. Anonymous feedback on the program from participating physicians showed that 89% believed that the program positively influenced their actual practice. Interestingly, the GPs demonstrated greater knowledge and skills in the simulated environment than in the written questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively short, multifaceted educational program helped many participants improve their knowledge and skills needed to improve physical and emotional health after birth. Despite being experienced clinicians and actively participating in a program on interviewing skills, half of GPs did not facilitate disclosure of the underlying sensitive issue (abuse) during follow-up consultation and could benefit from more in-depth skills training of effective communication.",0,0,
865,"Guidelines for Family-Centered Care in the Neonatal, Pediatric, and Adult ICU","OBJECTIVE: To provide physicians with evidence-based strategies to optimize support for the family of critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: We used the Council of Medical Specialty Societies principles for clinical guideline development as a framework for guideline development. We assembled a 29-member international multidisciplinary team with expertise in guideline development, evidence analysis, and family-centered care to revise the 2007 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Family Support in the Patient-Centered ICU. We conducted a scoping review of qualitative research that explored family-centered care in the ICU. Thematic analyzes were conducted to support the development of Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions. Patients and families validated the importance of the interventions and outcomes. We then carried out a systematic review using the Recommendation Rating, Evaluation, Development and Evaluations methodology to make recommendations for practice. The recommendations were submitted to electronic voting with pre-established voting thresholds. No industry funding was associated with the development of the guideline. RESULTS: The scoping review yielded 683 qualitative studies; 228 were used for thematic analysis and development of Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome questions. The systematic review search returned 4158 reports after deduplication and an additional 76 studies were added from flags and handsearches; 238 studies met the inclusion criteria. We made 23 recommendations with a moderate, low and very low level of evidence on the topics of: communication with family members, family presence, family support, consultations and members of the ICU team, and operational and environmental aspects. We provide recommendations for future research and work tools to support the translation of the recommendations into practice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines identify the evidence base for best practices for family-centered care in the ICU. All recommendations were weak, highlighting the relative nascentness of this field of research and the importance of future research to identify the most effective interventions to improve this important aspect of ICU care.",0,0,
866,Guidelines for improving entry and retention in care and adherence to antiretrovirals for people living with HIV: evidence-based recommendations from a panel of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care,"DESCRIPTION: After HIV diagnosis, timely entry into, and retention in, HIV medical care are essential to providing effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence to ART is one of the key determinants of successful HIV treatment outcome and is essential to minimizing the emergence of drug resistance. The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care convened a panel to develop evidence-based recommendations to optimize entry and retention in care and adherence to ART for people with HIV. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to produce an evidence base restricted to randomized controlled trials and observational studies with comparators having at least 1 biological or behavioral endpoint measured. A total of 325 studies met the criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted and coded data from each study using a standardized data extraction form. Panel members wrote recommendations based on the body of evidence for each method or intervention and then rated the overall quality of the body of evidence and the strength of each recommendation. RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations are provided for monitoring entry and retention in care, interventions to improve entry and retention, and monitoring and interventions to improve adherence to ART. The recommendations cover ART strategies, adherence tools, education and counselling, and health system and service delivery interventions. In addition, they cover specific topics related to pregnant women, people deprived of their liberty, the homeless and people in poverty, children and adolescents, as well as substance use and mental health disorders. Recommendations for future research in all areas are also provided.",0,0,

Therefore, the therapeutic team was given three to five guidelines on how to treat the patient, and illustrated with possible verbatim statements to the patient. The guidelines aimed at a general interactional approach with the patient and did not determine specific therapeutic interventions. They were established following the principles of Brief Therapy as developed at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto. The results of our intervention in the treatment of ten patients are reported. The therapeutic team rated the patterns as generally positive. The therapeutic result varied a lot. A comparison with a matched-pair control group showed a favorable trend. Initial team ratings of prescriptions predicted eventual patient improvement.",0,0,

869,Guidelines for the Management of the Quality of the Apalic Syndrome/Vetative State,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiology in Europe shows steadily increasing figures for apallic syndrome (AS)/vegetative state (VS) as a consequence of advanced rescue, emergency services, intensive care treatment after acute brain injury, and activating home nursing from high level to the completely dependent end. -Cases in secondary stage to progressive neurological disease. The management of patients with irreversible permanent AS/VS has been the subject of a sustained scientific and moral-legal debate during the last decade. METHODS: A working group on guidelines for quality management of AS/VS was established under the auspices of the Scientific Panel on Neurotraumatology of the European Federation of Neurological Societies to address key issues related to the prevalence of AS/VS and the management of AS/VS. quality. The collection and analysis of scientific data on class II (III) evidence from the literature and recommendations based on best practices as a result of the experience of the members of the task force are in accordance with the EFNS Guidance regulations. FINDINGS: The overall incidence of new cases of full-stage AS/SV of all etiologies is 0.5-2/100,000 population per year. About a third are traumatic cases and two thirds are non-traumatic. Increasing rates of hypoxic brain damage and progressive neurological disease have been noted. The main conceptual criticism is based on the evaluation and diagnosis of all the different stages of AS/VS based solely on behavioral findings without knowing the exact or uniform pathogenesis or neuropathological findings and the uncertainty of the clinical evaluation due to the different evaluation criteria. inclusion. No special diagnosis, no specific medical management can be recommended for the treatment and rehabilitation of AS class II or III. This is why the sine qua non diagnoses of the clinical features and proper management of AS/VS patients in ""complete, remission, defect, and terminal stages"" require further professional training and experience for clinicians. and rehabilitation staff. INTERPRETATION: The management of AS aims at the social reintegration of patients or should guarantee active humanistic nursing if the treatment fails. The outcome depends on the cause and duration of AS/VS, as well as the age of the patient. There is no single AS/VS-specific laboratory investigation, no specific regimen, or stimulant intervention that is recommended to improve higher brain function. Quality Management requires at least 3 years of advanced training and continuing education to gain qualification approval for AS/VS treatment and experience. Sine qua non areas covering AS/SV institutions are required for early and long-term rehabilitation on a population basis (prevalence of 2/100,000/year) to accelerate functional restoration and prevent or treat complications. Care homes are needed for a respectful and humane nursing that includes basal sensory-motor stimulation techniques. Passive euthanasia is considered an act of mercy by doctors in terms of denying treatment"";"" however, ethical and legal issues regarding nutrition and hydration withdrawal and end-of-life discussions raise profound concerns. The aim of the guideline is to provide management guidance (based on the best class II and III medical evidence or work group experience) for neurologists, neurosurgeons, other physicians working with patients with AS/VS, neurorehabilitation staff, patients , relatives, and health authorities.",0,0,
870,Guidelines for Reporting Health Interventions via Mobile Phones: Checklist for Reporting and Evaluation of Mobile Health (mHealth) Evidence (mERA),"To improve the integrity of reporting of mHealth interventions, the WHO mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group developed the mHealth Evidence Assessment and Reporting (mERA) Checklist. The mERA development process consisted of convening a group of experts to recommend an appropriate approach, convening a global expert review panel for checklist development, and pilot testing the checklist. The guiding principle for the development of these criteria was to identify a minimum set of information necessary to define what the mHealth intervention is (content), where it is being implemented (context), and how it was implemented (technical characteristics), to support replication of the mHealth intervention. intervention. This document presents the resulting 16-item checklist and a detailed explanation and elaboration of each item, with illustrative reporting examples. Through widespread adoption, we hope that the use of these guidelines will standardize the quality of mHealth evidence reporting and indirectly improve the quality of mHealth evidence. #### Summary Points Mobile technologies have the potential to close the systemic gaps needed to improve access to and use of health services, particularly among underserved populations. mHealthâ€ defined as the use of mobile and wireless technologies for healthâ€ aims to capitalize on the rapid uptake of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to improve health system efficiency and health outcomes.

872,Guidelines in professions related to medicine,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in practice and promote evidence-based health care delivery. OBJECTIVES: To identify and evaluate the effects of studies on the introduction of clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visits), midwifery, and other professions related to medicine. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1975 to 1996), EMBASE, Cinahl and Sigle to 1996, the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1994 to 1996), DHSS-Data (1983 to 1996). ), the Effectiveness Review Abstracts Database (1994 to 1996), and article reference lists. We also hand-searched the journal Quality in Health Care, made personal contact with content experts, and contacted libraries identified by a panel of experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series analyzes of the introduction of interventions comparing 1. Clinical guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus no guidelines""; 2. Guidelines plus dissemination strategies dissemination and/or implementation versus guidelines plus alternative dissemination and/or implementation strategies, and 3. (post hoc) Guidelines used by allied professions versus standard healthcare Participants were nurses, midwives, and other allied professions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving more than 467 health professionals were included Reporting of study methods was inadequate for all studies. In all but one study, nurses were the professional target group;"" one study was aimed at dieticians only. The various behaviors addressed included the management of hypertension, low back pain, and hyperlipidemia. Nine studies were identified for comparison 1. Three of five studies found improvements in at least some processes of care and six of eight studies found improvements in outcomes of care. Only one study included a formal economic evaluation, with equivocal results. Three studies were identified for comparison 2, but it was difficult to draw firm conclusions due to poor methods. Six studies were identified for comparison 3 (post hoc). In general, these studies supported the hypothesis that there was no difference between nursing care using clinical guidelines and standard medical care. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that guideline-guided care is effective in changing the process and outcome of care provided by medical-related professions. However, caution is needed in generalizing the findings to other professions and settings.",0,1,
873,Guidelines on the management of smoking during the perioperative period,"Smoking is a public health problem of particular importance during the perioperative period, since it exposes patients scheduled for surgery to increased risks of 20% in hospital mortality and 40% in major postoperative complications. Furthermore, current smoking increases almost all specific surgical complications. The perioperative period offers a real opportunity to quit smoking. The preoperative smoking cessation rate can be significantly increased by offering behavioral management and prescribing a nicotine replacement before any elective surgery. Preoperative smoking cessation should be routinely recommended regardless of the time of surgery, although the benefits increase in proportion to the duration of cessation. All healthcare professionals (general practitioners, surgeons, anesthesiologists-intensivists, caregivers) must inform smokers of the positive effects of quitting smoking and offer them dedicated management and personalized follow-up. In children, parental smoking cessation or removal of the child from environmental tobacco smoke as much before surgery as possible is essential.",0,0,
874,"Guidelines, Publishers, Pharmaceuticals, and the Biological Paradigm Shift","Private investment in biomedical research has increased in recent decades. In most places it has been hailed as the next best thing to technology itself. Much of the intellectual talent in academic institutions is being absorbed into lucrative positions in industry. Applied research finds willing collaborators in the venture-funded industry, thus ensuring symbiotic growth for both. There are also significant costs involved. As academia interacts with industry, important areas of conflict of interest especially applicable to biomedical research have emerged. They are related to disputes over patents and royalties, hostile encounters between academia and industry, as well as between public and private companies, legal entanglements, research misconduct of various kinds, antagonistic press and lobbying of patient advocates and a general atmosphere in which commercial interest gets in the way. precedence over the welfare of the patient. The pharmaceutical image sucks due to a series of errors of omission and commission. A recent example is the suppression of negative results on Bayer's Trasylol (Aprotinin) and Eli Lilly's Xigris (rhAPC) marketing ploys. Whenever there is a conflict between patient vulnerability and profit motives, the pharmaceutical industry often tends to lean toward the latter. In addition, there are documents that bring to light how companies frequently cross the line between patient welfare and profit-seeking behavior. A voluntary moratorium on pharmaceutical spending is necessary to pamper drug prescribers. A code of conduct recently adopted by OPPI in India to limit drug companies' spending on travel and trinkets is a welcome step. Clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are considered important as they guide the diagnostic/therapeutic regimen of a large number of medical professionals and hospitals. and provide recommendations on medications, their doses and selection criteria. Along with clinical trials, they are another area of growing influence for the pharmaceutical industry. For example, a relatively recent survey from 2002 found that about 60% of 192 clinical practice guideline authors reported having financial connections to the companies whose drugs were under consideration. There is a strong case for making CPG based not only on effectiveness but also on profitability. The various ramifications of this need to be detailed. The work of bodies such as the Research Assessment and Guidelines Evaluation (AGREE) Collaboration and the Guidelines Advisory Committee (GAC) also deserve a close look. Even the actions of foundations working to improve disease have come under scrutiny. The process of establishing 'Best Practice' Guidelines for interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians has already begun and may have important consequences for patient care. Similarly, Good Publication Practices (GPP) have also been established for pharmaceutical companies with the aim of improving the behavior of pharmaceutical companies when reporting drug trials. The rapidly growing trend towards industry influence and control has become a concern for many. It is of such importance that the Association of American Medical Colleges has issued two relatively new documents: one, in 2001, on how to deal with individual conflicts of interest""; and the other, in 2002, on how to deal with institutional conflicts of interest in the conducting clinical research Academic Medical Centers (AMCs), as well as medical research and education institutions elsewhere, need to adopt means that minimize their conflicts of interest Both medical associations and research journal publishers are becoming concerning institutional conflicts of interest in the conduct of clinical research and available documents addressing these issues fully responsible for the design and implementation of the sayo, have independent access to all trial data and control all editorial and publication decisions. However, the findings of a 2002 study suggest that academic institutions routinely participate in clinical research that does not adhere to ICMJE standards of accountability, data access, and publication control. There is an inevitable tendency to produce not necessarily useful but marketable products that guarantee the profitability of industry and the outflow of research grants to academia. The industry supports new, non-traditional therapies, regardless of how effective they are. Whichever traditional therapy is supported is probably because the company in question has a product with a lot of interest there, that has remained a ""gold standard"" or that player thinks they still have some ""juice"" left. . Industry sponsorship is primarily for potential drugs, not for trying to determine if there might be non-drug interventions that might be just as good, if not better. In the paradigm shift to biological psychiatry, the role of industry sponsorship is not obvious, but probably more pervasive than many have realised, or correct thinking may consider good, for the health of the branch in the long run. term. An issue of great concern is protection of the interests of research subjects. Patients agree to become research subjects not only for personal medical benefit but, as an extension, to benefit the rest of the patient population and also to advance medical research. The pharmaceutical industry is huge. However, we must also accept that there is a fundamental difference between marketing strategies for other entities and those for medicines. The last barometer is the well-being of the patient and no drug that compromises it can stand the test of time. So how does it make long-term business sense to market substandard products? The biggest mistake long-term players in the industry can make is trying to adopt the shady techniques of the new upstart entrant. The secret of marketing/sales tactics, of the manufacturing process, of other strategies and business expansion plans, of strategies to face the competition are good business tactics. But it is critical that secrecy as a tactic does not extend to the reporting of research results, especially those that are contrary to one's product. Pharma has no choice but to make a quality product, do full adverse reaction profiles, and market it only if it passes both tests. .Why is the pharmaceutical industry adopting questionable tactics? The reasons are essentially two: with all the limitations, a drug reaches the pharmacy after large investments. There are crippling overhead and infrastructure costs to recover. And there are massive profit margins that need to be maintained. If these were to depend solely on genuine drug discoveries, that would be taking too great a risk. Industry players must strike the right balance between profit generation and credibility. In making a profit, marketing champions play their part. In credibility ratings, researchers and paid spokespersons play their part. Everything is going from strength to strength until marketing is based on credibility. When nothing is available to build credibility, something is projected as one and marketing is done, in the calculated hope that profits can be accrued, as profit making must continue unabated. That is what makes the pharmaceutical industry adopt even questionable means to make a profit. Essentially, there are four types of medications. First, drugs that work and have minimal side effects; second, drugs that work but have serious side effects; third, drugs that don't work and have minimal side effects; and fourth, drugs that work minimally but have serious side effects. It is the second and fourth types that create the biggest problems for the industry. Often the industry may try to cast The Fourth Guy as the second to escape censorship. The main game is to prevent the second type from projecting as the first. The third type is essentially harmless, thus attracting censorship and some mirth from antics to market them. But they escape anything more than a light tap on the knuckles. , except when they are cast as the first type. What is necessary for captains of industry and long-term players is to realize: Your main driving force can only be producing the first type. 2. They accept the second type. just until they can get their hands on the first one. 3. You can occasionally play the third type to shore up profits, but never project them like the first type. 4. The fourth type is the laggards, a real threat to credibility and therefore not worthy of any publicity or market promotion. Finding out why most drug companies indulge in questionable tactics, we found some interesting solutions to avoid such tactics with the least amount. of inconvenience for all involved, even though both profits and credibility remain intact.",0,0,
875,Guidelines-based indicators for measuring the quality of antenatal care,"RATIONALE, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: There is no comprehensive measurement of the quality of prenatal care. Late booking or low number of checks are often used as proxies for poor quality, leading to uncertainty about the actual content of care received. To fill this gap, we have reviewed two sets of clinical guidelines and developed corresponding quality indicators. METHOD: A group of physicians and methodologists reviewed the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Clinical Guidelines on antenatal care and the list of antenatal care interventions recommended by the Research and Development Group, both based on evidence of the effectiveness of specific interventions . We identify unique aspects in three domains: (1) use of services; (2) detection; and (3) interventions. For each indicator, we define: (1) eligibility, that is, the characteristics of the women to whom the indicator applies. ; (2) standard, which is the situation when the objective is met;"" and (3) moderators, that is, all the conditions that legitimately hinder compliance with the norm. RESULTS: We developed four service utilization indicators, 25 screening and intervention 17. For each indicator, the respective eligibility, standard, and moderating criteria were described. While many indicators can be retrospectively assessed from medical records, the quality of communication with the provider, the detection of sensitive problems, and the advice on behaviors to avoid can only be obtained with prospective data collection CONCLUSIONS: Indicators of quality of antenatal care, complemented by measures of social position, social support and ethnic/immigrant status, allow careful description of gaps in the quality of care for specific groups of women.",0,0,
876,Stopping antipsychotic use in long-term care (HALT): a single-arm longitudinal study aiming to reduce inappropriate antipsychotic use in long-term care residents with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) continues despite revised guidelines and evidence of associated risks and side effects. The goal of the Stopping Antipsychotics in Long-Term Care (HALT) project is to identify residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities who are taking antipsychotic medications and undertake an intervention to deprescribe (or discontinue) these medications and improve non-pharmacological health. behavior management METHODS: The LTC facility will be contracted in Sydney, Australia. The inclusion criteria for residents will be older than 60 years, with regular antipsychotic medication and without a primary psychotic illness or very severe SCPD, measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The data collection will be carried out one month and one week before the start of the deprescription"";"" and 3, 6 and 12 months later. During the pre-deprescription period, training will be provided to care staff on how to reduce and manage SCPD using person-centered approaches, and academic information will be provided to participants' GPs. The primary outcome measure will be the reduction of regular antipsychotic medication without the use of substitute psychotropic medications. Secondary outcome measures will be NPI total and domain scores, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores, and adverse events, including falls and hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: While previous studies have outlined strategies to minimize the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in people with dementia living in long-term care, sustainability and a prescribing culture of BPSD in elderly care remain challenges. The HALT project aims to assess the feasibility of a multidisciplinary approach to deprescribing antipsychotics in this population.",0,0,

882,"Health information, behavior change and decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes: development of a tailored and preference-sensitive health communication application","PURPOSE: Patient involvement in diabetes management, such as shared decision-making and patient self-management, has significant effects on clinical parameters. As a prerequisite for active participation, patients must be adequately informed and sensitive to their preferences. Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCA) that combine web-based health information for patients with additional support offer the opportunity to reach large numbers of patients at low cost and provide them with high-quality information and support in the moment, the location and rate of learning. they prefer. Still, web-based interventions often suffer from high attrition. Tailoring the intervention to patients' needs and preferences could reduce attrition and therefore should increase effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to develop a personalized IHCA that offered evidence-based, preference-sensitive content and treatment decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes. The content was developed based on a needs assessment and two guidelines. evidence-based treatment. The delivery format is a dialogue-based tunneled design that tailors the content and tone of the dialogue to relevant patient characteristics (health education, attitudes toward self-care, and psychological barriers to insulin treatment). Both content and adaptation were reviewed by an interdisciplinary advisory committee. CONCLUSION: The World Wide Web has great potential for patient information and self-management interventions. With the development and evaluation of a personalized IHCA, we complement the face-to-face consultations of patients with their health professionals and make them more efficient and satisfactory for both parties. The effects of the app are currently being tested in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,
883,"Health literacy training for public health nurses in Fukushima: a case study of program adaptation, implementation and evaluation","Health literacy encompasses not only an individual's ability to access, understand, and use health information, but also the ability of health care providers to make health information accessible and usable. The Fukushima nuclear accident has posed challenges related to the communication of radiation-related health information. Public health nurses are gatekeepers of community health in Japan and have primary responsibility for communicating this complex science and risk information to lay members of the community. A health literacy training program was designed to increase the communication skills of participating nurses with two main goals: to change communication practices and norms among public health nurses and to improve access to information for residents of the public health unit. community. Training content incorporated an overview of health literacy skills (including numeracy), processes for evaluating written materials and visual presentations, and guidelines for improving text. The workshop was spread over two days with two-hour sessions each day. A post-training proximal evaluation survey was conducted, followed by a more distal one-month follow-up evaluation to assess the application of learned skills in practice. Twenty-six nurses from the city of Fukushima attended the first trial. Post-training evaluations were very positive, with 85-100% agreement by participants on the appropriateness and usefulness of the workshop. During a one-month follow-up, the nurses reported applying new knowledge and skills to develop written materials. However, they faced difficulties in sharing their new skills with colleagues and challenges in changing work regulations. Participants also found it difficult to use graphics and explain risks in practice. This document highlights the importance of providing health literacy training opportunities for professionals to strengthen the capacity of the health system to provide accessible information and services. This program also serves as an important reference for future disaster management efforts.",0,0,
884,Attitudes of health professionals towards the management of acute diarrhea,"BACKGROUND: Traveler's diarrhea is the most common health problem in those involved in international travel, and is responsible for many consultations abroad and on return home. METHODS: A questionnaire to assess attitudes towards the treatment and management of travel-related and non-travel-related diarrhea was administered to 542 GPs, nurses and pharmacists. RESULTS: Health professionals' attitudes toward the management of acute diarrhea are variable, with marked divergence regarding adherence to published ""good practice"" guidelines and recommendations. There are inconsistencies in stated attitudes towards prescribing antispasmodic and antimotility agents and actual prescribing behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatment guidelines may be outdated. Inappropriate or late treatment harms the patient. Limiting the use of antidiarrheal agents may deny diarrhea sufferers access to medication that can shorten symptoms and morbidity, and hasten a return to normalcy. Revision of guidelines for the management of diarrhea in adults is overdue, as is standardization of response to treatment. Educational initiatives are required to encourage active intervention and improvement of care delivery.",0,0,
885,Health Promotion in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors: Mobilizing Compliance in a Multifaceted Risk Profile,"With increasing cure rates for childhood cancer, nurses are more likely to encounter a large cohort of survivors in practice. There are a variety of late effect programs"";"" however, funding is limited for these programs and not accessible to all patients. Primary providers can increasingly act as a medical home for childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Understanding the inherent risks of cytotoxic therapy and the progressive consequences of late effects is vital to limiting morbidity and mortality. Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors are particularly apt to make behavioral health decisions that create risks for comorbidities. Developmentally appropriate experimentation with the use of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco and increased exposure to ultraviolet rays increase the risk of secondary malignancies and new diseases. The dearth of evidence-based surveillance guidelines and survivor-specific health promotion programs cumulatively increases the gap in noncompliance and misinformation. This article summarizes the risk profile of CCS. It explores health practices, as well as emerging health promotion techniques, within the AYA survivor population and the role nurse practitioners have in improving health maintenance.",0,0,

Health. However, HSG development, evaluation, and reporting pose unique conceptual and methodological challenges related to the various types of evidence that are relevant, the complexity of health systems, and the pre-eminence of contextual factors. To address this gap, we are conducting a research program that aims to create a tool to support HSG assessment and further improve HSG development and reporting. The focus of this paper was to conduct a knowledge synthesis of the gray and published literature to determine the quality criteria (concepts) relevant to this process. Methods We applied a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) approach to knowledge synthesis that enabled an iterative, flexible, and dynamic analysis of various bodies of literature to generate a candidate list of concepts that will constitute the fundamental components of the HSG tool. Using our review questions as compasses, we were able to guide the search strategy to find documents based on their potential relevance to HSG assessment, development, and reporting. The search strategy included various databases and electronic sources, journals, conference proceedings, research reports, book chapters, unpublished data, dissertations, and policy documents. Article selection and data extraction were completed independently and in duplicate, and a narrative approach to data synthesis was executed. Results 43 articles were identified that met the eligibility criteria. No existing review on this topic was found and no HSG assessment tool was identified. More than a third of the authors implicitly or explicitly identified the need for a high-quality tool aimed at systematically assessing HSG and contributing to its development/reporting. We identified 30 concepts that may be relevant to HSG assessment and were able to group them into three meaningful domains: process principles, content, and context principles. Conclusions Our study showed the role that quality criteria play in HSG development, evaluation and reporting and demonstrated the link and resonance within and between the various concepts in the three domains.",0,0,

Self-monitoring devices included those that help patients manage diabetes and prevent cardiovascular complications (CVC). A secondary objective was to explore issues of feasibility, usability, and compliance among patients and providers. METHODS: Study criteria included people > or = 14 years and youth (7-14 years) with DM1 or DM2, intervention with a self-monitoring device, assessment of clinical outcomes with the device, English literature, and > 10 participants. Relevant published literature from 1985 to 2008 was searched. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Data were extracted for clinical outcomes, feasibility and compliance methods, and outcomes. Selected studies were independently assessed with a validated instrument to assess methodological quality. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were selected. The predominant types of device interventions included self-monitoring of blood glucose, pedometers, and cell phones or wireless technologies. Feasibility and compliance were measured in most studies. CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring of blood glucose remains an effective tool for diabetes control. Wireless technologies can improve diabetes self-management, and pedometers are effective tools for lifestyle changes. The results of this review indicate the need for further investigation of controlled trials on existing and novel technologies for diabetes self-management, on health outcomes associated with diabetes and CVCs, and device feasibility and compliance.",0,0,

889,Hand decontamination practices of healthcare workers: adherence to recommended guidelines,"OBJECTIVE: This article reports on a study of health care workers' handwashing/hand hygiene practices from a behavioral perspective. BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infection represents a very real and serious threat to all who are admitted to hospital. Pathogens are easily transmitted on the hands of healthcare workers, and hand hygiene substantially reduces this transmission. There are evidence-based guidelines for hand hygiene practices for healthcare workers, but compliance with these is low internationally. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design with a convenient sample was used. The predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling constructs in diagnostic and educational evaluation Theory of Health Education were used as a theoretical framework, and data were collected in 2001. Handwashing practices of health workers (observation of behavior , n = 314) and their predisposition (attitudes, beliefs and knowledge) towards compliance with hand hygiene guidelines (questionnaire, n = 62). The study involved nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and care assistants involved in direct patient care in the study unit. The hand hygiene intervention program aimed to predispose healthcare workers to adopt hand hygiene behavior (poster campaign and educational brochure), reinforce (feedback on pre-test results), and enable the behavior (Provide alcohol-based hand sanitizer at each patient's bedside.) RESULTS: Implementation of the multifaceted interventional behavioral hand hygiene program resulted in an overall improvement in adherence to hand hygiene guidelines (51-83%, P < 0.001). In addition, the health workers believed that their skin condition had improved (P < 0.001). An increase in knowledge about handwashing guidelines was also found. CONCLUSIONS: To be effective, efforts to improve compliance with handwashing guidelines must be multifaceted. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (with emollients) need to be provided at each patient's bedside. Problems related to skin irritation in healthcare workers need to be addressed urgently.",1,1,
890,Health workers' self-reported effect of an intervention program on knowledge and behavior related to infection control,"INTRODUCTION: Adherence to infection control guidelines is low and several efforts have been made to improve the performance of health workers in infection control measures. In this study, the performance and evaluation of a hospital-wide infection control program is described. The most important measure was the distribution of an infection control bulletin. METHODS: In the program evaluation, a random selection of health workers received a questionnaire to investigate the extent to which the health workers were aware of the program and whether they reported behavioral changes and updated knowledge as a result of the program. RESULTS: The intervention made it possible to reach >80% of the staff of a Norwegian university hospital. Among those who actually read the Infection Control Bulletin, 92.9% reported that their knowledge was updated and 60.6% reported a change in behavior. DISCUSSION: The intervention had a significant impact on the reports of nurses and nursing assistants about knowledge and behaviors related to infection control. Our study supports the importance of a long-term, multimodal approach for healthcare workers in infection control work. The time and resources spent producing and distributing the Infection Control Newsletter was an effective way to reach a large number of healthcare workers.",0,0,

Despite this, and a growing evidence base for effective lifestyle interventions, there is limited uptake in survival care. METHODS/DESIGN: Healthy Living after Cancer (HLaC) is a national dissemination and implementation study that will evaluate the integration of an evidence-based lifestyle intervention for cancer survivors into a telephone cancer information and support service provided by the Australian State Cancer Councils. . Eligible participants (adults who have completed cancer treatment with curative intent) will receive 12 health coaching calls over 6 months from Cancer Council nurses/allied health professionals on national guidelines for physical activity, healthy eating and weight control.

DESIGN Mendelian randomization study to test the causal effects of differences in height and BMI on five measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian randomization exploits the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at conception and thus are not confounded by non-genetic factors. SET UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS 119,669 men and women of British descent, aged between 37 and 73 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age completed with full-time education, education level, job class, annual household income, and Townsend index of deprivation. RESULTS In the UK Biobank study, shorter height and higher BMI were observationally associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status. The associations between shorter height and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in men, and the associations between higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in women. For example, a BMI higher than 1 standard deviation (SD) was associated with Ã‚Â£210 (Ã¢â€šÂ¬276""; $300; 95% confidence interval Ã‚Â£84 to Ã‚Â £420; P = 6 × 10(-3)) lower annual household income for men and £1,890 (£1,680 to £2,100; P=6 × 10(-15)) lower annual household income for women. Genetic analysis provided evidence that these associations were partly causal.A genetically determined taller height 1 SD (6.3 cm) caused a 0.06 (0.02 to 0.09) years older age at completing school on time full (P = 0.01), at 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18) times more likely to work in a skilled profession (P = 6 × 10 (-7)), and £1,130 (£680 at £1580) higher annual family income (P=4 × 10(-8)). Associations were stronger in men. A higher genetically determined BMI 1 SD (4.6 kg/m(2)) caused an increase of £2,940 (Ã‚ £1,680 to £4,200;"" P = 1 × 10 (-5)) lower annual family income and deprivation level 0.10 (0, 04 to 0.16) SD (P = 0.001) higher only in women. CONCLUSIONS These data support the evidence that height and BMI play an important partial role in determining various aspects of a person's socioeconomic status, especially women's BMI for income and deprivation and men's height for education. income and job class. These findings have important health and social implications, supporting the evidence that overweight people, especially women, are at a disadvantage and that taller people, especially men, are at an advantage.",0,0,
894,Management of Helicobacter pylori: how to improve therapeutic confusion in practice,"There appears to be a disconnect between current guidelines for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment and clinical practice, including clinicians' beliefs and actual prescribing patterns. In particular, there are markedly different approaches in primary and secondary care, and country-specific differences in eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. Although most clinicians do not believe that H. pylori causes nonulcer dyspepsia, most seem to prescribe eradication. Less information is available on the treatment of H. pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and in this condition there are more marked differences in attitudes and practice. Even in peptic ulcer disease, where most clinicians in both primary and secondary care believe that H. pylori should be eradicated, there is often a breakdown in the translation of this belief into practice. There is also confusion regarding the treatment regimens applied for the eradication of H. pylori. Eradication regimens are less successful in practice than in clinical trials. In addition, a considerable proportion of peptic ulcer patients remain symptomatic despite healing of the ulcer diathesis, which may undermine confidence. Therapeutic confusion about what to prescribe, compliance-limiting side effects, bacterial resistance, and socioeconomic factors may affect therapeutic success with eradication therapy in practice. Unfortunately, it has been well documented that the guidelines alone are likely to have little or no impact in practice. Publication in a journal is unlikely to lead to effective implementation in primary care. Based on the available evidence, clinical behavior is most likely to change when guidelines are developed by the group of clinicians for whom they were intended, disseminated through a specific educational program, and implemented through application, preferably during consultation, specific reminders. .",0,0,
895,Help doctors and patients understand health statistics,"Many doctors, patients, journalists and politicians do not understand what health statistics mean or inadvertently draw the wrong conclusions. Collective statistical illiteracy refers to the generalized inability to understand the meaning of numbers. For example, many citizens are unaware that higher survival rates with cancer screening do not imply a longer life, or that the claim that mammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by 25% means that 1 woman less than every 1,000 will die from the disease We provide evidence that statistical illiteracy is (a) common to patients, journalists, and doctors""; (b) created by a non-transparent reporting framework that is sometimes an unintended result of lack of understanding, but can also be the result of intentional efforts to manipulate or persuade people, and (c) can have serious health consequences The causes of statistical illiteracy should not be attributed solely to cognitive biases, but to the nature of the doctor-patient relationship and conflicts of interest in the health system The classic doctor-patient relationship is based on paternalism (of the doctor) and trust a (of the patient) in authority, which makes statistical literacy seem unnecessary""; so does the traditional combination of determinism (doctors looking for causes, not chance) and the illusion of certainty (patients looking for certainty when there is none). We show that information brochures, websites, brochures distributed to doctors by the pharmaceutical industry, and even medical journals often report evidence in non-transparent ways that suggest high benefits of the interventions presented and little harm. Without understanding the numbers involved, the public is susceptible to political and commercial manipulation of their anxieties and hopes, undermining the goals of informed consent and shared decision-making. What can be done? We discuss the importance of teaching statistical thinking and transparent representations in primary and secondary education, as well as in medical school. However, this requires familiarizing children early on with the concept of probability and teaching statistical skills as the art of solving real-world problems rather than applying formulas to toy problems about coins and dice. An important precondition for statistical literacy is transparent risk communication. We recommend using frequency statements instead of single-event probabilities, absolute risks instead of relative risks, mortality rates instead of survival rates, and natural frequencies instead of conditional probabilities. Psychological research on transparent visual and numerical forms of risk communication is required, as well as training of clinicians in their use. Statistical literacy is a necessary precondition for an educated citizenry in a technological democracy. Understanding the risks and asking critical questions can also shape the emotional climate in a society so that hopes and anxieties are no longer so easily manipulated from the outside and citizens can develop a more informed and relaxed attitude towards their health.",0,1,
896,Helping Hands: A Cluster Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy of Two Different Strategies to Promote Hand Hygiene in Hospital Nurses,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene prescriptions are the most important measure in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections. However, compliance rates are generally below 50% of all hand hygiene opportunities. This study aims to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of two different strategies to promote hand hygiene in hospital nurses. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial with inpatient wards as the unit of randomization. Guidelines for hand hygiene will be implemented in this study. Two strategies will be used to improve adherence to hand hygiene guidelines. State-of-the-art strategy is derived from the literature and includes education, reminders, feedback, and selection of appropriate products and facilities. The expanded strategy also contains activities aimed at influencing social influence in groups and improving leadership. The unique contribution of the extended strategy is based on relevant theories from the behavioral sciences. The extended strategy includes all the elements of the leading edge strategy supplemented by eliciting the active commitment and initiative of the district administration, modeling by informal leaders in the district, and setting norms and goals within the team. Data will be collected at four points in time, with six-month intervals. An average of 3,000 opportunities for hand hygiene will be observed by approximately 900 nurses at any one time. DISCUSSION: Carrying out and evaluating an implementation strategy that also targets the social context of teams can greatly increase the overall body of knowledge in this field. The results of our study will allow us to draw conclusions about the effects of different strategies for the implementation of hand hygiene guidelines and, based on these results, we will be able to define a preferred implementation strategy for hospital nursing.

897,"Helping someone with a drug use problem: a Delphi consensus study of consumers, caregivers, and clinicians.","BACKGROUND: Problematic illicit drug use (ie, drug abuse or dependence) is associated with considerable health and social harms, highlighting the need for early intervention and engagement with health services. Family, friends and colleagues play an important role in supporting and helping people with drug use problems to seek professional help; however, there are conflicting views on how and when such support should be offered. This document reports on the development of mental health first aid guidelines for problem drug use in adults, to help inform community members on how to help someone who develops problem drug use or is experiencing a related crisis. with drugs. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific and non-specialist literature was conducted to develop a 228-item survey containing possible first aid strategies to help someone who develops a drug problem or is experiencing a drug-related crisis. Three expert panels (29 consumers, 31 caregivers, and 27 clinicians) were recruited from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Panel members independently rated the items in three rounds, and the strategies reached a consensus on importance written into the guidelines. RESULTS: The overall response rate across all three rounds was 80% (86% consumers, 81% caregivers, 74% physicians). 140 first aid strategies were endorsed as essential or important by 80% or more of panel members. Supported strategies provide information and advice on what problem drug use is and its consequences, how to approach a person about their problem drug use, tips for effective communication, what to do if the person is unwilling to change their drug use, drugs, what to do if the person wants (or doesn't want) professional help, what are drug-affected states and how to manage them, how to deal with adverse reactions that lead to a medical emergency, and what to do if the person is aggressive. CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines provide a consensus-based resource for community members who want to help someone with a drug problem. The guidelines are expected to lead to better support and understanding for people with drug use problems and to facilitate participation with professional help.",0,0,

899,Liver reactions associated with ketoconazole in the UK,"Ketoconazole was introduced in the UK in 1981. By November 1984, the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug, including five deaths. An analysis of the 75 cases that had received adequate follow-up suggested that 16, including three deaths, were likely related to drug treatment. Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely to be related, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of the patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9 years, with hepatotoxicity being more frequent in women. The mean duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days. None of these well-validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. Serum liver function test results suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 (63%)"";"" the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. The characteristics of the 48 patients of the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. The hepatitis was generally reversible when treatment was stopped, with liver function test results returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of the three deaths likely associated with ketoconazole treatment, the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis. Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is recommended during long-term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious liver damage.",0,0,
900,Hepatitis Competence Network (Hep-Net),"In Germany, almost 1 million people are affected by chronic viral hepatitis. Despite improved therapeutic options for the treatment of hepatitis B and C, several issues related to epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy remain unclear. Vaccines against hepatitis C and D viruses are not yet available. In addition, many patients and their families need information about infectiousness, disease course, and treatment options. By integrating medical practices and patient advocacy groups, Hep-Net aims at educating information about the infection and seeks to provide access to qualified therapy strategies for all patients with an indication for therapy. After 18 months, the Hep-Net home page already shows more than 9,000 hits per day. Telephone consultation hours, e-mail services and numerous activities in cooperation with Deutsche Leberhilfe eV are very popular. At the Hep-Net study house, high-level clinical studies with the first successful results are organized centrally. Furthermore, basic questions in the fields of epidemiology, virology and immunology are processed in cooperative research projects within the network.",0,0,

902,Herd: a new phenomenon affecting medical decision-making in multiple sclerosis care? Lessons learned from DISCUSS MS,"PURPOSE: Herding is a phenomenon by which individuals follow the behavior of others rather than decide independently based on their own private information. A herd phenomenon in multiple sclerosis (MS) can occur when a neurologist follows a colleague's therapeutic recommendation, even if it is not supported by best practice clinical guidelines. Limited information is currently available on the role of herding in health care. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence (and its associated factors) of grazing in the management of MD. METHODS: We conducted a study among neurologists with experience in MS care throughout Spain. Participants answered questions about the management of 20 commonly encountered case scenarios in clinical practice and completed 3 surveys and 4 experimental paradigms based on behavioral economics. The grazing experiment consisted of a case scenario of a 40-year-old woman who has been stable for 3 years on subcutaneous interferon and developed a self-limited neurological event. There were no new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. His neurological exam and disability scores did not change. A neurologist specializing in multiple sclerosis advised him to switch from interferon to fingolimod against best practice guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with grazing. RESULTS: Of the 161 neurologists who were invited to participate, 96 completed the study (response rate: 60%). The herd was present in 75 (78.1%), with a similar prevalence in MS experts and general neurologists (68.8% vs 82.8%"";"" P=0.12). In multivariate analyses, the number of MS patients seen per week was positively associated with grazing (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.14). In contrast, physician age, gender, years of practice, practice setting, or risk preferences were not associated with herding. CONCLUSION: Herding was a common phenomenon affecting nearly 8 out of 10 neurologists caring for MS patients. Grazing can affect medical decisions and lead to worse outcomes in MS treatment.",0,0,

904,Heterogeneous demographic and cultural profiles of nonadherent Chinese-American patients for colorectal cancer screening: a latent class analysis,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in Chinese Americans, but its CRC detection rates remain low. OBJECTIVE: We examined subgroups of Chinese American patients who do not meet CRC screening guidelines to better inform clinical practices to effectively promote screening. METHODS: Using latent class analysis of data from 327 participants recruited from 18 primary care clinics, we classified nonadherent patients based on sociodemographics, screening barriers, and clinical and attitudinal factors for CRC detection. . RESULTS: The best-fit latent class analysis model described 3 distinctive classes: Western health care class (36%), Eastern health care class (18%), and Mixed health care class (46%). Patients in the Western health care class were highly educated, with an average US residence of 20 years, a high level of English proficiency, the least Eastern cultural views of care, and the greatest exposure to doctors' recommendations, but reported that they did not have time for screening tests. Patients in the Eastern health care class were highly educated seniors and recent immigrants with the least knowledge of CRC and the most Eastern cultural views. Patients in the mixed health care class had a low level of education, resided in the United States for 20 years, and half had sought the services of their physicians for at least 3 years, but their knowledge and cultural views were similar to those of Eastern health care class patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherent Chinese American patients are heterogeneous. Tailored future intervention programs to address beliefs and screening barriers specific to non-adherent patient subtypes are essential. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Training primary care physicians to recognize different patient demographics and health care beliefs may facilitate physicians' communication with patients to overcome their barriers and improve management behaviors. detection.",0,0,
905,Heterogeneous Effect of an Emergency Department Expert Chart System,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compared the results of different modules (occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, low back pain and fever in children) of the Emergency Department Expert Registry System. Each module of this electronic health record provides real-time advice based on clinical guidelines embedded in the software. METHODS: We used an intermittent interrupted time series design with an intention-to-treat analysis to implement the Emergency Department Expert Registry System in the emergency department of a university hospital for the treatment of pediatric fever, low back pain, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids. We measured quality of documentation as percentage of essential elements contained in medical history and discharge instructions, percentage of appropriate tests and treatment decisions, median charges per patient visit, physician satisfaction through pre-questionnaires and after the experiment, and patient satisfaction through a telephone questionnaire. RESULTS: The Emergency Department Expert Registration System improved documentation rates for all modules. The Emergency Department Expert Record System consistently improved the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and treatment decisions for patients with occupational exposure to blood and body fluids while lowering average charges. For the child low back pain and fever modules, improvements in appropriateness of testing and treatment were less consistent and did not result in a decrease in charges. Although physicians generally supported the intervention, use of the Emergency Department Expert Record System and physician satisfaction with the modules were higher with occupational exposure to blood and body fluids and less with fever in children . For each complaint filed, mean patient satisfaction was highest during the emergency department expert registration system phase. CONCLUSION: Guideline delivery via an electronic medical record with history decision support improved documentation, patient care, and patient satisfaction, although effects were heterogeneous across complaints filed. The optimal guideline implementation strategy is likely to vary depending on the nature of the clinical problem and the type of healthcare setting. For selected problems, delivery of guidelines in this format via the Internet holds great promise for changing physician behavior and improving care (see http://www.needlestick.mednet.ucla.edu).",0,1,
906,High-risk management guidelines for suicidal older patients in primary care settings,"Older adults, especially older white men, are more likely to commit suicide than other age groups. The assessment and management of suicidal ideation and behavior in the elderly is especially relevant to primary care physicians because many patients visit their physician shortly before committing suicide. In 1993, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care settings. The AHCPR guidelines offered some help with regard to detection and treatment of patients with suicidal tendencies. However, these guidelines lacked detailed and specific instructions for the management of high-risk patients within the context of intervention research. The current set of guidelines builds on this previous work by describing (1) a general approach to interacting with suicidal patients""; (2) structured assessments to determine degree of suicide risk; (3) crisis intervention strategies""; and (4) ongoing management procedures for working with suicidal patients in primary care settings.",0,0,
907,Historical background of changes in FDA policy on the study and evaluation of drugs in women,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made two important changes to its policy for the study and evaluation of drugs in women: (1) analyzes of the safety and efficacy of specific drugs will be required by sex as part of all new drugs. and (2) it will no longer be recommended that women of childbearing age be restricted from participating in early drug trials. These changes have come about as a result of ongoing efforts to individualize therapy, improve drug safety and efficacy, and answer important questions about whether the drug development process produces adequate information about drug effects in women. . In turn, these efforts are the result of a long history in the United States of changes in the clinical care of women, changes in the use of women as research subjects, changes in attitudes about the balance between protection and risks for women in clinical trials, and national women's movements to focus on their health care issues and transform the male-oriented model of clinical research. The new FDA guidelines, published in July 1993, will provide researchers with guidance on how to gather valuable information about how drugs work in women and will help physicians and other caregivers consider the effects of gender on health and development. treatment.",0,0,

909,HIV prevention in Mexican schools: prospective randomized evaluation of the intervention,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effects on condom use and other sexual behaviors of a school-based HIV prevention program that promotes condom use with and without emergency contraception. DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SCENARIO 40 public secondary schools in the state of Morelos, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS 10,954 high school freshmen. INTERVENTION Schools were randomly assigned to one of three arms: an HIV prevention course that promoted condom use, the same course with emergency contraception as backup, or the existing sex education course. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were completed at baseline, four months, and 16 months. Students in the intervention schools received a 30-hour course (over 15 weeks) on HIV prevention and life skills, designed in accordance with the guidelines of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. Two additional hours of emergency contraception education were provided to students in condom promotion with the contraceptive arm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was reported condom use. Other reported outcomes were sexual activity""; knowledge and attitudes about HIV and emergency contraception""; and attitudes and confidence about condom use. RESULTS The intervention did not affect reported condom use. Knowledge of HIV improved in both intervention arms and knowledge of emergency contraception improved in the condom promotion arm with contraception. Reported sexual behavior was similar in the intervention arms and the control group. CONCLUSION A rigorously designed, implemented, and evaluated HIV education course in public high schools did not reduce risky behavior, so such courses need to be redesigned and evaluated. The addition of emergency contraception did not decrease reported condom use or increase risky sexual behavior, but it did increase reported use of emergency contraception.",0,0,

911,Home blood pressure management and better blood pressure control: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine which of the 3 interventions was most effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, we conducted a 4-arm randomized trial with 18-month follow-up in primary care clinics at an American Affairs Medical Center. Veterans. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to usual care or 1 of 3 telephone intervention groups: (1) nurse-managed behavioral management, (2) nurse-physician-managed medication management, or (3) a combination from both. Of the 1551 eligible patients, 593 people were randomized"";"" 48% were African American. Intervention phone calls were triggered based on home BP values transmitted through telemonitoring devices. Behavior management involved the promotion of healthy behaviors. Medication management involved adjustment of medications by a study physician and nurse based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary outcome was change in BP control measured at 6-month intervals for 18 months. Both behavioral management and medication management alone showed significant improvements at 12 months: 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-24.1%) and 12.5 % (95% CI, 1.3%-23.6%), respectively, but not at 18 months. In subgroup analyses, among those with poor baseline BP control, systolic BP decreased in the combined intervention group by 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) at 12 months and 8.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months, relative to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: The overall effects of the intervention were moderate, but among people with poor BP control at baseline, the effects were larger. This study indicates the importance of identifying people who are most likely to benefit from potentially resource-intensive programs.

However, few data are available on the daily practice of hospital clinicians who work with smoking cancer patients. This study evaluates, in a comprehensive cancer center, the smoking habits of physicians, their clinical practice in offering a smoking cessation intervention to smoking patients, and the training they received in this field. METHODS: An Internet survey was sent to 285 physicians. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 75%. Of the respondents, 62%, 24%, and 14% had never smoked, had smoked, and smoked, respectively. Six percent of all responding physicians had already participated in smoking cessation training and 43% of them declared their willingness to receive training. Eighty-six percent of all responding physicians inquired about patients' smoking status, 50% routinely advised patients to quit, and 32% assessed their motivation to quit. Smoking cessation guidelines were not followed mainly due to lack of time, fear of increasing patient stress, and lack of smoking cessation training. 94% of the physicians surveyed were aware of the outpatient smoking cessation service and 65% referred at least one patient, 66% of the physicians surveyed were aware of the inpatient service and 36% of them requested at least one plant intervention.

919,How did formative research inform the development of a women's group intervention in rural Nepal?,"The failure to reduce neonatal and maternal mortality in poor countries is sometimes attributed to a lack of contextual knowledge about care practices and care-seeking behaviour. There is a lack of knowledge about how to translate formative research into effective interventions to improve maternal and newborn health. We describe the findings of the formative research and how they were used to inform the development of such an intervention in rural Nepal. The formative research was carried out in four parts. Part 1 involved familiarization with the study area and literature review, and Parts 2, 3, and 4 included community mapping, health services audit, and qualitative and quantitative studies of patient behaviors. perinatal care. Participatory approaches have been successful in reducing neonatal mortality and may be appropriate in our context. Community mapping and profiling helped describe the community context, and we found that community organizations often sought to engage the Women's Community Health Volunteer in community mobilization. He did not routinely hold monthly meetings and found them difficult to maintain without support and supervision. In health facilities, most primary care staff were at their posts, but doctors and nurses were not at referral centers. Mortality estimates reflected underreporting of deaths, and hygiene and infection control strategies had low coverage. Most women give birth at home with their mother-in-law, friends and neighbors. Care during perinatal illness was generally sought from traditional healers. Cultural themes of shyness, fear, and normality restricted women's behavior during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, and decisions about their health were generally made after communications with family and community. Formative research indicated the type of intervention that might be successful. It must be community and must not be exclusive to pregnant women. It should address negotiations within families and should tailor the information to the needs of local groups and particular stakeholders, such as mothers-in-law and traditional healers. The intervention must not only accept cultural constructions, but also be a forum in which to discuss ideas of contamination, shame and seclusion. We used these guidelines to develop a community-based women's participatory group intervention facilitated through a community action cycle. The success of our intervention may be due to its acceptability at the community level and its sensitivity to the needs and beliefs of families and communities.",0,0,

METHOD: The authors used mixed methods to analyze interviews with 75 clinicians on five continents about their training preferences after a standardized training session and the clinicians' first administration of the Cultural Formulation Interview. Content analysis identified the most and least useful educational methods by reason. Logistic and bivariate regression analysis compared clinical characteristics with method preferences. RESULTS: Clinicians most often cited case-based behavioral simulations as the ""most helpful"" training methods and videos as the ""least helpful."" Bivariate logistic regression models, first unadjusted and then pooled by country, found that each additional year of a physician's age was associated with a preference for behavioral simulants: OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1, 01-1.10"";"" p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians preferred active behavioral simulations in cultural competence training, and this effect was more pronounced among older clinicians.

921,How is the self-reported clinical management of patients with low back pain related to the attitudes and beliefs of health professionals? A survey of UK general practitioners and physiotherapists,"Guidelines for the treatment of low back pain (LBP) have existed for many years, but adherence to them by healthcare professionals (HCPs) remains suboptimal. The aim of this study was to measure the attitudes, beliefs and reported clinical behavior of UK physiotherapists (PTs) and general practitioners (GPs) about low back pain and to explore the associations between these. A cross-sectional postal survey of general practitioners (n=2000) and physical therapists (n=2000) was conducted, including the Pain Beliefs and Attitudes Scale (PABT.PT) and a vignette of a patient with nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). ) with questions about recommendations for work, activity, and bed rest. Data from 1022 respondents (442 GPs and 580 physiotherapists) who had recently treated patients with low back pain were analysed. While the majority of health professionals reported providing advice for the patient in the vignette that was broadly in line with guideline recommendations, 28% reported that they would advise this patient to stay off work. Job counseling was significantly related to PABS.PT scores with higher biomedical scores (F(1986)=77.5, p<0.0001) and lower behavioral scores (F(1981)=31.9, p<0.001 ) associated with advice not to work. We have shown that the attitudes and reported practice behavior of UK clinicians and physiotherapists for patients with NSLBP are diverse. Many health professionals believed that low back pain requires some avoidance of activities and work. The attitudes and beliefs of these health professionals were associated with their self-reported clinical behavior regarding work advice. Future studies should investigate whether approaches aimed at modifying these HCP factors can lead to better patient outcomes.",0,0,
922,How many steps/day are enough? for children and adolescents,"Worldwide, public health physical activity guidelines include a special emphasis on children (typically 6-11 years) and adolescent (typically 12-19 years) populations. Existing patterns are commonly expressed in terms of frequency, timing, and intensity of behavior. However, simple step output from accelerometers and pedometers is gaining greater credibility in research and practice as a reasonable approximation of daily volume of ambulatory physical activity. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the existing literature on objectively monitored step-defined physical activity for children and adolescents to provide researchers, professionals, and people who use accelerometers and pedometers with evidence-based translations of these public health guidelines. in terms of steps. /day. In terms of normative data (i.e., expected values), current international literature indicates that we can expect 1) among children, boys average between 12,000 and 16,000 steps/day and girls between 10,000 and 13,000 steps/day. day""; and, 2) adolescents consistently decrease steps/day until approximately 8,000-9,000 steps/day are observed in 18-year-olds. Controlled cadence studies show that MVPA continuous walking produces 3,300-3,500 steps in 30 minutes or 6,600-7,000 steps in 60 minutes in 10- to 15-year-olds Limited evidence suggests that a total daily physical activity volume of 10,000 to 14,000 steps/day is associated with 60 to 100 minutes of MVPA in preschool-age children ( approximately 4 to 6 years of age.) MVPA in elementary/primary school children appears to be achieved, on average, within a total volume of 13,000 to 15,000 steps/day in boys and 11,000 to 12,000 steps/day in girls. adolescents (both boys and girls), 10,000 to 11,700 may be associated with 60 my MVPA notes. Translations of guidelines based on time and intensity may be higher than existing normative data (eg, in adolescents) and thus will be more difficult to achieve (but not impossible or contraindicated). The recommendations are preliminary and more research is needed to confirm and expand the values of measured cadences, associated velocities, and MET values in youth; continue to accumulate normative data (expected values) for both steps/day and MVPA across all ages and populations; and conduct longitudinal and intervention studies in children and adolescents needed to inform the shape of stepwise physical activity dose-response curves associated with various health parameters.",0,0,

924,How the prevention potential of organizational scaling affects the success of the implementation of innovations: electronic medical records in hospitals,"Background Commitment escalation is the tendency for (innovation) projects to continue, even if it is clear that they will not be successful and/or will become extremely expensive. Escalation prevention potential (EPP), an organization's ability to stop or direct deployment processes that do not meet its expectations, can prevent an organization from wasting time and money on failed projects. EPP consists of a set of checks and balances embedded in management practices that safeguard management against irrational (but very human) decisions and can limit the scaling of implementation projects. We study whether the successful implementation of electronic medical records (EMR) is related to EPP and investigate the organizational factors that explain this relationship. Methods Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied, using questionnaire data from 427 physicians and 631 nurses who had experience with the implementation and use of EMR in hospitals, to study whether formal governance and organizational culture mediate the relationship between EPP and the perceived added value of EMR. Results Physicians and nurses in hospitals with more PPE report more successful implementation of EMR (in terms of perceived added value of EMR). Formal governance mediates the relationship between EPP and implementation success. We found no evidence that open or innovative culture explains the relationship between EPP and implementation success. Conclusions There is a positive relationship between the level of PPE and the perceived added value of EMRs. This relationship is explained by the formal governance mechanisms of organizations. This means that management has a set of tangible tools to positively influence the success of innovation processes. However, it also means that management must be able to critically reflect on their (previous) actions and decisions and be willing to change plans if elements of the EPP indicate that the implementation process is hampered.",0,0,

We present a controlled laboratory experiment to analyze the influence of fee-for-service incentives and capitation payments on physicians' supply of medical services. In our experiment, doctors choose quantities of medical services for patients with different health states. We find that physicians provide significantly more services under fee-for-service than under capitation. Patients are underserved under fee-for-service and underserved under capitation. However, payment incentives are not the only motivation for physicians' quantity choices, as the health benefits of patients are also of considerable importance.

RESULTS: After merging the results of the literature reviews and interviews, four problems emerged: (i) few reports on the theoretical models used in intervention studies, Dutch clinical guidelines and semi-structured interviews""; (ii) the inconsistency in the age-specific considerations for treatment of obesity in adolescents in Dutch intervention studies and clinical guidelines;"" (iii) the inconsistency in addressing the social nature of obesity in the Dutch intervention studies and guidelines and (iv) how professional responsibility should be divided is not clear in the Dutch intervention studies, guidelines and interviews semi-structured. CONCLUSIONS: The joint action of science and practice is necessary for future interventions. Future interventions should include topics relevant to the adolescent stage and pay more attention to the complex social nature of obesity. Finally, practitioners can generate more practice-based evidence by starting their own practice-based research.",0,0,

928,Improving physician and public acceptance and use of colon cancer screening recommendations,"Carrying out colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests is a multidisciplinary task, whose objective is to reduce mortality and the incidence of CRC without negatively affecting the health status of the participants. The adoption of a public health perspective implies a commitment to guarantee equity in access and the sustainability of the program over time. We review the available evidence on predictors of CRC screening uptake and the impact of interventions to improve screening adoption using conceptual frameworks that define the role of determinants of preventive behaviors and the scope and target of interventions. . The results of this review indicate that it is necessary to implement policy measures aimed at supporting the performance of screening tests, as well as organizational changes that influence the operational characteristics of preventive services, to allow the motivation of the individual to be realized eventually. To ensure coverage and equity in access and maximize the impact of the intervention, policies should be adopted to implement organized programs, ensuring that participation in screening and any follow-up evaluation is not limited by financial barriers. Participant and provider beliefs may determine response to different screening modalities. To achieve the desired health impact, active monitoring of people with screening abnormalities must be implemented, supported by the introduction of infrastructure changes and multidisciplinary teamwork, which can ensure the sustainability of effective interventions over time. Continuous monitoring, as well as the adoption of plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, represent crucial steps in the implementation of a successful program.",0,1,
929,How to implement clinical practice guidelines in iran,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine would arrive at the result through evidence-based implementation. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) as one of the evidence-based knowledge products, require appropriate interventions after being developed to be applied. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative study was to identify the application strategies of the CPGs produced in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intentional snowball sampling was performed and continued until theoretical saturation was reached. Semi-structured in-depth individual interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) were conducted with the aim of triangulation. The thematic framework approach was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were conducted with three health system policy and decision makers, four with experience in the production or adaptation of clinical practices, and five experts in evidence-based drug development and education. In addition, 11 policy makers, managers and decision makers from the health system participated in the FGD. The proposed interventions were classified into the following themes: Interventions aimed at health professionals, Financial, Organizational, Regulatory and Multifaceted. CONCLUSIONS: Along with the process of adaptation and development of CPGs, their use should also be planned"";"" otherwise, the time and money spent would be wasted. Certainly, imposing the aforementioned interventions with the ultimate goal of sustainable behavior change on health system service providers is beyond the capacity of specific groups or some academic centers. It requires the participation of all professionals under the monitoring and support of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

930,How to translate the therapeutic recommendations of the clinical practice guidelines into rules to criticize medical prescriptions? Methods and application to five guides,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on what to do in various medical situations, including therapeutic recommendations for prescription medications. An effective way to computerize these recommendations is to design critical decision support systems, that is, systems that criticize the doctor's prescription when it does not conform to the guidelines. These systems are commonly based on a list of ""if conditions then critical"" rules. However, writing these rules from the guidelines is not a trivial task. The aim of this article is to propose methods that (1) simplify the implementation of guideline therapeutic recommendations in critical systems by automatically translating structured therapeutic recommendations into a list of ""if conditions then critical"" rules, and ( 2) can generate a text label to explain to the doctor why their prescription is not recommended. METHODS: The therapeutic recommendations of five clinical practice guidelines on chronic diseases related to cardiovascular risk management were studied. We evaluated the system using a test base of over 2,000 cases. RESULTS: Algorithms are presented to automatically translate therapeutic recommendations into ""if conditions then critical"" rules. Eight generic recommendations are also proposed"";"" they are guideline-independent and can be used as default behavior to handle a variety of situations that are often implied by guidelines, such as lowering the dose of a poorly tolerated drug. Finally, we provide models and methods for generating human-readable textual criticism. The system was successfully evaluated on the test basis. CONCLUSION: We show that it is possible to criticize the prescriptions of the doctors from a structured clinical guide, and to give clear explanations. We are now planning a randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of the system on practices.",0,0,

Physicians at six US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers (n = 200, 85% response rate) were surveyed on their use of recommended practices in the California Task Force Guidelines for of Alzheimer's disease. Most providers (89% to 73%) reported routinely performing neurological exams, obtaining caregiver history, discussing the diagnosis with the patient's family, discussing durable power of attorney, and completing legally required driving reports. dementia. About two-thirds of providers said they routinely conduct cognitive screening, screen for depression, report elder abuse, and discuss care needs and decision-making issues with patients' families. Only half of all outpatient providers implemented caregiver support practices for at least half of their patients.

936,Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the US adult population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension have ideal blood pressure. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving the way patients and clinicians approach patient self-care. METHODS AND DESIGN: This article describes the protocol of a 2 x 2 nested randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects on systolic blood pressure of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement intervention for clinicians. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the physician intervention or physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinic level. Physician intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training comprised 2 web-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle modifications for hypertension. Performance data was collected for 18 months and feedback was provided to clinicians every 3 months. Patients participating in the intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to patient intervention or usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention delivered by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly telephone contacts with community health advisors. Follow-up measurements were made at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months.

Greater understanding of racial disparities in hypertension, in terms of risk factors, patient/physician behaviors, and treatment outcomes, is key to improving racial care for black patients. Recent data suggest that black patients progress more rapidly from prehypertension to hypertension, highlighting the need for early and immediate intervention. Unfortunately, adherence and persistence of antihypertensive therapy is generally poor in black patients and is compounded by the increased need for multidrug therapy in this patient population.

Interventions to promote PA in CRC survivors need to understand the most important beliefs influencing PA behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the strength of associations between CRC survivors' most common PA beliefs and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) motivational constructs, as well as PA behavior. INTERVENTION/METHODS: Colorectal cancer survivors (n = 600) residing in Alberta, Canada, completed self-report questionnaires assessing medical and demographic variables, PA beliefs, TPB constructs, and PA behavior. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer survivors identified better physical fitness (69.5%), family members (67.3%), and medical/health problems (8.8%) as behavioral, normative, and control beliefs most prevalent, respectively. All PA beliefs were significantly correlated with all TPB and PA constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity interventions for CRC survivors should target many salient beliefs, including behavioral, normative, and control beliefs.

940,Identification of perceived barriers to pain management in Iranian children: a qualitative study,"Hospitalized children often receive inadequate treatment for their pain. Pediatric nurses experience these shortcomings more than other members of the health care team. This research was an attempt in the form of a phenomenological study to reveal some of the main barriers in childhood pain management as nurses had perceived them. Sixteen nurses were interviewed in the pediatric medical, surgical, and infectious wards of a hospital in Iran. Data analysis was based on the Colaizzi method that revealed three main themes in different areas, namely: organizational barriers, limitations related to the characteristics of the child, and barriers related to the nature of the disease and its treatments. The results of the study have shown organizational limitations added to the lack of authority to administer any medical intervention, inadequate equipment and services, and the lack of availability of opioids as the main factors of pain control and restriction. Additional factors that relate to the child's specifications, such as age, temperament, behavior, expression, and gender, affect pain assessment and treatment. The results revealed the barriers identified in the real context. It seems that some guidelines are needed to achieve optimal pain management.",0,0,
941,"Identification, evaluation and management of obesity in an academic primary care center","BACKGROUND: The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity among children is one of the most challenging dilemmas facing pediatricians today. As the medical community struggles to develop effective strategies to treat this epidemic, early identification of obesity by pediatric health care providers remains the crucial initial step in obesity management. OBJECTIVE: To date, there has been no direct evaluation of pediatric physicians' performance in identifying and managing obesity in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to determine obesity identification rates by pediatric residents, nurse practitioners, and faculty in a primary care academic setting and to describe the actions taken by these providers in their assessment and management of obesity. DESIGN: A retrospective review of medical records of all health supervision visits was conducted for children 3 months to 16 years of age, examined between December 1, 2001, and February 28, 2002. For children, the 120% of the 50th weight-for-height percentile was defined as obese. For children > or = 5 years of age, a body mass index > 95th percentile for age and sex was defined as obese. SETTING: A large primary care practice located in a tertiary care academic pediatric hospital, serving a predominantly urban, minority (70% African American), Medical Assistance insured (90%) population. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care providers, including pediatric residents, nurse practitioners, and medical instructors. RESULTS: Of the 2,515 visits reviewed, a total of 244 patients met the study definition of obesity, yielding an estimated obesity visit prevalence of 9.7% among health supervision visits for children 3 months to 16 years of age. old. This prevalence of visits for obesity cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of obesity in the population, given the skewed distribution of visits towards very young children. For all children who met the study definition of obesity, providers documented obesity in their assessments in only 53% of the visits reviewed (129 visits). Although most charts (69%) contained an adequate dietary history, only 15% included a description of the child's activity level or television viewing. Obesity was noted on physical examination in 39% of cases. For children for whom obesity was identified as a problem by their doctors (129 patients), 81% of the charts contained an adequate dietary history, while 27% contained a description of the child's activity level or television viewing . Obesity was noted on physical examination in 64% of cases. Most children identified as obese by their providers received some specific treatment for their obesity, including education, screening, and referral to specialists. Changes in diet were recommended for 71%, increased activity for 33%, and limitation of television viewing time for only 5%. Eighty-three percent of providers recommended close follow-up monitoring. Other recommendations included referral to a dietitian (22%), screening laboratory studies (13%), a food diary (9%), endocrine referral (5%), or referral to preventive cardiology (3%). Provider identification of obesity was affected by patient age and degree of obesity. The identification of obesity was lowest among preschool children (31%) and highest among adolescent patients (76%). Providers who evaluated older and heavier children were also more likely to obtain an activity history, note obesity on physical exam, recommend changes in activity, refer the patient to a nutritionist, obtain screening lab studies, and recommend close monitoring. Identification of obesity and other outcome variables were not significantly influenced by provider training level or patient gender. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of childhood obesity has now reached epidemic proportions, it was underrecognized and undertreated by pediatric primary care providers in our study. Providers identified obesity as a problem for only half of obese children screened for health surveillance. The lowest rates of obesity identification occurred among children younger than 5 years and those with milder degrees of obesity. Identification did not improve with additional years of pediatric training. Even for the subset of children identified as obese by their providers, assessment and treatment often did not match current recommendations. For example, more attention has been paid to the role of diet, compared to activity, in assessing obesity. Notably, only a small number of providers (5%) recommended a decrease in TV viewing for their obese patients, despite evidence linking TV viewing to pediatric obesity. This finding is concerning, because obesity is known to be a multifactorial disease that responds only to significant changes in dietary and activity behaviors. Only 13% of providers requested laboratory studies as part of their recommendations. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends obtaining a lipid profile, total cholesterol level, and screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of the evaluation for obesity. Most physicians who ordered laboratory studies included thyroid function tests, which are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics due to the very low probability of hypothyroidism as a cause of obesity. Although the extent of evaluation and management of children who were recognized as obese did not meet current guidelines, it was much better than that of patients who were not identified as obese by their providers. This demonstrates the importance of timely identification as the crucial initial step in obesity management. The results of this study are disappointing, especially as evidence mounts on the importance of early intervention to prevent the medical and psychosocial sequelae of obesity, as well as the persistence of obesity in adulthood. This study highlights the need for increased awareness and identification of obesity in the primary care setting, especially among younger children and those with mild obesity.",0,0,
942,Identification and reduction of errors with surgical simulation,"The primary determinant of a patient's safety and outcome is the skill and judgment of the surgeon. While the knowledge base and decision processing are tested during the residency, technical skills, which are at the core of the profession, are not tested. Innovative state-of-the-art simulation devices that train both surgical tasks and skills, without risk to patients, should enable error and near miss detection and analysis. Studies have validated the use of a sophisticated endoscopic sinus surgery simulator (ES3) to train residents on the basics of the procedure. Evaluations are underway as to whether integrating a comprehensive ES3 training program into the residency curriculum will have long-term effects on surgical performance and patient outcomes. Using various ENT residencies, subjects are exposed to guided training on the ES3, as well as minimally invasive trainers such as the MIST-VR. Technical errors are identified and quantified in the simulator and intraoperatively. Through a web-based database, individual performance can be compared to a national standard. An enhanced version of ES3 will be developed that will support patient-specific anatomical models. This advance will allow the study of the effects of simulated trial of patient-specific procedures (mission trial) on patient outcomes and surgical errors during the actual procedure. The information gained from these studies will help usher in the next generation of surgical simulators that are anticipated to have a significant impact on patient safety.",0,1,
943,"Identification of the barriers and facilitators for a triage, treatment and transfer clinical intervention for the management of patients with acute stroke in the emergency department: a systematic review using the theoretical domains framework (TDF)","BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend that evaluation and management of stroke patients begin early, including in emergency departments (EDs). To inform the development of an emergency room-targeted implementation intervention, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies to identify relevant barriers and facilitators for six key clinical behaviors in acute stroke care: appropriate triage, of thrombolysis, monitoring and control of temperature, blood glucose levels and swallowing difficulties and transfer of stroke patients in the emergency department. METHODS: Studies of any design, conducted in the emergency department, where barriers or facilitators were identified based on primary data for one or more of these six clinical behaviors. Major biomedical databases (CINAHL, OVID SP EMBASE, OVID SP MEDLINE) were searched using comprehensive search strategies. Barriers and facilitators were categorized using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The behavior change technique (BCT) that best aligned with the strategy that each facilitator represented was selected for each of the reported facilitators using a standard taxonomy. RESULTS: Five qualitative studies and four surveys of the 44 studies identified met the selection criteria. Most of the barriers reported fell into the TDF domains of ""environment, context, and resources"" (such as stressful working conditions or lack of resources) and ""knowledge"" (such as lack of knowledge or familiarity with guidelines). Most of the enablers fell into the domains of ""knowledge"" (such as educating clinicians about the estimated risk of bleeding after intravenous thrombolysis [tPA]) and ""skills"" (such as providing the opportunity to treat accident cases). stroke of varying complexity). The total number of assigned BCTs was 18. The most frequently assigned BCTs to reported enablers were ""focus on past success"" and ""information on health consequences."" CONCLUSIONS: The barriers and facilitators to the delivery of key evidence-based protocols in an emergency setting have been identified and interpreted within a relevant theoretical framework. Since then, this new knowledge has been used to select specific BCTs to implement evidence-based care in an emergency setting. It is recommended that the findings of future similar reviews take a similar theoretical approach. In particular, the use of existing matrices to help in the selection of relevant BCTs.",0,0,
944,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: prevailing and evolving hypotheses about its pathogenesis and implications for therapy,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and usually fatal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, resulting in irreversible distortion of lung architecture. Although the pathogenic mechanisms remain to be determined, the prevailing hypothesis holds that fibrosis is preceded and caused by a chronic inflammatory process that damages the lung and modulates pulmonary fibrogenesis, giving rise to the terminal fibrotic scar. However, there is little evidence that inflammation is prominent in the early stages of the disease and it is unclear whether inflammation is relevant to the development of the fibrotic process. The evidence suggests that inflammation does not play a fundamental role. Inflammation is not a prominent histopathologic finding, and epithelial injury in the absence of ongoing inflammation is sufficient to stimulate the development of fibrosis. Furthermore, the inflammatory response to fibrogenic lung injury is not necessarily related to the fibrotic response. Clinical measurements of inflammation do not correlate with stage or outcome, and potent anti-inflammatory therapy does not improve outcome. This review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis involves abnormal wound healing in response to multiple microscopic sites of ongoing alveolar epithelial injury and activation associated with the formation of patchy fibroblast-myofibroblast foci, which evolve to fibrosis. Progress in understanding fibrogenic mechanisms in the lung is likely to lead to more effective therapies.",0,0,

Materials and methods Quasi-experimental design with nine intervention practices and 61 control practices in the Practice Partner Research Network, a network of practices that use the same EHR (Practice Partner). The nine intervention practices were located in nine US states. The design included a 3-month baseline data collection period (October to December 2009) before intervention introduction and 15-month follow-up (January from 2010 to March 2011). The main outcome measures were the prescription of antibiotics in episodes of ARI for which antibiotics are inappropriate and the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all episodes of ARI. Results In adult patients, the prescription of antibiotics in episodes of ARI in which antibiotics are inappropriate decreased more (-0.6%) among the intervention practices than in the control practices (+4.2%) (p= 0.03). However, among adults, the CDSS intervention improved broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing, with a 16.6% decrease among intervention practices versus a 1.1% increase in control practices (p<0 .0001). A similar effect was found in the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics in pediatric patients with a 19.7% decrease among intervention practices vs. a 0.9% increase in control practices (p<0.0001) . Conclusions A CDSS integrated into an EHR had a modest effect on changing prescribing for adults where antibiotics were inappropriate, but had a substantial impact on changing overall broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing among pediatric and adult patients.",0,1,
947,Impact of a computerized clinical decision support system on reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use: a randomized controlled trial.,"Objective: Many hospitals use antimicrobial management teams (AMTs) to improve patient care. However, most work with minimal IT support. We evaluated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a computerized clinical decision support system for antimicrobial utilization management. Design: A randomized controlled trial in adult patients hospitalized between May 10 and August 3, 2004. Antimicrobial utilization was managed by an existing AMT using the system in the intervention arm and without the system in the control arm. . The system was developed to alert the AMT to potentially inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. Measurements: Outcomes assessed were hospital expenditures on antimicrobials, mortality, length of stay, and time spent managing antimicrobial use. Results: AMT intervened in 359 (16%) of 2237 patients in the intervention arm and 180 (8%) of 2270 in the control arm, while spending approximately one hour less each day in the intervention arm. Hospital charges for antimicrobials were $285,812 in the intervention arm and $370,006 in the control arm, a savings of $84,194 (23%) or $37.64 per patient. No significant differences were observed in mortality (3.26% vs. 2.95%, p = 0.55) or length of hospitalization (3.84 vs. 3.99 days, p = 0.38) . Conclusion: Use of the system facilitated antimicrobial utilization management by allowing the AMT to intervene in more patients receiving inadequate antimicrobial therapy and achieving substantial time and cost savings for the hospital. This is the first study to demonstrate in a randomized controlled trial of patients that computerized clinical decision support systems can improve existing antimicrobial stewardship programs.",0,1,

Our objective was to assess the impact of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) on adherence to empiric antibiotic prescription guidelines (antibiotic and duration) for UTIs in EDs. Methods: A multicenter prospective controlled before-and-after intervention study was conducted from March 19 to October 28, 2012. All adults diagnosed with community-acquired UTI (cystitis, pyelonephritis, or prostatitis) in three EDs were included. French. Antibiotic therapy was considered guideline compliant if the prescribed antibiotic and duration were in accordance with national guidelines. Data was collected using electronic medical records. Paired tests were used when comparing periods within each ED, and global analyzes used multivariate logistic mixed models. Results Nine hundred and twelve patients were included during the 30-week study period. The CDSS was used in 59% of cases (182/307). The CDSS intervention improved compliance with antibiotic prescriptions in only one ED in a bivariate analysis (absolute increase +20%, P = 0.007). Antibiotic choice improved on multivariate analyses, but only when CDSS was used [OR?=?1.94 (95% CI 1.13 to 3.32)]. The CDSS also changed the initial diagnosis in 23% of cases, in the three EDs.

Methods We recruited 68 primary care internal and family medicine consultations; 66 were randomly assigned to a study arm; 5 consultations were withdrawn, resulting in 29 receiving the Adult Treatment Panel Third (ATP III) intervention and 32 receiving an alternative intervention focused on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee for Prevention, Screening, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) ATP III providers received a personal digital assistant that provided Framingham risk scores and ATP III recommended treatment All practices received copies of each clinical practice guideline, an introductory lecture , 1 performance feedback report and 4 visits for specific academic details of the intervention. Data in 61 practices were extracted from random samples of medical records of patients treated from June 1, 2001 through May, from May 31, 2003 (baseline) and from May 1, 2004 through April 30, 2006 (follow-up). n decisions (primary outcome) were calculated. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare results by arm, taking into account patient grouping within practices. Results We reviewed 5,057 baseline and 3,821 follow-up charts. The detection rate of lipid levels increased from 43.6% to 49.0% (ATP III practices) and from 40.1% to 50.8% (control practices) (net difference, -5.3 % [P = 0.22]). Adequate management of lipid levels decreased slightly (73.4% to 72.3%) in ATP III practices and more markedly (79.7% to 68.9%) in control practices. The net change in appropriate management favored intervention (+9.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8%-16.6% [P < .01]).

951,Impact of a multifaceted intervention on attitudes and behaviors of nurses and physicians towards family presence during resuscitation,"Recent studies of health care providers' attitudes toward the presence of patients' family members during CPR and invasive procedures (family presence) have focused on retrospective or cross-sectional surveys of staff. Research reveals that doctors' opinions about the value of this practice are mixed. Although guidelines for the implementation of family presence have been suggested, few reports have been published describing actual programs or effective strategies to change the practice. As staff members advocating for the initiation of a family presence program in our own emergency department, we were interested in assessing the attitudes of staff members before the family presence program was initiated and after it was established. We also wanted to see if attitudes differed between nurses and doctors. In this article, we report our experience with the implementation of a family presence program in the emergency department of a major academic teaching hospital.",0,1,
952,Impact of a quality improvement program on care and outcomes for children with asthma.,"Objective To test a quality improvement intervention, a learning collaboration based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series methodology, specifically aimed at improving care and outcomes for patients with childhood asthma. Design Randomized trial in primary care practices. Setting Practices in Boston, Massachusetts and Detroit, Michigan Participants Forty-three practices, with 13,878 pediatric patients with asthma, randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Intervention Participation in a collaborative learning project based on the Breakthrough Series methodology for continuous quality improvement. Main outcome measures Change from baseline in the proportion of children with persistent asthma who received appropriate pharmacological treatment for their asthma, and in the proportion of children whose parents received a written management plan for their child's asthma, as determined by telephone interviews with the parents of 631 children. Results After adjusting for status, practice size, child age, gender, and within-practice grouping, no overall effect of the intervention was found. Conclusions This methodologically rigorous evaluation of a widely used quality improvement technique did not demonstrate a significant effect on the processes or outcomes of care for children with asthma. Potential shortcomings in program implementation, project duration, sample selection, and data sources preclude the general inference that this type of breeding program is ineffective. Additional rigorous studies in more optimal settings need to be conducted to assess the efficacy of this method in improving care.",0,1,
953,Impact of a web-based antimicrobial approval system on the use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins in a university hospital.,"Objective: To achieve sustained improvement in the use of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (CEFX) in a major teaching hospital, as measured against national antibiotic guidelines. Design and setting: Pre- and post-intervention survey of CEFX use at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Melbourne, Victoria. Intervention: A web-based antimicrobial approval system linked to national antibiotic guidelines was developed by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in March 2001. Main outcome measures: Change in rate of CEFX use (defined daily doses [DDD ] per 1000 acute occupied bed days) during 8 months before and 15 months after the intervention"";"" Concordance of the indication of CEFX with the national antibiotic guidelines before and after the intervention. Results: The use of CEFX decreased from a mean of 38.3 DDD/1000 bed days before the intervention to 15.9, 18.7 and 21.2 DDD/1000 bed days at 1, 4 and 15 months after the intervention. the intervention. Agreement with national antibiotic guidelines increased from 25% of preintervention courses to 51% within 5 months postintervention (P < 0.002). Gentamicin use also increased, from a mean of 30.0 to 48.3 DDD/1000 bed days (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The web-based antimicrobial approval system achieved a sustained reduction in CEFX use over 15 months, as well as better prescription consistency with antibiotic guidelines. It has potential for linking with electronic prescribing and for wider use of other medicines, as well as for research into the epidemiology of antibiotic use.",0,1,
954,Impact of an educational intervention to improve prescribing by private doctors in Uganda,"INTRODUCTION: Private physicians in urban Uganda treat a large percentage of common adult illnesses. Improving their prescribing would not only encourage more rational drug use, but also lower costs for patients. Interventions to improve drug use tend to be more successful when face-to-face educational methods are included. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a face-to-face educational intervention on the treatment of acute respiratory infections (ARI), malaria, and non-dysenteric diarrhea by private practitioners in three urban areas of Uganda. METHODS: The study used a comparison group intervention design to assess the impact of the educational intervention. A total of 108 private physicians were divided into intervention (n = 30) and control (n = 78) groups. Surrogate patients, trained to simulate the symptoms and signs of the target conditions, were used to collect data on physicians' medical practices and prescribing behaviors. Intervention physicians were invited to a one-day interactive educational seminar facilitated by local opinion leaders that covered the principles of rational drug use and the National Standard Treatment Guidelines for treating the target conditions. Physicians also received data on referral practices. RESULTS: Baseline data indicated high rates of inappropriate treatment practices in both the intervention and control groups. There was near-universal use of antibiotics for ARIs (over 90%), high rates of recommended injections for malaria (over 30%), and high rates of polypharmacy (over three drugs per patient). After the intervention, some significant improvements in key practices were observed in the intervention group. Compared with control physicians, antibiotic prescribing for ARIs decreased by 23% in the intervention group, use of malaria combination products decreased by 28%, there were trends toward better adherence to guidelines for ARIs and malaria, and marginal reductions in drug costs. However, the overall impacts of the intervention were limited, especially on quality indicators related to medical history, proper examination, and patient counseling. CONCLUSION: The face-to-face educational intervention resulted in some small improvements in key prescribing practices of private physicians. However, an intervention involving repeated contacts with prescribers and addressing economic considerations would be necessary to obtain further improvements. Private physicians should be made aware of and encouraged to use the National Standard Treatment Guidelines, and attempts to improve their prescribing should be supported by community education.",0,0,
955,Impact of clinical practice guidelines on physician behavior: tonsillectomy in children,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the extent to which the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines to include children for tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) influenced the behavior of participating ENT surgeons. METHOD: A before-and-after study in which the intervention (the development and dissemination of local practice guidelines) was introduced sequentially in different hospitals and surgical practices. The study was carried out in four ear, nose and throat surgical services in the north of England, with 16 consultant ear, nose and throat surgeons and their junior staff on 1190 children aged 0 to 14 years who were assessed, before consulting a ENT surgeon, for have been referred for throat-related problems for which tonsillectomy was a possible treatment option were included in the study. Decision reached by surgeons and proportion of decisions that complied with the new guidelines. RESULTS: Of clinical decisions to list children for tonsillectomy made before the introduction of locally agreed guidelines, 73% (486/660) met the criteria of the later guidelines, 15% (97/660) did not. did and 12% (77/660), it was impossible to judge. After the intervention, the corresponding figures were 73% (386/530), 14% (73/53), and 13% (71/530), respectively. When decisions were made to violate guidelines, this was more often for tonsillectomy when not indicated (83% (141/170)) than withholding tonsillectomy when indicated (17% (29/170). . of the guidelines that were not followed in the decisions to perform tonsillectomy were: the child's age was younger than that recommended by the guidelines--54% (75/141)""; had presented febrile attacks of tonsillitis than those recommended by the guidelines -- 22% (32/141);"" and there were ""significant"" symptoms not included in the guidelines: 20% (29/141). CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong evidence to the contrary, local guidelines were formulated at a level that most surgeons have already reached Guideline development and implementation, therefore, had very little impact on clinical practice The local guideline development process was not sufficient to achieve the shift to evidence-based practice the evidence"";"" the clinical preference turned out to be bas so intractable. There is a need to improve clinicians' ability to assess and interpret research evidence. Previous work has emphasized the need to explore the factors that influence clinical behavior towards evidence-based practice. Our study suggests the need for more research into why clinicians continue to follow clinical preferences, even when invited to base agreed local clinical policies on evidence.",0,0,
956,"Impact of Clinical Trial Results on National Trends in ÃŽÂ± Blocker Prescription, 1996-2002","Context Research on the factors influencing prescribing patterns and the extent of change produced by clinical trial findings is limited. Objective To examine changes in the prescription of alpha-blockers for the treatment of hypertension before and after the April 2000 publication of the unfavorable early termination of the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering to prevent heart attack (ALLHAT) trial involving the study doxazosin mesylate. Prescribing changes were considered in the context of other potential concurrent influences on drug use between 1996 and 2002, including changes in alpha-blocker drug prices, generic conversion, drug promotion, and competition. Design, Setting, and Patients Using 2 national pharmaceutical market research reports published by IMS HEALTH, a-blocker prescription orders reported in the National Prescribing Audit: a random computerized sample of approximately 20,000 of 29,000 retail, independent, and drug pharmacies. mail order and aa-blocker prescribing patterns of physicians in practices reported in the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, a stratified random sample of about 3,500 physician practices, were tracked. Outcome measures Trends in physician-reported use of alpha-blockers and in prescribing and dispensing of alpha-blockers by US pharmacies Outcomes There were consistent increases in new alpha-blocker prescriptions, prescriptions dispensed, and medical drug use from 1996 to 1999. There was a modest reversal in these trends after the early termination of ALLHAT and subsequent releases in early 2000. Between 1999 and 2002, new blocker prescription orders decreased by 26% (from 5.15 million to 3.79 million), prescriptions dispensed by 22% (from 17.2 million to 13.4 million), and physician-reported drug use by 54% (from 2.26 million to 1.03 million). Other potential influences do not appear to have contributed significantly to this decline, although the cessation of alpha-blocker marketing may have accelerated the decline. Conclusions Modest but statistically significant decreases in the use of doxazosin and other alpha-blockers coincided with early termination of the ALLHAT doxazosin group. Although clinicians have responded to this new evidence, strategies to increase the impact of clinical trials in clinical practice are warranted.",0,0,
957,Impact of computerized decision support on blood pressure management and control: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of computerized decision support (CDS) designed to improve hypertension care and outcomes in a racially diverse sample of primary care patients. METHODS We randomized 2027 adult patients receiving hypertension care at 14 primary care practices to 18 months after their physicians received CDS for each hypertensive patient or to usual care without computerized support for the control group. We assessed guideline-recommended pharmacological treatment prescription and blood pressure control levels for patients in each group and examined whether intervention effects differed by patient race/ethnicity using interaction terms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blood pressure control rates were 42% at baseline and 46% at the evaluation visit with no significant difference between groups. After adjustment for patient demographics and clinical characteristics, number of previous visits, and levels of baseline blood pressure control, there were no differences between intervention groups in the odds of outcome blood pressure control. Use of CDS for providers significantly improved prescription of medications adherent to Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines compared with usual care (7% vs. 5%, P < ? 0.001); OR] 1.39 [CI, 1.13-1.72]) and the effects of the intervention did not differ by race and ethnicity of the patients. CONCLUSIONS CDS improved appropriate medication prescription without improving disparities in care and overall blood pressure control. Future Focused work is needed on improving these interventions and exploring other practical interventions to reduce disparities in outcomes related to hypertension.",1,1,
958,Impact of decision support in electronic medical records on lipid management in primary care.,"Electronic decision support tools can help improve the management of hyperlipidemia and other chronic diseases. This study examined the impact of lipid management tools integrated into an electronic medical record (EMR) in primary care practices. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of physicians using an outpatient EMR. Adult primary care physicians were randomly assigned by practice to receive an electronic form embedded in the EMR. The form contained indications about suboptimal care according to the Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) guidelines, as well as reporting tools to identify patients outside of office visits whose lipid management was suboptimal. All active patients, ages 20 to 79, whose physicians participated in the study were classified as having high, moderate, or low cardiovascular risk, and the proportion who underwent testing for hyperlipidemia, at target lipids, and at lipid-lowering medications if not at goal were measured according to ATP-III guidelines. A total of 105 physicians from 25 practices and 64,150 patients were included in the study. Results improved for most measures from before to 1 year after the intervention (November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006). However, after controlling for confounding and clustering in the multilevel model, only the updated lipid tests for high-risk patients were statistically better in the intervention group compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 15, 0, P?<?0.05). This study showed little difference in the quality of lipid management after implementing an EMR-based disease management intervention in primary care settings. Future studies may need to examine more comprehensive interventions that include clinic staff in a team approach to care. (Population Health Management 2009"";""12:221–226)",1,1,
959,Impact of EHR-based clinical decision support on guideline adherence for patients taking NSAIDs: a randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Electronic health records (EHRs) with clinical decision support show promise for improving quality of care, but their impact in managing chronic conditions has been mixed. This study examined the impact of EHR-based clinical decision support on guideline adherence to reduce gastrointestinal complications in primary care patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of primary care practices using an EHR and focused on patients taking traditional NSAIDs who had factors associated with a high risk of gastrointestinal complications (history of peptic ulcer disease) concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet medications [including aspirin], or corticosteroids, or age 75 years or older.) Practices were randomized to receive EHR-based guidelines and alerts for high-risk patients taking NSAIDs or usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received guideline-concordant care during the 1-year study period (June 2007 to June 2008), defined as traditional NSAID discontinuation (including switching to a lower-risk medication). ), the co-prescription of a gastroprotective medication, or both. RESULTS: Participants included 27 practices with 119 physicians and 5,234 high-risk patients. Intervention patients were more likely than usual care patients. to receive guideline-concordant care (25.4% vs. 22.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.42). For individual high-risk groups, patients taking low-dose aspirin were more likely to receive guideline-consistent care with the intervention than usual care (25.0% vs. 20.8%, odds ratio adjusted = 1.30, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.62). ), but there was no significant difference for patients in other high-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed only a small impact of EHR-based clinical decision support for high-risk patients taking NSAIDs in primary care practices. These results add to the growing literature on the complexity of EHR-based clinical decision support to improve quality of care.",0,0,
960,Impact of environmental olfactory cues on hand hygiene behavior in a simulated hospital setting: a randomized study.,"This study investigated the impact of a fresh scent on the rate of hand hygiene compliance (HHC) among novice healthcare providers. In total, 165 participants examined a standardized patient with one sample exposed to a fresh scent (N = 79) and the other exposed to the standard environment (N = 86). Hand hygiene behaviors were tracked prior to patient contact using video surveillance. The standard environment group had a HHC rate of 51%, while participants in the fresh scent group had a higher HHC rate of 80% (P < 0.001). These data demonstrate that hand hygiene behavior can be unconsciously influenced by cues in the environment.",1,1,
961,Impact of patient environmental education in preventive medicine practices,"BACKGROUND: Studies show that provider-oriented reminders alone are less effective in increasing physician compliance with prevention guidelines than combinations of patient-oriented and provider-oriented physician reminders. The efficacy of patient environmental education (ie, videos, brochures, and office posters) without individual staff or educator involvement has not been well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of patient environmental education in increasing the amount of preventive services that patients receive. METHODS: A nonrandomized controlled trial using historical controls was conducted in a model family medicine clinic at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque. The study group (n = 389) included adult women who had been seen at the clinic at a time when educational materials were available in the waiting room. The control group (n = 381) were equally selected patients seen during the same period of the previous year, when such materials were not available. During the intervention, patients in the waiting room were exposed to educational materials that encouraged them to ask their doctors about cholesterol tests, Papanicolaou (Pap) tests, tetanus boosters, and mammograms. For both the control and study groups, physician orders for preventive services were monitored over a 4-month follow-up period by review of medical records. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in the number of cholesterol tests, Pap tests, tetanus boosters, or mammograms ordered after the patient environmental education intervention, despite adequate statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: Patient environmental education materials were not effective in increasing the amount of preventive services performed by physicians in this study. Although such interventions are inexpensive, easy to understand, and well-intentioned, they may be ineffective in increasing the performance of preventive services for patients.",0,0,
962,Impact of feedback and didactic sessions on the reporting behavior of superior endoscopic findings by doctors and nurses,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Guidelines have been developed to report measurements of Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia and reflux esophagitis grades to improve consistency, communication, and ultimately patient care. Our goals were to assess the percentage of cases in which findings were reported in accordance with guidelines and to assess the impact of education and feedback on reporting behaviour. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study design was used. Chart reviews of all adult patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy at a tertiary care center were performed during three 2-month periods over a 12-month interval: Time 1 (March 1, 2004-April 30, 2004), Time 2 (July 1, 2004) 2004-August 31, 2004) and Time 3 (March 1, 2005-April 30, 2005). Standardized educational sessions began 2 years before Time 1. No intervention was performed between Time 1 and Time 2"";"" data were collected to examine secular change. Between Moment 2 and Moment 3, individual and group feedback and feedback sessions were provided. RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred nine eligible esophagogastroduodenoscopies were performed, of which 2675 demonstrated Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernia and/or reflux esophagitis. At baseline, Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia measurements were correctly dictated in a median of 67% and 86% of cases, respectively, improving to 100% (P < 0.05) and 98% (P < 0.01) of the cases, respectively. The Los Angeles classification system was used in a median of 100% of cases at baseline and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anonymous individual and group feedback, in combination with brief and structured didactic educational sessions, significantly improves adherence to established guidelines for reporting Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia. Once successfully incorporated into clinical practice, adherence to the Los Angeles Esophagitis Classification System is easy to maintain.",0,1,
963,Impact of information brochures on the behavior of patients with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis: a cluster randomized trial in French primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of four patient information brochures on the behavior of patients in primary care. DESIGN: Multicenter cluster-randomized controlled trial between November 2009 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS: French adults and children who consulted a participating primary care physician and were diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis. Patients were randomized to receive patient information leaflets or not, according to their primary care physician's cluster randomization. INTERVENTION: Adult patients or adults accompanying a child diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis were informed of the study. Physicians in the intervention group gave patients an information leaflet about their condition. Two weeks after the consultation, the patients (or the accompanying adult) answered a telephone questionnaire about their behavior and knowledge about the condition. MAIN MEASURES: Primary and secondary outcomes, mean behavior and knowledge scores, respectively, were calculated from responses to this questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-four physicians enrolled 400 patients. Twelve patients were lost to follow-up (3%). In the group receiving the patient information booklet, patient behavior was closer to guideline recommendations than in the control group (mean behavior score 4.9 vs. 4.2, p < 0.01 ). Knowledge was better for adults who received the booklet than in the control group (mean knowledge score 4.2 vs. 3.6, p < 0.01). There were fewer visits for the same symptoms by household members of patients who received brochures (23.4% vs. 56.2%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The patient information brochures given by the doctor during the consultation significantly modify the patient's behavior and knowledge of the disease, compared to patients who do not receive the brochures, for the conditions studied.",0,0,
964,Impact of the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria on the prescription of antibiotics: analysis of observational and randomized studies in public and private health settings,"Objectives: To examine the impact of the use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria on the prescription of antimicrobials, specifically antibiotics, for acute febrile illnesses in Africa and Asia. randomized trials and an observational study). Setting: Public and private health settings, 2007-13, in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda. Participants: 522: 480 children and adults with acute febrile illness. Interventions Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria. Main outcome measures Proportions of patients prescribed an antibiotic in trial groups who had undergone rapid diagnostic tests compared to controls and in patients with negative test results compared to patients with negative test results. positives. A secondary objective compared the classes of antibiotics prescribed in different settings. ‚¬â€°714/283Ã¢â‚¬â€°683 (59%) patients in intervention groups. Antibiotics were prescribed for 40% (35Ã¢â‚¬â€°505/89Ã¢â‚¬â€°719) of malaria-positive patients and 69% (39Ã¢â‚¬â€°400 / 57Ã¢â‚¬â€°080) of those with a negative result. All but one study showed a trend towards higher antibiotic prescriptions in the groups that underwent rapid diagnostic tests. Random-effects meta-analysis of trials showed that the overall risk of antibiotic prescription was 21% higher (95% confidence interval 7% to 36%) in intervention settings. In most intervention settings, patients with negative test results received more antibiotic prescriptions than patients with positive results for all the most commonly used classes: penicillins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one exception), tetracyclines, and metronidazole . Conclusions Introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria to reduce the unnecessary use of antimalarials, a beneficial outcome for public health, could drive the untargeted use of antibiotics. That 69% of patients were prescribed antibiotics when their test results were negative likely represents overprescription. This included antibiotics of various classes, including those such as metronidazole, which are rarely appropriate for febrile illnesses, in various clinical, health system, and epidemiological settings. It is often assumed that better disease-specific diagnosis will reduce antimicrobial overuse, but you may simply be switched from one antimicrobial class to another. The current global implementation of malaria testing could increase the non-specific use of antibiotics and should be examined.",0,1,

DESIGN: Controlled comparison study of an intervention group receiving intensive group education on the Mediterranean diet and a control group of hypercholesterolemic people receiving usual general practitioner (GP) care. SETTING: A socioeconomically deprived area in the Netherlands with a high mortality rate from coronary heart disease (CHD). SUBJECTS: Two hundred and sixty-six hypercholesterolemic people with at least two other CVD risk factors. RESULTS: After 52 weeks, the intervention group decreased total and saturated fat intake more than the control group (net differences were 1.8% (95%CI 0.2-3.4) and 1. 1 in% (95%CI 0.4-1.9), respectively). According to the Mediterranean diet guidelines, the intake of fish, fruit, poultry and bread increased in the intervention group, more than in the control group. Within the intervention group, intake of fish (+100%), poultry (+28%), and bread (+6%) increased significantly after 1 year (P < 0.05). The intensive dietary education program did not significantly reduce serum cholesterol level more (-3%) than the published brochure (-2%) (net difference 0.06 mmol l-1, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.22). Initially, body mass index (BMI) decreased more in the intervention group, but after 1 year, the intervention and control groups gained weight equally (+1%).

966,Impact of non-interruptible medication laboratory monitoring alerts in ambulatory care.,"Objective: Interrupt alerts within electronic applications can cause ""alert fatigue"" if they are triggered too frequently or are clinically reasonable only a few times. We evaluate the impact of drug lab alerts in real time and without interruptions in the supplier's order of laboratory tests. Design: We enrolled 22 outpatient clinics in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Clinics used the existing system or received on-screen recommendations for reference lab tests when prescribing new medications. Since the warnings did not interrupt, providers did not have to act or acknowledge the notification to complete a drug request. Measurements: Data was collected each time providers performed suggested lab tests within 14 days of a new prescription order. Findings were adjusted for patient and provider characteristics, as well as patient grouping within clinics. Results: Among 12 clinics with 191 providers in the control group and 10 clinics with 175 providers in the intervention group, there were a total of 3673 events in which initial laboratory tests would have been recommended: 1988 events in the control group and 1685 in the intervention group. In the control group, reference laboratories were requested for 771 (39%) of the drugs. In the intervention group, reference laboratories were ordered by physicians in 689 (41%) cases. Overall, there was no significant association between the intervention and the rate of requesting appropriate reference laboratory tests. Conclusion: We found that non-interruptible drug laboratory monitoring alerts were not effective in improving receipt of recommended drug reference laboratory test monitoring. Further work is needed to optimize compliance with non-critical recommendations.",1,1,
967,Impact of the dual intervention of pharmacists and doctors on the benzodiazepines prescribed in patients deprived of liberty: a retrospective study,"High doses of benzodiazepines (BDZ) represent an important risk factor for dependence, particularly in a prison setting. In Lyon prison, BDZ and/or opioid maintenance treatment are often prescribed to patients with mental disorders. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of the collaboration of psychiatrists and pharmacists in reducing the dose of BDZ prescribed to patients deprived of liberty. Since 2001, doctors and pharmacists have held monthly meetings to develop prescribing guidelines and discuss patients receiving high doses of BDZ. All prescribed psychotropic drugs were noted for each patient included in the control (before guidelines) and intervention groups. The criteria used to define the profile of each patient included age, diagnosis (mental disorder), and concomitant treatment (opioids, antidepressants). To compare each group, the daily dose of BDZ prescribed and expressed in diazepam equivalent was used as a quantitative variable. A total of 473 patients were included, 222 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. The two groups did not show differences in terms of diagnosis. The daily dose of BDZ was higher in the control group when all patients were considered (mean (CONTROL GROUP) = 46 mg diazepam equivalent vs. mean (INTERVENTION GROUP) = 34 mg) and for each of the the following categories of patients: (48 mg vs. 30 mg), 'no opioid therapy' (44 mg vs. 31 mg), 'buprenorphine therapy' (58 mg vs. 63 mg), 'no antidepressant therapy' (41 mg vs. 29 mg) and ""antidepressant treatment"" (53 mg vs. 38 mg). The results of this retrospective study show the positive impact of multidisciplinary intervention in reducing the prescribed daily dose of BDZ. This experience confirms the positive impact of pharmacist feedback on prescriptions and the development of treatment guidelines by physician-pharmacist collaboration to improve prescribing practice in a prison setting.",0,0,
968,Impact of medical education about asthma care on patient outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of a continuing medical education program, Asthma Care Education for Physicians, in improving pediatricians' asthma communication and therapeutic skills and patients' asthma care utilization. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in 10 regions of the United States. Primary care providers were recruited and randomly assigned by site to receive the program provided by local faculty. The program included 2 interactive seminar sessions (2.5 hours each) that reviewed national asthma guidelines, communication skills, and key educational messages. The format included short lectures, case discussions, and video modeling communication techniques. We collected information on parents' perceptions of physician communication, child asthma symptoms, and patients' asthma health care utilization. We used multivariate regression models to determine the differences between the control and intervention groups. RESULTS: A total of 101 primary care providers and a random sample of 870 of their asthma patients participated. After 1 year, we completed follow-up telephone interviews with the parents of 731 of the 870 patients. Compared with control subjects, parents reported that physicians in the intervention group were more likely to ask about patients' concerns about asthma, encourage them to be physically active, and set goals for successful treatment. Physician patients who attended the program had a greater decrease in days limited by asthma symptoms (8.5 vs. 15.6 days), as well as a decrease in emergency room visits for asthma (0.30 vs. 0. 55 visits per year). CONCLUSIONS: The Asthma Care Physician Education program was used in a variety of settings and was effective in improving parent-reported communication skills between providers, number of days affected by asthma symptoms, and use of medications. medical care for asthma. Patients with more frequent asthma symptoms and higher healthcare utilization at baseline were more likely to benefit from their doctor's participation in the program.",0,0,
969,Impact of regular collaboration between infectious disease and critical care physicians on antimicrobial utilization and patient outcome,"OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been shown to help reduce the use of unnecessary antimicrobial agents in the hospital setting. To date, there has been very little data focused on high-use areas, such as the medical ICU. A prospective intervention was conducted to assess guideline adherence, antimicrobial spending, and health care cost when an infectious disease fellow regularly interacts with the ICU medical team. DESIGN: A 3-month retrospective chart review was followed by a 3-month prospective intervention the following year. Two hundred and forty-six charts in total were reviewed for adherence to generally accepted guidelines, demographics, and microbiological results. SETTING: Twenty-four-bed medical ICU in an 861-bed tertiary care university teaching hospital in North Carolina. SUBJECTS: Patients receiving antibiotics in the medical ICU. INTERVENTION: During the intervention period, the infectious disease fellow reviewed charts, including physician notes and microbiology data, and discussed antimicrobial use with the ICU medical team. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Antimicrobial use, duration of treatment, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment II scores, length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates were compared during the two periods. . RESULTS: No statistically significant baseline differences were observed in the two groups (ie, age, gender, race, or Acute Physiology and Chronic Care Assessment II scores). Antibiotic indications included healthcare-associated (53%) and community-acquired (17%) pneumonias. Significant reductions in extended-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0080), carbapenems (p=0.0013), vancomycin (p=0.0040), and metronidazole (p=0.0004) were observed after intervention. Antimicrobial modification led to an increase in narrow-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0322). The intervention group had a significantly lower rate of non-guideline treatments (p<0.0001). There was a reduction in days of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0053), length of stay (p=0.0188), and hospital mortality (p=0.0367). The calculated annual health care savings was $89,944 from early antibiotic cessation alone. CONCLUSION: Active communication with an infectious disease professional can significantly reduce antibiotic overuse in the medical ICU by modifying or stopping antibiotics early without increasing mortality. This, in turn, can lower health care costs, foster prodigious education, and strengthen relationships between subspecialties.",0,0,
970,Impact of the WHO depression guideline on patient care by psychiatrists: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Reviews of the scientific literature aim to summarize the state of knowledge and published empirical evidence. Rather, medical guidelines are intervention tools that aim to improve physician behavior and patient outcome. They can have positive effects, but they can also have negative effects. Its effects need to be proven by research. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 103 psychiatrists in private practice were given the WHO depression guideline alone (information group), or were given the WHO depression guideline and trained for one day. in this guideline (intervention group), or left unreported. (control group). They then treated a total of 497 patients according to individual clinical considerations and patient needs. Observation of routine treatment lasted 12 weeks. Physicians and patients documented the course of illness and treatment, including physician-patient interaction. RESULTS: Psychiatrists in the intervention group saw more psychosocial stressors in their patients, prescribed higher doses of medication, had fewer dropouts, and rated treatment outcome as better. Ratings of doctor-patient interactions indicated more strain on their relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The results show both positive and negative effects of guideline exposure, but only in the training group and not in the information group. Guidelines must be empirically tested before they can be called ""evidence-based."" Each guideline should also explain how it can or should be implemented to be effective.",0,0,

972,"Implementation and adoption of electronic health records nationwide in secondary care in England: final qualitative results of a prospective national evaluation in ""early adopter"" hospitals.","OBJECTIVES To assess the implementation and uptake of the NHS Detailed Care Records service in 'early adopter' hospitals in England. DESIGN Theoretical grounded longitudinal qualitative evaluation based on case studies. SETTING 12 'early adopter' NHS acute care hospitals and specialist care settings studied over two and a half years. DATA SOURCES Data was collected through in-depth interviews, observations, and relevant documents directly related to the case study sites and to broader national developments that were perceived as impacting the implementation strategy. Data was analyzed thematically, initially within cases and then across cases. The dataset consisted of 431 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including hospital staff, developers, and government stakeholders; 590 hours of strategic meeting observations and use of the software in context; 334 sets of observation notes, investigator field notes, and national conference notes; 809 NHS documents; and 58 regional and national documents. RESULTS Implementation has proceeded more slowly, with more limited scope, and substantially less clinical functionality than originally planned. The national strategy had considerable local consequences (summarized in five key themes), and broader national developments strongly impacted implementation and adoption. More specifically, delays related to unrealistic expectations about systems capabilities; the time required to build, configure, and customize the software; the work required to ensure that systems support the provision of care; and the needs of end users for training and support. Other factors hampering progress included the changing policy environment and NHS priorities; repeatedly renegotiated national contracts; different stages of development of various NHS care record service systems;"" and a complex communication process between different stakeholders, coupled with contractual arrangements that largely excluded NHS providers. There was early evidence that implementation of systems resulted in significant learning within and between organizations and the development of relevant competencies within NHS hospitals.CONCLUSIONSImplementation of the NHS Care Records Service in 'early adopter' sites proved to be time-consuming and difficult to implement. a challenge, with still limited perceivable benefits for clinicians and no clear advantages for patients.Although our results might not be directly transferable to subsequent site adoption since the functionalities we tested were new and untested in the English context, shed light on the processes involved in the implementation n of major new systems. The move towards more local decision-making that we advocate based on our interim analysis and welcomed by the NHS has been followed, but it is important that policymakers do not lose sight of the overall goal of an integrated interoperable solution.",0,0,
973,Implementation and success of telephonic nursing counseling in linguistically isolated Korean-American patients with high blood pressure,"OBJECTIVE: Telephone nurse counseling may improve the management of chronic conditions, but the effectiveness of this approach in underserved populations is unclear. This study evaluated the use of bilingual telephone counseling provided by nurses in Korean-Americans (KA) who participated in a community-based intervention trial to improve hypertension management. METHODS: KAs were randomized to receive 12 months of hypertension-related telephone counseling that was either more intensive (every two weeks) or less intensive (monthly). Counseling records were maintained for 360 KAs who completed pre- and post-intervention assessments. RESULTS: The overall success rate of the intervention was 80.3%. The level of success was significantly influenced by counseling dose, employment status, and years of residence in the US. During the 12-month counseling period, both groups showed improvement with regard to medication intake, alcohol consumption and exercise, but did not smoke, with no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Bilingual telephone counseling could reach monolingual KAs and improve their behavior in managing hypertension. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Bilingual telephonic nurse counseling may have wide applicability, serving as an effective means of disseminating evidence-based chronic disease management guidelines to a linguistically isolated community with limited resources and health information.",0,0,
974,Fidelity trajectories of implementation of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings: stress management in rehabilitation care,"Background Although the importance of assessing implementation fidelity is recognized, little is known about the heterogeneity in fidelity over time. This study aims to generate knowledge about the heterogeneity in the implementation fidelity trajectories of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and the relationship with changes in the health behavior of patients. Methods This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-based physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Fidelity scores were calculated based on annual surveys completed by the professionals involved (n?=?Â¡Ã€?70). Higher fidelity scores indicate more complete implementation of the core components of the program. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the implementation fidelity scores of 17 organizations at three different times. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to explore the organizational and professional differences between the identified trajectories. Regression analyzes were performed to determine differences in patient outcomes. Results Three trajectories were identified as follows: Â¡Â®stable high fidelityÂ¡Â¯ (n?=?9), Â¡Â®moderate and improving fidelityÂ¡Â¯ (n?=?6), and Â¡Â ®unstable fidelity ¡Â¯ (n?=?2). Stable high-fidelity organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and improving loyalty organizations. At the beginning and end of the implementation period, support from doctors and physical therapists, appreciation from professionals, and compatibility with the program were rated more positively by professionals working in stable, high-fidelity organizations compared to moderate-fidelity organizations and improving (p ?<?.05). Qualitative data showed that stable high-fidelity organizations often had an explicit vision and strategy about program implementation. Interestingly, the trajectories were not associated with patients' self-reported physical activity outcomes (fitted model ¦Ã‚?=???651.6, t(613)?=???1032, p?=?.303). Conclusions Differences in implementation fidelity trajectories at the organizational level did not result in differences in outcomes at the patient level. This suggests that an effective implementation fidelity path depends on the conditions of the local organization. More specifically, achieving stable high fidelity in implementation required stress management: realizing a vision of localized change, while safeguarding the core standardized components of the program and engaging the few clinicians throughout the process. When scaling up evidence-based health promotion programs, we propose tailoring implementation stress management to the starting position, size, and circumstances of local organizations.",0,1,
975,Implementation of a new policy results in a decrease in the frequency of pressure ulcers,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a new policy on the efficiency of pressure ulcer care. DESIGN: Series of 1-day pressure ulcer surveys before and after implementation. SETTING: A 900-bed University Medical Center in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: On survey days, 657 patients were included before implementation, 735 patients 4 months after implementation, and 755 patients 11 months after implementation. INTERVENTION: Implementation of a hospital guideline for the care of pressure ulcers combined with the introduction of memory foam mattresses on the efficacy of prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons were made before versus after implementation regarding nursing behavior and frequency of pressure ulcer patients. RESULTS: Inadequate prevention decreased from 19% to 4% after 4 months and 6% after 11 months (P < 0.001), and inadequate treatment decreased from 60% to 31% (P = 0.005). Excluding mattress use as a positive indicator of care behavior, we found no significant increase in adequate care to prevent pressure ulcers. Furthermore, in the appropriate treatment activities, we found no significant differences. Overall, we found a significant decrease in the frequency of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers from 18% to 13% (P = 0.003) after 4 months and 11% (P < 0.001) after 11 months. CONCLUSION: The number of patients with pressure ulcers in hospital can be successfully reduced. General measures such as the introduction of suitable mattresses and guidelines for prevention and treatment are promising tools in this regard.",0,1,
976,Implementation of an effective intervention for high-risk women in Mexico: protocol for a multisite randomized trial with a parallel study of organizational factors,"Background Implementation studies of effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention interventions are rare, especially in resource-poor settings, but important because they have the potential to increase the impact of interventions by improving uptake and sustainability. . Few studies have focused on organizational and provider factors that may influence acceptance and fidelity to core components of the intervention. Using a hybrid design, we will study the implementation of an effective intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in 12 cities in Mexico. Our protocol will test a Â¡Â®train-the-trainerÂ¡Â¯ implementation model to transport the Mujer Segura (Mujer Sana) intervention to community-based organizations (CBOs). Methods We have partnered with the Mexican Foundation for Family Planning (Mexfam), a non-governmental organization that has community organizations throughout Mexico. At each CBO, trained ethnographers will survey CBO staff about the characteristics of their organization and about their attitudes toward their CBO and the implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBI). Then, after CBO staff recruit a sample of 80 eligible TRSXs and deliver a standard care educational intervention to 40 randomly selected women from that group, a Mexfam staff member will be trained in the Safe Woman intervention and then will train other counselors to provide Mujer Segura to the remaining 40 participating TRTS. FSW participants will receive a baseline behavioral assessment and be tested for HIV and STIs (syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia)"";"" they will be reassessed six months after the intervention to measure the possible effects of the intervention. At the same time, qualitative and quantitative data on the implementation process will be collected, including measures of counselor fidelity to the intervention model. Once data collection is complete in each CBO, the relative effectiveness of the Safe Woman intervention will be analyzed and, across CBOs, correlations between individual and organizational provider characteristics and intervention effectiveness will be examined. Discussion This cooperative, binational research study will provide critical insights into the barriers and facilitating factors associated with implementing interventions in CBOs using the Â¡Â®train the trainerÂ¡Â¯ model. Our work builds on similar scaling strategies that have been effective in the United States. This study has the potential to increase our knowledge about the generalization of such strategies across health problems, national contexts, and organizational contexts.",0,0,
977,"Implementation of clinical guidelines through an electronic medical record: use, satisfaction and evaluation of the doctor","BACKGROUND: We developed and evaluated the Emergency Department Expert Record System (EDECS) to provide real-time guidance on the care of low back pain in adults, fever in children, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids in emergency room workers. health, by incorporating clinical guidelines within an electronic medical record. OBJECTIVE: To describe the behaviors and attitudes of physicians who used EDECS. DESIGN: Pre-post questionnaires were used to assess physicians' attitudes. Intervention phase timing studies were observational, using clocks built into the software. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-two residents and interns from the emergency department, pediatrics, internal and family medicine, and patients with the aforementioned ailments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician use of EDECS, time spent using EDECS, physician satisfaction and beliefs. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of 142 eligible physicians used EDECS at least once. Five hundred and ninety-one of 789 (75%) eligible cases were completed using EDECS. Mean session time decreased from 12 min for session 1 to 5.5 min for sessions 16 and above. Physicians generally agreed that EDECS care was better than standard care, particularly with regard to documentation. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in beliefs across complaints. CONCLUSIONS: These data illuminate both the potential of computer-aided decision making and the need for context-specific approaches when trying to implement the guidelines.",0,1,
978,Implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of thromboembolism in spinal cord injury.,"Justification/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine if the publication of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) â€œPrevention of thromboembolism in spinal cord injuriesâ€ modified the management of the patient and if the adherence to the recommendations of the CPG improved after a targeted implementation strategy. Methods: Data were extracted from the charts of 1, 34, and 520 acute and chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, respectively, from 6 Veterans Affairs medical centers during 3 time periods: pre-publication (T1) , pre-implementation (T2) and post-implementation (T3) of the CPG. Specific interventions were developed to address providers' perceived barriers to adherence to the guidelines, based on findings from focus groups conducted at each site. Interventions incorporated two implementation strategies: standardized documentation templates/standing orders and social marketing/outreach visits. Results: The use of the specified duration of pharmacological prophylaxis increased from 60% to 65% to 75% of patients with acute SCI at T1, T2, and T3, respectively (P = 0.060 and 0.041 for T1 vs. T2 and T2 vs. to T3, respectively). The rates of use of the individual pharmacological prophylactic agents changed significantly throughout the study, with the use of low molecular weight heparin increasing from 7% at T1 to 42% at T3. Physical assessments of thrombosis on hospital days 1 and 30 improved between T2 and T3. The use of prophylaxis in patients with chronic injuries with new risk factors for thromboembolism increased from 16% to 31% to 34% during T1, T2, and T3 (P = 0.001 and 0.87, respectively). Conclusions: The publication of the CPG had a modest effect in practice. The use of structured implementation further increased adherence to some CPG recommendations for thromboembolism prophylaxis. Similar implementation strategies should be considered for CPG recommendations with low adherence and high potential for morbidity and mortality.",0,1,
979,Implementation of the diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis: Registry of Implementation of the diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis,"Frequently in clinical practice, some physicians refer patients with aortic stenosis for an invasive approach in the asymptomatic phase of the disease. This empirical behavior, which contrasts with the recommendations of current international clinical guidelines, is due to the perception that the prognosis of these patients is truly worse than expected. In reality, the management of asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis remains controversial and there is no clear agreement on how to reduce the excess clinical events associated with the presence of aortic stenosis, mortality and morbidity demonstrated in these patients by recent randomized clinical trials. . The predominant attention of treating physicians is often limited to assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis and the onset of symptoms, but it has been clearly demonstrated instead that the prognosis of these patients is associated with excessive growth of left ventricular mass and increased atherosclerosis. leading to coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and death. Thus, in addition to the markers of faster progression of aortic stenosis, many other clinical and echocardiographic variables must be considered, collected and used together with the prognostic clinical/echocardiographic scales recently validated by several authors in clinical practice, where the vast majority of these variables are culpably not taken into consideration. The registry on the Implementation of Diagnostics in asymptomatic patients with Aortic Stenosis is a prospective study designed with the aim of improving the diagnostic evaluation and improving the prognostic stratification of patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis.",0,0,
980,Evidence-based rehabilitation implementation for non-specific back pain and common mental health problems: a process evaluation of a national initiative.,"BACKGROUND: The nationwide implementation of guaranteed access to evidence-based rehabilitation was established in Sweden in 2009, through a Swedish government law. The primary goal of the rehabilitation guarantee was to increase the rate of return to work, reduce and prevent long-term absenteeism after diagnoses related to back pain and common mental health problems. This study aims to develop knowledge about the factors that influence the large-scale implementation of complex and extensive interventions in healthcare settings. METHODS: Three questionnaires, interviews, and documents from different data sources were used in data collection and analysis. Data were analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The following main facilitators contributed to the realization of the rehabilitation guarantee: financial incentives, establishment of the project organization, hiring, in-service training, and previous experiences of working on similar projects. The barriers were: the short-term project form of the rehabilitation guarantee, the attitudes and competence of clinicians to work towards return to work, the lack of guidelines describing treatment modalities in multimodal rehabilitation, and the lack of of well-defined criteria for the inclusion of patients. The documents revealed that the goal of returning to work became less pronounced during the implementation process. Instead, care and health were more frequently described in the documents used to disseminate information about the rehabilitation guarantee. Intermediate results found were: patients with rehabilitation needs were given more appropriate priority, better preparation for future implementation efforts, and higher overall competence in psychotherapy and teamwork, which was therefore available to different patient groups. those covered by the rehabilitation guarantee. CONCLUSIONS: To facilitate the implementation of established national policy goals in clinical practice, tools specifically aimed at changing physicians' attitudes and behaviors in relation to those goals are needed. Our results underline the importance of investing sufficient time and resources in the activities and in supporting the implementation process.",0,0,

982,Implementation of the Spanish adaptation of the European guidelines on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention guidelines is highly dependent on primary care physicians (PCPs) providing risk factor assessment, intervention, and patient education. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of knowledge and implementation of the Spanish adaptation of the European guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice (CEIPC guidelines) among primary care physicians. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of PCPs in Spain was conducted between January and June 2011. A random sample of 1,390 PCPs was obtained and stratified by region. The data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: More than half (58%) of the physicians were aware of and aware of the recommendations, and 62% of them claimed to use them in clinical practice, with general practitioners (without any specialist accreditation) being less likely to do so than general practitioners. family doctors. The majority of PCPs (60%) did not assess cardiovascular risk, citing the limited time available for surgery as the biggest barrier at 81%. The main reason to be skeptical about the recommendations, reported by 71% of doctors, was that there are too many guidelines. Nearly half of clinicians cited lack of training and skills as the biggest barrier to implementing lifestyle and behavior change recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Most PCPs were aware of the Spanish adaptation of the European CVD prevention guidelines (CEIPC guidelines) and their content. However, only a third of primary care physicians used the guidelines in clinical practice and less than half of the CVD risk assessment tools.",0,0,

Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce later CVD risk. OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts study was designed to test strategies that facilitate adoption of the Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents endorsed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and smoking using two strategies: a multifaceted practice-directed intervention versus a standard dissemination. STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for intervention and outcome assessments. Individual practices were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network affiliation, number of physicians per practice, urban versus non-urban location, and practice type. The observation units are individual children because adherence to the measure is extracted from the medical records of individual patients. Randomization units are medical practices. This results in a multi-level design in which patients are nested within practices. Intervention practices received toolkits and supported implementation of guidelines, including academic details, an ongoing e-learning group. This project is aligned with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintenance of Certification requirements, which include monthly physician self-abstraction, webinars, and other essay elements.

984,Implementation of the Tobacco Tactics intervention versus usual care in Trinity Health community hospitals,"BACKGROUND: Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) implementation framework, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health compared the nurse-managed Smoking Intervention with usual care. A previous article describes the effectiveness of tobacco intervention tactics. This later document provides data describing the remaining constructs of the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: This pragmatic study used a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design at five Michigan community hospitals, of which three received the Nurse Administered Smoking Intervention and two received usual care. Nurses and patients were surveyed before and after the intervention. Measures included outreach (patient engagement rates, characteristics, and receipt of services), adoption (nurse engagement rates, and characteristics), implementation (pre- and post-training changes in nurses' attitudes, service delivery, barriers for implementation, feedback on training). , documentation of services and number of follow-up phone calls from volunteers), and maintenance (continuation of the intervention after the study has ended). RESULTS: Scope: Patient participation rates were 71.5%. Compared with no change at control sites, there were significant pre- and post-intervention increases in self-reported receipt of printed materials at intervention hospitals (n = 1370, p < 0.001). Adoption: All targeted units and several non-targeted units participated in the intervention hospitals"";"" 76.0% (n = 1,028) of the screened nurses and 317 additional staff members participated in the training, and 92.4% were extremely or somewhat satisfied with the training. IMPLEMENTATION: Nurses in intervention hospitals reported increases in the provision of smoking cessation advice, counselling, medications, brochures, and DVDs (all p < 0.05) and reported decreases in barriers to implementing smoking cessation services ( p < 0.001). Qualitative comments were very positive ('easy to use', 'simplified' or 'time-saving'), although problems were noted when showing patients the DVD and charts in the electronic medical record. Maintenance: Nurses continued to provide the intervention after the study ended. CONCLUSIONS: Given that nurses represent the largest group of frontline providers, this intervention, which meets the Joint Commission guidelines for the treatment of hospitalized smokers, has the potential to be broad in scope and decrease smoking, morbidity and mortality among hospitalized smokers. As we move toward more population-based interventions, the RE-AIM framework is a valuable guide to implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01309217.",0,1,
985,IMPLEMENTATION of a clinical practice guideline for evidence-based management of acute low back pain in general practice (IMPLEMENT): cluster randomized controlled trial study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Evidence generated from reliable research is not often implemented in clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of guideline dissemination implementation strategies concluded that there was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies for promoting guideline uptake. Recommendations from this review and other studies have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because they may be more effective than those that are not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides the opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition that is common, has a high burden, and for which there is a gap between evidence and practice in the primary care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to implement a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our main objectives are to establish whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for plain radiography and improving the mean level of disability of patients three months after consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomized controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (groups), including at least one licensed general practitioner, will be randomized to an intervention or control arm by restricted randomisation. Patients 18 years of age or older visiting a participating physician for acute nonspecific low back pain of less than three months' duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2,300 participating patients. General practitioners in the control arm will receive access to the guideline using the existing dissemination strategy. Professionals from the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioral theory.

986,Implementation of a guideline for the treatment of type 2 diabetics: results of a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT),"BACKGROUND: In Italy, many diabetics still lack adequate care in general practice. We evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies for the implementation of an evidence-based guideline for the management of uncomplicated type 2 diabetes among general practitioners (GPs) in the Lazio region. METHODS: Three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with general practitioners as randomisation units (groups). 252 GPs were randomized to an active strategy (training module with guideline delivery) or passive dissemination (guideline delivery only) or usual care (control). Data on drug and test prescriptions were collected by existing information systems, while patient data came from GP databases. The results of the process were measured at the group level one year after the intervention. The primary results referred to the measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin and the implementation of evaluation tests for micro and macrovascular complications. In order to assess physicians' medication prescribing behaviour, secondary outcomes were also calculated. RESULTS: Physicians identified 6,395 uncomplicated type 2 patients with a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Data on the initial performance of GPs show low proportions of glycosylated hemoglobin assessments. The results of the C-RCT analysis indicate that the active implementation strategy was ineffective for all primary outcomes (respectively, OR 1.06 [95% CI: 0.76-1.46]""; OR 1.07 [ 95% CI: 0.80-1.43];"" OR 1.4 [95% CI: 0.91-2.16].

Primary care physicians (PCPs) are instrumental in recommending breast cancer screening for their patients. Academic details are a promising strategy for improving PCP performance in recommending breast cancer screening, yet little is known about the effects of academic details on breast cancer detection among physicians practicing in medically active areas. unattended. We evaluated the effectiveness of a multicomponent enhanced academic detailed intervention to increase recommendations for breast cancer screening within a sample of urban community physicians. METHODS: Two medically underserved communities were matched and randomly assigned to intervention and control arms. Ninety-four community (ie, non-hospital-based) primary care physicians in northern Manhattan were compared with 74 physicians in the South Bronx neighborhoods of the New York City metropolitan area. Intervention participants received physician-led enhanced academic details, using the American Cancer Society guidelines for early detection of breast cancer. Physicians in the control group did not receive any intervention. We conducted interviews to measure primary care physicians' self-reported recommendation for mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE), and whether PCPs taught women how to perform breast self-examination (BSE). RESULTS: Using multivariate analyses, we found a statistically significant intervention effect in recommending EBC to female patients aged 40 years and older"";"" Reports of mammography and breast self-examination increased in both arms from baseline to follow-up, based on physician self-report. At posttest, physician participation in additional educational programs, increased self-efficacy in prevention counseling, routine use of chart reminders, computer-based rather than paper-based counseling and follow-up approaches, printed education materials for the patient, performance goals for mammography, and greater involvement of nursing and other office staff were associated with greater detection. CONCLUSION: We found some evidence of improvement in breast cancer screening practices due to improved academic detail among primary care physicians practicing in underserved urban communities.",0,0,
989,Implementation of best evidence in smoking cessation treatment for hospitalized veterans: results of the VA-BEST trial,"BACKGROUND: Although the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has promoted adherence to smoking cessation guidelines since 1997, hospitalized smokers do not receive consistent cessation assistance . METHODS: In a pre- and post-guideline implementation trial in inpatient medicine units at four VA hospitals, the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention (improved academic details, modified nursing intake template, patient education and helpline referral, practice facilitation, and staff feedback). ) the behavior change of the practice was evaluated. Interviews were conducted before discharge with 824 patients to assess the reception of the 5As (ask, advise, assess, help, organize) by nurses and doctors in hospitalized smokers. RESULTS: Subjects were significantly more likely to have received each of the 5A's from a nurse during the post-implementation period (except for ""advise to quit""). More patients were helped to quit smoking (75% vs. 56%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6, 3.1) and were arranged for follow-up (23% vs 18%, adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.2) by a nurse during the post-implementation period. However, unadjusted results showed no improvement in 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up (13.5% vs. 13.9%). Nurses' self-efficacy in smoking cessation counseling, measured in a survey of 166 unit nurses, improved after implementation of the guideline. DISCUSSION: A multifaceted intervention that includes enhanced academic details is an effective strategy to improve the delivery of smoking cessation services to hospitalized medical patients. To promote long-term cessation, more intensive interventions are needed to ensure that motivated smokers receive guideline-recommended treatment (including pharmacotherapy and referral for outpatient smoking cessation advice).",0,0,
990,"Implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of diabetes mellitus in general practice. Evaluation of effort, process, and patient outcome related to the implementation of a computer-based decision support system","OBJECTIVES: To assess the implementation of clinical guidelines for diabetes mellitus in general practice with a specific clinical decision support computer system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. METHODS: Randomized study with a health center as unit. General practice in Sor- and Nord-Trondelag counties in Norway, 380,000 inhabitants. Seventeen health centers with 24 doctors and 499 patients with diabetes mellitus were in the intervention group and 12 health centers with 29 doctors and 535 patients were in the control group. The main outcome measures were group differences in fractions of patients without records (process assessment) and group mean differences for the same variables (patient outcome assessment). RESULTS: Statistically significant group differences were experienced for fractions of patients with no smoking record (intervention group, 82.6%; control group, 94.5%), body mass index (78.2% vs. 93, 0%) and sufficient records to calculate the risk score for myocardial infarction (91.1% vs. 98.3%);"" all for 18 months. Large variations in the center were shown for all variables. The only statistically significant group difference was -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -3.8, -0.8) in diastolic blood pressure in favor of the intervention group. Statistically insignificant differences in favor of the intervention group were HbA1c, -0.1% (95% CI, -0.4, 0.1), systolic blood pressure, -1.2 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.4, 2.0).

991,Implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertension in general practice.,"Discrepancies between clinical guidelines and clinical practice call for practical implementation strategies. This study evaluates the implementation of clinical guidelines for hypertension in general practice with a specific computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. We conducted a randomized study of general practice health centers in SÃ¸r- and Nord-TrÃ¸ndelag counties in Norway (population 380,000). A total of 17 health centers were included, with 24 physicians and 984 patients in the intervention group. Data from 887 patients were used in the analyses. There were 12 health centers with 29 physicians and 1,255 patients in the control group. Data from 1127 control patients were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were the behavior of the physician, measured by compliance with the registry of the variables recommended in the Norwegian clinical guidelines for hypertension. The objective of the intervention was to reduce the fractions of patients without records. However, there were no clinically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for the fractions of patients without blood pressure recording (intervention group 14.3%, control group 14.2%) or serum cholesterol (62.3% vs. 56.8%) for 12 months, nor, for 18 months, for fractions of patients with no smoking record (82.9% vs 87.1%), cardiovascular inheritance (79.5% vs 73.4%) and index body mass (81.5% vs 89.2%). One or more variables required for calculation of the risk score for myocardial infarction were missing in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group and in 91.9% of patients in the control group. Large variations in the center were shown for all variables. The implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertensive patients in general practice, by means of a CDSS and various procedures for its implementation, did not result in clinically significant changes in the behavior of physicians. Of importance are both the lack of ease of use of the specific CDSS and the problems in performing time-consuming multidimensional procedures.",0,1,

993,Implementing Evidence-Based Practice: Efficacy of a Structured Multifaceted Mentoring Program,"OBJECTIVE: This paper is a report of the effectiveness of a multifaceted structured mentoring program designed to implement evidence-based practice in an intensive clinical research setting. BACKGROUND: Barriers to implementing evidence-based practice are well documented in the literature. Evidence-based practice is associated with higher quality care and better patient outcomes than tradition-based care. However, the integration of evidence-based practice implementation into daily clinical practice remains inconsistent, and the gap between research and clinical practice remains considerable. METHODS: This quasi-experimental mixed methods study included three focused discussions with nursing leadership and shared governance staff, as well as pre- (N = 159) and post-intervention (N = 99) questionnaires administered between June 2006 and February 2007. Online questionnaires included measures of organizational readiness, evidence-based practice beliefs, evidence-based practice implementation, job satisfaction, group cohesion, and intention to leave nursing and current job. Results. Participants in the evidence-based practice mentoring program had greater increases in perceived organizational culture and evidence-based practice readiness and evidence-based practice belief scores than those who did not participate. Qualitative findings suggested that leadership support for a culture for evidence-based practice and dedication of resources to sustainability of the initiative should be a priority to engage staff at all levels. CONCLUSION: These findings corroborate other studies showing that nurses' beliefs about evidence-based practice are significantly correlated with implementation of evidence-based practice and that having a mentor leads to stronger beliefs and greater implementation by nurses. part of nurses, as well as greater group cohesion, which is a powerful predictor of nursing turnover rates.",0,0,
994,Implementation of antidepressant prescribing depression guidelines in general practice: a quasi-experimental evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Internationally, depression guidelines recommend a stepped-care approach, which implies that antidepressant medication should not be offered as first-stage treatment to patients with mild or subthreshold depression. In the Netherlands, antidepressant prescription rates in general practice as the first step of treatment are considered high. The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations of the guidelines on the prescription of antidepressants. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a non-equivalent naturalistic control group and a three-year follow-up in the general practice setting in the Netherlands. General practitioners (GPs) participated in a national Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC), focusing on the implementation of a guideline-based model for a stepped-care approach to depression. The model consisted of self-help and psychological treatment options for patients with milder symptoms as an alternative to antidepressants in general practice. Changes in GP antidepressant prescription rates were documented over a three-year period and compared with those of a control group of GPs, selected from an ongoing national registry network. RESULTS: A 23.3% (49.4%-26.1%) decrease in antidepressant prescription rates was found for newly diagnosed patients with depressive symptoms within the intervention group, while no difference was observed in the reference group (50.3%-52.6%). The decrease over time was significant, compared to the usual care group (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: An implementation program that used stepped-care principles for intervention allocation for depression resulted in reduced antidepressant prescription rates in general practice. GPs can change prescribing behavior within the context of a QIC.",0,1,
995,Implementation of guidelines for the prevention of opportunistic infections in inflammatory bowel disease,"INTRODUCTION: Opportunistic infections are a key safety issue in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the existence of international guidelines, many gastroenterologists have not adopted routine screening and vaccination. The aim of this study was to modify clinical behavior by using a simple screening tool. METHODS: Each participating gastroenterologist was provided with a screening and vaccination card for hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, pneumococcus, human papillomavirus, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV. Gastroenterologists were surveyed for vaccine recommendations and current practice before and after the introduction of the proforma. Immunity rates and the proportion of patients receiving recommended screening tests and vaccinations were documented. RESULTS: 30 gastroenterologists from 8 different IBD centers participated in the evaluation. A total of 919 patients (55% women, 65% Crohn's disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, 2% indeterminate IBD) were included. Introduction of the proforma increased self-reported gastroenterologist screening from 47% to 97% before and after the intervention, respectively, p<0.001. After applying the proforma, vaccination against hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza and pneumococcus was recommended in 67%, 2.5%, 75% and 69% of the patients, respectively. Of these, 42%, 39%, 66% and 49% of the patients followed the recommendations and were vaccinated. Cervical smears were recommended in 31%, and 62% of these obtained the recommended cervical smear. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a screening and vaccination form significantly changed the self-reported behavior of the gastroenterologist. Patient compliance with these recommendations was suboptimal and suggests the need for further patient education, in addition to other forms of support.",0,1,
996,Implementation of international osteoarthritis treatment guidelines in primary health care: study protocol for the SAMBA stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background Previous research indicates that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are not receiving optimal recommended treatment. Based on international treatment recommendations for hip and knee OA and previous research, the SAMBA model for integrated OA care in Norwegian primary health care has been developed. The model includes physical therapist (PT)-led patient OA education sessions and an exercise program that lasts 8-12 weeks. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of a customized strategy to implement the SAMBA model. Methods/design A cluster randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design including an evaluation of effects, processes and costs will be carried out in six municipalities (clusters) in Norway. The municipalities will be randomized by the time of transition from the current usual care to the implementation of the SAMBA model through a personalized strategy. The tailored strategy includes interactive workshops for general practitioners (GPs) and PTs in primary care covering the SAMBA model for integrated OA care, educational material, educational outreach visits, commentary, and reminder material. Outcomes will be measured at the patient, GP, and physiotherapist levels using self-report, semi-structured interviews, and record-based data. The primary outcome measure is patient-reported quality of care (Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator Questionnaire) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include referrals to physical therapy, imaging, and orthopedic surgeon referrals, as well as participants' satisfaction with treatment, symptoms, level of physical activity, body weight, and self-reported and measured lower extremity function. Actual exposure to custom deployment strategy and user experiences will be measured in a process assessment. In the economic evaluation, the difference in costs of usual OA care and the SAMBA model for integrated OA care will be compared to the difference in health outcomes and reported using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) . Discussion The results of the present study will add to the current knowledge on personalized strategies, which aim to improve the acceptance of evidence-based OA care recommendations and improve the quality of OA care in primary health care. The new knowledge can be used in national and international initiatives designed to improve the quality of OA care. ClinicalTrials.gov Trial Registration NCT02333656",0,1,
997,Implementation of nutritional guidelines: the effect of systematic training for nutrition nurse practitioners,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 40% of patients admitted to hospitals are malnourished. The implementation of nutritional guidelines could reduce the incidence of malnutrition and requires education and training for hospital staff. OBJECTIVE: It was hypothesized that a behaviorally focused training program for staff would increase the identification of eating difficulties, improve patients' knowledge of appropriate food choices, and increase the number of snacks eaten between meals, and therefore Therefore, it would reduce the risk of malnutrition. METHODS: A pre-post test design was used to assess the effect of the nurse training program. The training took place in five modules over 1 year and combined nutrition topics with implementation topics and theories of planned change. The program was based on experiential learning theories and the steps of look, think and act. The effect on patients was measured using a patient questionnaire. RESULTS: After implementing the guidelines, more patients discussed their eating difficulties with staff, received relevant assistance during the meal, and were served the type of food they had ordered and could chew. Patients' knowledge of appropriate menu food choices increased, suggesting that patients' nutritional intake had improved. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a strategy based on the principles of experiential learning theory and the phases in the look, think and act model facilitated the implementation of nutritional guidelines in a hospital setting.",0,0,

999,Implementation of research results in practice using clinical opinion leaders: barriers and lessons learned,"BACKGROUND: An opinion leader-driven intervention to improve practice guideline-based medication management for patients with schizophrenia was tested in four Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities. The concept of using opinion leaders as disseminators of research evidence and internal agents of change has been widely publicized. PROJECT OVERVIEW: Each intervention site received an intensive multi-component intervention over the course of one year. Evaluation of the project process included brief ongoing surveys of clinicians' attitudes and behaviors, records of opinion leader conference calls, and interviews with opinion leaders toward the end of the implementation period. BARRIERS OR PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS: Several barriers or problems emerged: (1) clinicians do not always agree on who is an opinion leader; some sites may not have a thought leader; (2) some sites had poorly developed formal and informal social development. networks between doctors; (3) a focus on clinicians only as agents of change;"" and (4) how much direction should be given to opinion leaders on how to influence attitudes and behaviors?

1000,NHS information technology program implementation: a qualitative study of progress in acute trusts,"OBJECTIVES To describe the progress and perceived challenges in implementing the NHS information and technology (IT) program in England. DESIGN Case studies and in-depth interviews, with themes identified using a framework developed from grounded theory. We interviewed staff who had been interviewed 18 months earlier or new staff in the same positions. SETTING Four NHS acute care hospital trusts in England. PARTICIPANTS Medical and Senior Trust Managers, including CEOs, IT Directors, Medical Directors and Nursing Directors. RESULTS Interviewees strongly supported the goals of the program, but had several serious concerns. As before, implementation is hampered by local funding shortfalls, delays in implementing program-compliant patient management systems, and poor communication between Connecting for Health (the agency responsible for the program) and local administrators. . New problems arose. Local administrators are unable to prioritize program implementation due to competing financial priorities and program uncertainties. They perceive an increasing risk to patient safety associated with delays and loss of integration of program components, and are unhappy with Choose and Book (electronic booking for referrals from primary care). CONCLUSIONS We recommend that the program establish realistic schedules for individual trusts and advise managers on interim IT systems they must purchase due to delays beyond their control. Advice must take into account the need for trusts to ensure long-term compatibility with the program and value for money. Trusts need assistance in prioritizing IT modernization, for example, including program implementation in the performance management framework. Even with Connecting for Health taking a different approach of setting core standards with local implementation, these issues will still need to be addressed. Lessons learned in the NHS are of greater relevance as health systems, such as in France and Australia, seek to harness the potential of large-scale IT modernisation.",0,0,
1001,Implications of stroke prevention trials: managing global risk,"Clinical trials have shown that the risk of cardiovascular events can be reduced in stroke patients by lowering blood pressure (BP) and statin therapy, regardless of the presence of specific risk factors. These results suggest an alternative approach to secondary stroke prevention, focused more on global risk than on detection and modification of individual categorical risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. A risk-based approach is warranted because stroke patients are at high risk for several cardiovascular events, not just stroke, and because physiological risk factors such as BP demonstrate a continuous or log-linear relationship with risk. cardiovascular. Essential to the implementation of such an approach is the development of suitable risk stratification models for stroke patients. However, based on the limited evidence available, it appears that most patients who experience an ischemic stroke or TIA are at high long-term absolute risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event and should be treated with all available strategies for risk reduction. of the risk.",0,0,
1002,Importance of the characteristics and modalities of physical activity and exercise in defining cardiovascular health benefits in the general population: EACPR recommendations (Part I),"In recent decades, increasing evidence has accumulated that physical activity (PA) and exercise interventions are essential components in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The disease management intervention included development of a patient registry, a systematic approach to assessing asthma control using the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ), case management, and physician education. An administrative database was used to examine hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits. A medical record audit was conducted to examine recorded adherence to asthma documentation guidelines and practices. The study reference population included 3486 adults and children with asthma. The ATAQ suggested that, at the start of the study, control problems were common, with 34% of adults surveyed missing work due to asthma. ATAQ also revealed several areas for improving care. For example, only 20% of adult respondents reported having a written treatment plan. File review and administrative complaint analysis showed that the program had beneficial results in several areas. Medical history documentation improved for asthma diagnosis (83.3% vs. 98.6%""; p < 0.001) and patient education (15.7% vs. 26.1%;"" p < 0.001 ). No improvements were seen in documentation of peak flow ownership/use, smoking cessation advice, or influenza vaccination.

1005,Improving the delivery of cardiovascular care (IDOCC) through facilitating disclosure: study protocol and implementation details of a cluster randomized controlled trial in primary care,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to find innovative approaches to translate best practices for chronic disease care into daily practical routines of primary care. Primary care plays a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, there is a substantive care gap and there are many challenges in implementing evidence-based care. The Improving the Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project is a pragmatic trial designed to improve the delivery of evidence-based care for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in primary care practices by facilitating the extension of practice. METHODS: The IDOCC project is a staggered-cluster randomized control trial in which practice extension facilitators work with primary care practices to improve prevention and management of cardiovascular disease for patients at increased risk. Primary care practices in a large health region in eastern Ontario, Canada, were eligible to participate. The intervention consists of regular monthly meetings with the scope of practice facilitator for a period of one to two years. Beginning with audit and feedback, consensus building and goal setting, the practices are supported in changing practice behavior by incorporating elements of the chronic care model. These elements include (a) evidence-based decision support for providers, (b) delivery system redesign for practices, (c) improved self-management support tools provided to practices to help them engage patients, and (d) increased community resource linkages for practices to improve patient referral. The primary outcome is a composite score measured at the patient level to represent each practice's compliance with evidence-based guidelines for cardiovascular care. A qualitative analysis of practice extension facilitators' written narratives about their ongoing practice interactions will be conducted. These textual analyzes will add more information to understand the critical factors affecting project implementation. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic, staggered, randomized controlled trial, with both quantitative and process evaluations, demonstrates innovative methods for implementing large-scale quality improvements and evidence-based approaches to care delivery. This is the first Canadian study to examine the impact of a large-scale, multifaceted cardiovascular quality improvement program in primary care. It is anticipated that through the IDOCC evaluation, we will demonstrate an effective, practical and sustainable means of improving the cardiovascular health of patients across Canada.

1006,Improved use of perioperative antibiotics and reduction of surgical wound infections through the use of computerized decision analysis.,"prospective study was conducted over a two-year period to determine whether computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use could improve prescribing habits and reduce postoperative wound infections. During the first year, baseline patterns of antibiotic use and postoperative infection rates were established. During the second year, computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use were placed in the patient's chart prior to surgery, and patterns of antibiotic use and postoperative wound infections were monitored. Hospitalized patients who underwent non-emergency surgery from June to November 1985 (3263 patients) and from June to November 1986 (3568) were monitored for indications for perioperative antibiotic use, timing of antibiotic use and postoperative infectious complications. Perioperative antibiotic use was considered advisable in 1,621 (50%) patients in the 1985 sample and 1,830 (51%) patients in the 1986 sample. Among these patients, antibiotics were administered within two hours before incision surgery in 638 (40%) of the 1985 sample and 1,070 (58%) of the 1986 sample (p<0.001). Overall, postoperative wound infections were detected in 28 (1.8%) of 1621 patients in 1985 compared to 16 (0.9%) of 1830 such patients in 1986 (p<0.03). We conclude that computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use improved prescribing habits with a concomitant decrease in postoperative wound infections.",1,1,
1007,Improved therapeutic monitoring with various interventions: a randomized trial.,"Background Medication errors are often related to failure to properly select medications or adjust laboratory parameters. Differences between guideline recommendations and the actual frequency of therapeutic laboratory monitoring are substantial. This study evaluated interventions to improve laboratory control at the start of drug therapy. Methods This cluster-randomized trial compared 3 interventions with usual care for 10 medications in 15 primary care clinics in a health maintenance organization with an electronic medical record system. Eligible patients, identified from electronic databases, had not received recommended laboratory monitoring within 5 days of re-dispensing a study drug. The interventions were an electronic medical record reminder for the prescribing health professional, an automated voice message for the patient, and a pharmacy team to communicate with the patient. The primary outcome was completion of all recommended reference laboratory controls. Results A total of 961 patients participated in the study. At 25 days, 95 (48.5%) of 196 patients in the electronic medical record reminder group, 177 (66.3%) of 267 in the automated voice message group, 214 (82.0%) of 261 in the pharmacy team outreach group and 53 (22.4%) of 237 in the usual care group had completed all recommended baseline laboratory checks (p < 0.001). After adjustments, the hazard ratios for completing laboratory monitoring compared with usual care were 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.5) for electronic medical record recall, 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-5.6) for automated voice message and 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 4.9-9.0) for team reach pharmacy. Conclusions All 3 interventions were effective in increasing laboratory monitoring when starting new medications in primary care.

A mixed model of three levels was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes, and non-parallel group-specific changes over time were tested. RESULTS: A total of 15,041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients were in the IG and 4,213 (21.9%) in the CG. At one year of follow-up, 82.9% of the patients in the IG and 81.5% in the CG remained in the study. The guideline-oriented BP goal was achieved by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P = 0.03), while the individual BP goal was reached by 57.0% in the IG and 51% in the CG (P = NS). BP control in the IG was achieved 2 months earlier on average. Clinical inertia, defined as no medication changes despite lack of BP control, occurred significantly less frequently in the IG group. Cardiovascular outcomes at one year did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Systematic information delivery in connection with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves adherence to guidelines. Although compared to previous studies, the rates of hypertension control obtained are higher, there is still considerable room for improvement.",0,0,
1010,Improvement of intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in prolonged cardiac surgery through automated alerts in the operating room,"Objective: To evaluate the impact of an automated intraoperative alert to redose prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged cardiac operations. Design: Randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded trial. Setting: Hospital attached to the University. Patients: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery lasting more than 4 hours after preoperative administration of cefazolin, unless they were receiving therapeutic antibiotics at the time of surgery. Intervention: Randomization to an audible and visual reminder on the operating room computer console at 225 minutes after administration of preoperative antibiotics (reminder group, n = 137) or control (n = 136). After another 30 minutes, the circulating nurse was asked to indicate whether a follow-up dose of antibiotics had been given. Results: Intraoperative redosing was significantly more frequent in the reminder group (93 of 137; 68%) than in the control group (55 of 136; 40%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval). %, 1.97 to 5.56, p < 0.0001) The impact of the reminder was even greater compared to the 6 months prior to the study period (129 of 480, 27%, p < 0.001), which suggests some side effect in the control group decreased for 19 of 44 patients in the reminder group without redosing The surgical site infection rate in the reminder group (5 of 137; 4%) was similar to that in the control group ( 8 of 136, 6%, P = 0.42), but significantly less than in the pre-study period (48 of 480, 10%, P = 0.02).Conclusion: The use of an automatic reminder system in the operating room improved compliance with guidelines on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.",1,1,
1011,Improving adherence to hypertension medication prescription guidelines: a cluster-randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific recommendations.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention that focuses the physician's attention on the choice of drugs for the treatment of hypertension improves concordance between drug regimens and guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with implementation of a general guideline in geographically diverse primary care clinics of a university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs health system. METHODS: Thirty-six physicians and nurse practitioners participated (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group), with findings based on 4500 hypertensive patients. Implementation of general guidance for all physicians, including education on guideline-based medication recommendations and goals for adequate blood pressure control, was compared with the addition of an individualized printed notice sent to physicians. physicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or not the patient's antihypertensive medication is available. the regimen was consistent with the guidelines. We measured the change from baseline to endpoint in the proportion of physicians' patients whose drug therapy was consistent with guidelines. RESULTS: The individualized intervention resulted in an improvement in guideline agreement that was more than double that observed for the overall intervention (10.9% vs. 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = 0.008). Bootstrap analysis showed that being in the individualized group increased the odds of agreement 1.5-fold (P = 0.025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control increased within each study group"";"" however, the difference between groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: Individualized advice on drug therapy for hypertension given to the physician at each patient visit was more effective in changing the physician's prescribing behavior than implementation of general guidance.",0,1,

The underuse of generic drugs is an important example. Methods: A literature review was conducted to answer 5 questions about generic drugs: 1) How often are brand name drugs used when a generic version is available? 2) How does the use of generic drugs influence adherence? 3) What is the evidence that brand and generic drugs have similar clinical effects? 4) What are the barriers to increasing the use of generic drugs? 5) What strategies can be used to promote cost savings through increased use of generic drugs? This article was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians. Best practice advice: Physicians should prescribe generic drugs, if possible, instead of more expensive brand-name drugs.",0,0,

Various strategies have been suggested. This study evaluates the impact of academic details and a computerized decision support system (CDSS) on physicians' prescribing behavior for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The management of all patients who attended the emergency department during three successive periods of time was evaluated"";"" the baseline periods, academic detail and CDSS. The rate of empiric antibiotic prescriptions consistent with recommendations was studied over time by comparing pre- and post-periods and using interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: The odds ratio for concordant therapy at the academic detail period, after adjustment for age, disease severity, and suspected aspiration, compared to the baseline period was OR = 2.79 [1.88, 4.14], p < 0.01, and for the computerized decision support period compared to the academic detail period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02. An improvement in appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing was demonstrated during the first few months of the computerized decision support period, which was greater than expected with time and academic details alone, based on predictions from a binary logistic model. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a computerized decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices that was greater than the changes seen with academic details. The sustainability of this intervention requires further evaluation.",1,1,
1014,Improving the use of antibiotics among hospitalists: a pilot project of academic detail with a public health approach,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is a major clinical problem and public health concern. We developed and implemented a pilot detailed academic hospitalist-delivered intervention to improve inpatient antibiotic prescribing patterns. OBJECTIVE: To improve antibiotic prescription patterns in the hospital service of an academic medical center. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Hospital physicians were recruited to participate in this pre- and post-intervention pilot study at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC). Public health principles to create a conceptual framework based on behavior change theory were used in the development of the intervention. METHODS: The antibiotic prescribing patterns of 17 hospital physicians were retrospectively reviewed. Antimicrobial prescriptions were classified as appropriate, effective but inappropriate, or inappropriate. A profile was created for each hospitalist and a detailed academic intervention session was scheduled. The session reviewed inappropriate prescribing practices as well as current practice guidelines. After the detailed meeting, the hospitalists' prescribing patterns were followed prospectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were the proportions of antibiotics prescribed inappropriately before the intervention, during the detailed period and after the intervention. RESULTS: Seventeen hospitalist physicians who participated in the study. A total of 247 pre-intervention prescriptions and 129 post-intervention prescriptions were reviewed. Before academic details, 43% (95% CI 37-49%) of prescriptions were appropriate and 57% (95% CI 51-63%) were inappropriate. After the intervention, 74% (95% CI 65%-81%) of the prescriptions were appropriate and 26% (95% CI 19%-35%) inappropriate"";"" p < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: A carefully planned and methodically executed intervention can result in behavior change, even among busy hospitalists.

1015,Improving Asthma Care in Emergency Departments: Results of a Multihospital Collaborative Quality Initiative in Rural Western North Carolina,"BACKGROUND: In North Carolina, nearly a quarter of people with asthma visit an emergency department (ED) or urgent care center at least once a year due to an exacerbation of asthma symptoms. The Emergency Department Asthma Program was a quality improvement initiative designed to better understand the patient population using the emergency department for asthma care in rural western North Carolina and to demonstrate whether emergency services in small hospitals could, through the implementation of the National Program for Education and Prevention of Asthma. guidelines, improve asthma care, and reduce subsequent asthma-related emergency department visits. METHODS: Eight hospitals in western North Carolina participated in the project, which lasted from November 2003 to December 2007. The intervention consisted of a series of individual and structured continuing medical education events for physicians and physicians. emergency personnel. In addition, patients presenting to emergency departments for asthma-related problems were selected to receive a brief patient questionnaire to determine their basic understanding of asthma and barriers to asthma care; to undergo asthma staging by the treating physician; to receive focused bedside asthma education by a respiratory therapist and finally, at the discretion of the treating physician, to receive a free package of asthma medications, including beta-agonist rescue therapy and corticosteroid therapy administered through a metered-dose inhaler, prior to discharge. month-long project, a total of 1,739 patients presented to participating EDs for 2,481 asthma-related episodes of care;"" in 11% of these visits, patients received the intervention, with nearly 100 emergency physicians referring patients to the program Most patients using the ED for asthma treatment were considered to have milder stages and nearly half were uninsured or covered by Medicaid Only 20% of visits identified a primary care physician or clinic Patient intervention did not appear to decrease the rate of subsequent visits for asthma-related symptoms at 30 and 60 days LIMITATIONS: Selection bias is likely, as patients enrolled in the study were more likely than patients in the target sample to be adults and to be insured.Because we did not measure the attendance of emergency personnel at sessions. education or their knowledge and attitudes about asthma care before and after the educational program, we cannot draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the program in changing their knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients who use the emergency department for care seem to have mild and intermittent asthma and do not identify a regular source of primary care. Efforts to improve asthma care throughout the community and to reduce preventable exacerbations should include care provided in emergency departments, as this may be the only source of asthma care for many patients with asthma. The project demonstrated that collaborative regional performance improvement efforts in EDs are possible, but that there are many barriers to this approach.",0,0,

1019,Improving cardiovascular risk management: a randomized controlled trial on the effect of a decision support tool for patients and physicians,"BACKGROUND: There is suboptimal adherence of general practitioners (GPs) and patients to interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk. General practitioners find it difficult to assimilate multiple risk factors into an accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk. In addition, it has been difficult to communicate cardiovascular risk to patients. OBJECTIVES: To improve the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in primary care by improving patient participation in the use of a decision support tool. DESIGN: Randomized cluster trial. METHODS: Thirty-four GPs enrolled patients (40-75 years) without CVD. In a 4-hour small group interactive training session, intervention group GPs were trained in the use of the cardiovascular risk guidelines and a decision support tool. The control group received educational materials on the paper guidelines. Physicians' clinical performance and patients' self-reported risk perception and lifestyles were measured at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-four physicians recorded 490 consultations, 276 in the intervention and 214 in the control group. After 6 months, no significant effect of the intervention on doctors' performance or patients' perception of risk was found. There was only an effect on self-reported lifestyle, as more men in the intervention group than in the control group increased their physical activity (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.7-8.7).

1020,Improving care for minority children with asthma: professional education in public health clinics,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that lack of ongoing primary care for asthma is associated with higher levels of morbidity in low-income minority children. Although effective preventive therapy exists, many African American and Latino children receive episodic asthma treatment that does not follow current guidelines of care. To see if access, continuity, and quality of care could be improved at pediatric clinics serving low-income children in New York City, we trained clinic staff from the New York City Office of Children's Health of New York to provide ongoing preventive care for asthma. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of the intervention over a 2-year period in a controlled study of 22 clinics. Training for intervention clinic staff was based on National Asthma Prevention and Education Program guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, and included screening to identify new cases and health education to improve family management . The intervention included strong administrative support from the Office of Child Health to promote staff behavior change. We hypothesized that after the intervention, clinics receiving the intervention, compared to control clinics, would have a greater number of children with asthma receiving ongoing care at the clinics and greater staff use of new treatment methods. pharmacological and educational. RESULTS: At both the first and second year of follow-up, intervention clinics had greater positive changes than control clinics on measures of access, continuity, and quality of care. For second-year follow-up data, these include: for access, a higher rate of new patients with asthma (40/1,000 vs. 16/1,000""; P < 0.01); for continuation, a higher percentage of patients with asthma than return for treatment 2 years in a row (42% vs 12%; P < 0.001) and higher annual frequency of scheduled asthma visits per patient (1.85 vs 0.88; P < 0.001), and by quality, higher percentage of patients receiving inhaled beta agonists (52% vs. 15%; P < .001) and inhaled anti-inflammatory medications (25% vs. 2%; P < .001), and higher percentages of parents reporting receiving patient education about 12 subjects of the Office of Child Health physicians (71% vs. 58%; p < 0.01) and nurses (61% vs. 44%; p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: We conclude that The intervention substantially increased the ability of Office of Children's Health staff to identify children with asthma, engage them in to ongoing care and provide them with advanced asthma care.",0,0,
1021,Improving Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Primary Care: Results from the BETTER Pragmatic Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Primary care provides most of the evidence-based chronic disease screening and prevention services offered by the health system. However, a gap remains between recommended preventive services and actual practice. This trial (the BETTER trial) aimed to improve preventive care for heart disease, diabetes, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer, and relevant lifestyle factors through an established practice facilitation intervention in the primary care. METHODS: Two-way pragmatic factorial cluster RCT with the practices of primary care physicians as the unit of allocation and individual patients as the unit of analysis. The setting was the urban practices of the Primary Care Team in two Canadian provinces. Eight Primary Care Team practices were randomly assigned to receive either practice-level intervention or waiting list control"";"" Four physicians from each team (32 physicians) were randomly assigned to receive either the patient-level intervention or the waiting list control. Patients randomly selected from physician lists were stratified into two groups: 1) general mental illness and 2) moderate mental illness. Interventions included a personalized, evidence-based, multifaceted practice-level intervention with a practice facilitator, and a patient-level intervention involving a one-hour visit with a prevention professional where patients received a ""prescription prevention "" personalized. The primary outcome was a composite summary quality index of 28 evidence-based chronic disease detection and prevention actions with predefined targets, expressed as the proportion of actions eligible at baseline that were met at follow-up. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: 789 of 1260 (63%) eligible patients participated. On average, patients were eligible for 8.96 (SD 3.2) shares at baseline. In adjusted analysis, control patients met 23.1% (95% CI: 19.2% to 27.1%) of target actions, compared to 28.5% (95% CI %: 20.9% to 36.0%) who received the intervention at the practice level, 55.6% (95% CI: 49.0% to 62.1%) who received the intervention at the practice level patient, and 58.9% (95% CI: 54.7% to 63.1%) who received practice- and patient-level interventions (patient-level intervention versus control, P < 0.001). The benefit of the patient-level intervention was seen in both strata. The extra cost of the intervention was $26.43 CAN (95% CI: $16 to $44) per additional action completed.

Methods We searched PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for intervention studies aiming to improve clinical handover between ICU and general healthcare professionals that had been published up to June 2013. inclusive. Article inclusion and data analysis were prespecified and aligned with the recommendations outlined in the PRISMA guideline. Two reviewers independently extracted data (study purpose, setting, population, sampling method, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcome, and implementation activities) and assessed the quality of included studies. Results Of the 6591 citations initially extracted from the six databases, 11 studies were included in this review. Of these, six (55%) reported statistically significant effects. Effective interventions included nurse liaisons to improve communication and coordination of care, and forms to facilitate timely, complete, and accurate handover information. Effective interventions resulted in better continuity of care (eg reduced delay in discharge) and reduced adverse events. Inconsistent effects were seen for use of care, namely reduced length of stay versus increased readmissions to higher care. No statistically significant effects were found in reducing mortality. The overall methodological quality of the 11 studies reviewed was relatively low, with a mean score of 4.5 out of 11 points. Conclusions This review shows that liaison nurses and handover forms are promising interventions to improve the quality of patient handover between the ICU and the general ward. Stronger evidence is needed on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving ICU handover and supportive implementation strategies.",0,1,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial using three parallel group practices in an urban public university hospital. SETTING: Public university hospital. SUBJECTS: All patients 65 years of age and older (n = 1202) cared for by resident physicians (n = 66) who attended three outpatient medical practices from October 1, 1989, to March 31, 1990. INTERVENTIONS: All three provider groups received intensive education on immunization standards. The control group received no further intervention. Staff in the second group provided patient education at their visits. In the third group, the prevention team, a flowchart was used, patient education was offered, and staff tasks were redefined to facilitate compliance"";"" for vaccinations, for example, nurses could vaccinate independently of the MD initiative. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records of 1,202 patients seen, including 756 patients seen during the 1988-89 and 1989-90 influenza seasons, were reviewed to determine documented offering and receipt of vaccines. During the intervention period (1989-1990), influenza vaccines were offered much more frequently to patients in the prevention team (68.3%) than to patients in the patient education groups (50.4 %) or control (47.6%) (P = 0.006). even after adjusting for patients' prior vaccination status, age, gender, race, and high-risk comorbidity, and physician training level. Similarly, pneumococcal vaccination was offered more frequently to previously unvaccinated prevention team patients (28.3%) than to patients in the patient education group (6.5%) or control group (5.4%). (p = 0.001), even after adjusting for factors using multivariate analysis. Compliance rates did not differ between patient education and control subjects for either vaccine. Preintervention physician surveys documented higher perceived than actual compliance for both vaccines, with 89.0% and 52.8% of physicians believing they were compliant with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination guidelines, respectively . CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial provide strong support for organizational changes involving non-medical personnel to improve vaccination rates among older adults.",0,1,
1024,Improving preventive health care delivery with the Comprehensive Annotated Reminder Tool (CART),"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effect of the Comprehensive Annotated Reminder Tool (CART) on physicians' adherence to preventive service recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a pre-post trial randomized control group design, we assigned physicians to either the CART group or the control group, performed prospective follow-up, and assessed appropriate adherence to guidelines. The 3 age-specific versions of the CART Annotated History and Physical Exam form contained up to 49 preventive service recommendations. POPULATION: All resident physicians in a large family medicine residency program were studied over the course of 1 academic year. MEASURED OUTCOMES: We conducted blind chart reviews to assess the appropriateness of physician-ordered preventive services before CART was introduced, during its use, and after its withdrawal. A multiple choice test completed before and after the use of the CART forms assessed knowledge. RESULTS: When CART was used, the adequacy of physician preventive behavior increased by 21% overall. The adequacy of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory interventions increased by 33%. When CART was withdrawn, physician behavior returned to baseline (P < or = 0.0025 for 16 of 20 interventions). No significant differences were observed in the control group over time. Knowledge increased over the study period for all physicians (P < or = 0.005), but did not differ significantly between treatment and control groups (P = 0.608).

1027,Improving physicians' prescribing behavior through reflection on guidelines and prescribing feedback: a randomized controlled study.,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to translate research findings into clinical practice through prescribing guidelines or commentary. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect on prescribing quality by a combined intervention of providing individual feedback and deriving quality criteria using guideline recommendations in peer review groups. METHODS: 199 general practitioners in 32 groups were randomized to participate in peer review meetings related to asthma or urinary tract infections. Dispensing of antiasthmatic drugs and antibiotics by participating physicians during the year prior to the intervention period provided the basis for prescribing feedback. Intervention feedback was designed to describe the treatment given in relation to national guideline recommendations. In each group, the doctors agreed on quality criteria for their own treatment of the corresponding diseases based on these recommendations. Comparing their prescribing feedback to their own quality criteria gave each doctor the ratio of acceptable and unacceptable treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in prescribing behavior between the year before and the year after the intervention. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the mean proportions of patients with asthma acceptably treated in the asthma group and the urinary tract infection (control) group were 28% and 27%, respectively. The mean proportion of acceptably treated patients in the asthma group increased by 6% relative to the control group"";"" This difference was statistically significant. The mean proportions of acceptable UTI treatments before intervention in the UTI group and the asthma (control) group were 12% for both groups, which increased by 13% in the UTI group relative to the control group. Relative to pre-intervention mean values, this represented a treatment improvement of 21% in the asthma group and 108% in the urinary tract infection group. CONCLUSIONS: Deriving prescribing quality criteria through discussion of guideline recommendations provided clinicians with a basis for judging the treatment of individual patients as acceptable or unacceptable. Presented with feedback on their own prescription, they learned what they did right and wrong. This provided a basis for improvement and the process thus instigated resulted in physicians providing better quality patient care.",0,1,

We developed and tested a computerized antibiotic advisor to assist clinicians in the selection of appropriate empiric antibiotics. Methods: We used a two-stage randomized study to compare antibiotic specialist-suggested antibiotics with 482 associated antibiotic susceptibility scores and physician-ordered concurrent antibiotics. Randomized physician-ordered antibiotics were then compared across periods of antibiotic consultant use. Results: The antibiotic specialist suggested an antibiotic regimen to which all pathogen isolates were found to be susceptible in 453 (94%) of 482 culture results, while the physicians indicated an antibiotic regimen to which all pathogen isolates were susceptible in 369 results. culture (77%) (p < 0.001). Physicians who prescribed antibiotics to which all pathogens were susceptible did so a mean of 21 hours after the culture samples were collected. Physicians ordered the appropriate antibiotics within 12 hours of culture collection significantly more frequently when using the antibiotic consultant than during the period before use (p < 0.035). Additionally, 88% of physicians said they would recommend the program to other physicians, 85% said the program improved their antibiotic selection, and 81% said they felt using the program improved patient care. Conclusions: Information from computerized medical records can be used to help improve clinicians' selection of empiric antibiotics for infections. (Arch Intern Med. 1994"";""154:878-884)",0,1,
1029,"Improving empiric antibiotic therapy using TREAT, a computerized decision support system: cluster randomized trial.","Background: Adequate antibiotic treatment decreases mortality, while superfluous treatment is associated with antibiotic resistance. We built a computerized decision support system for antibiotic treatment (TREAT) targeting these outcomes. Methods: Prospective cohort study comparing TREAT advice with physician treatment, followed by a cluster randomized trial comparing wards using TREAT (intervention) versus antibiotic control without TREAT (control). Patients suspected of harboring bacterial infections in three hospitals (Israel, Germany and Italy) were included. The primary outcome, appropriate antibiotic treatment, was evaluated among patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDI). Length of hospital stay, adverse events, mortality (intervention trial), and antibiotic costs (both studies), including costs related to future antibiotic resistance, were compared among all included patients. Results: Among 1,203 patients included in the cohort study (350 with MDI), TREAT prescribed appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy significantly more frequently than did physicians (70% versus 57%, P < 0.001) using fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics at half of doctors' antibiotic costs. The randomized trial included 2,326 patients, 570 with MDI.

1031,Improving feedback on prescribing errors from young physicians: a mixed methods evaluation of a quality improvement project.,"Background Prescription errors occur in up to 15% of inpatient drug orders in the UK. However, young doctors report insufficient feedback on errors. One barrier to feedback is that individual prescribers often cannot be clearly identified in prescription documentation. Objective To reduce prescribing errors in a UK hospital by improving feedback on prescribing errors. Interventions We developed three linked interventions using cycles of plan-do-study-act: (1) name stamps for young doctors who were encouraged to stamp or write their name clearly when prescribing"";"" (2) effective feedback principles to help pharmacists provide feedback to physicians on individual prescribing errors and (3) bi-weekly prescribing advice emails that addressed a common and/or serious error. Implementation and evaluation Interventions were introduced at one hospital site in August 2013 with a second serving as a control. Process measures included the percentage of inpatient drug orders for which junior physicians indicated their name. Outcome measures were trainee physicians' and pharmacists' perceptions of current feedback provision (assessed using quantitative pre-post questionnaires and qualitative focus groups) and the prevalence of erroneous medication orders written by trainee physicians between August and December 2013. Findings The percentage of drug orders for which young doctors gave their name increased from about 10% to 50%. Responses to the questionnaire revealed a significant improvement in perceptions for pharmacists, but no significant change for physicians. Findings from the focus groups suggested greater involvement of physicians in safe prescribing. Interrupted time series analysis showed no difference in weekly prescription error rates between the baseline and intervention periods, compared to the control site. Conclusion The findings suggest enhanced experiences around feedback. However, attempts to produce a measurable reduction in prescribing errors are likely to require a multifaceted approach of which feedback should be a part.",0,1,
1032,Improving Guideline Compliance: A Randomized Trial Evaluating Strategies to Increase Beta-Blocker Use in Heart Failure,"Background: The dissemination of clinical practice guidelines has often not been accompanied by the desired improvements in guideline compliance. This study evaluated interventions to implement a new practice guideline recommending the use of ß-blockers for patients with heart failure. Methods and results: This was a randomized controlled trial involving heart failure patients (n=169) with ejection fraction ≥45% and no contraindications to ß-blockers. Patients' primary providers were randomized in a stratified design to 1 of 3 interventions: (1) control: provider education""; (2) provider and patient notification: computerized provider reminders and letters to patients recommending ß-blockers""; and (3) nurse facilitator: supervised nurse to initiate and titrate ß-blockers. The primary outcome, the proportion of patients who started or increased titration and remained on ß-blockers, analyzed by intention-to-treat, was achieved by 67% (36 of 54) of patients in the nurse facilitator group compared with 16% (10 of 64) in provider/patient notification and 27% (14 of 51) in the control groups (P<0.001 for comparisons between the nurse facilitator group and the other two groups). The proportion of patients with target doses of ß-blockers at the end of the study (median follow-up, 12 months) was also higher in the nursing facilitator group (43%) compared with the control (10%) and the nursing facilitator groups. provider/patient notification (2%) (P<0.001). There were no differences in adverse events between the groups. Conclusions: The use of a nurse facilitator was a successful approach to implement a ß-blocker regimen in patients with heart failure.

1033,Improving nurses' hand hygiene behavior through action planning: a pilot study in the intensive care unit and operating room,"Compliance with hand hygiene guidelines by hospital doctors and nurses is universally low and there is a need to apply powerful social science intervention methods to improve compliance. One method is the formation of implementation intentions (or action plans) in which concrete ""if-then"" plans are formulated to link an environmental cue to the performance of an intended behavioral action. This pilot study explored the practicality and effects of action planning on the hand hygiene behavior (HHB) of nurses in an ICU and surgical suite of a university teaching hospital. A pre-post test design was used and 17 nurses were invited to participate. A trained researcher observed HHB of nurses before and three weeks after the intervention in which action plans were formulated. Frequencies were calculated and logistic regression analysis was performed to assess changes in HHB. Of the 17 participants, 10 (seven in the OR, three in the ICU) had complete data and were included in the analyses. In total, 283 potential moments for hand hygiene were identified, 142 in the operating room and 141 in the ICU. HHB increased from 9.3% at baseline to 25.4% after intervention (odds ratio: 3.3""; confidence interval: 1.7-6.5;"" P<0.001). Although this was a small-scale study, the results are promising for the use of action planning to improve nurses' HHB in the short term. Action planning has been successful in bridging the gap between intention and behavior in other fields, and its use to improve HHB in health care needs to be further investigated.",1,1,
1034,Improve handover from critical care to ward medical teams with simple paperwork changes,"Medical handover has been highlighted by the General Medical Council[1] as a critical step in patient care, ensuring continuity of care, patient safety, and enabling efficient multidisciplinary operation. Handover between intensive care team physicians and Great Western Hospital ward teams was assessed by reviewing discharge summaries and patient notes, and by following up with discharged patients. Carryover was found to be present in only a minority of patients and was not documented in any. Simple changes were made to offload paperwork in the form of a notice and documentation of who the transfer was made to, as well as creating a space on daily review sheets for pending transfer patients to complete. The initial results of the audit were presented at a local meeting to remind staff of the importance of the handover. These simple modifications raised carryover rates to 100% (n=12). Delivery documentation rates also increased from 0% to 100%. This quality improvement project serves to demonstrate that simple, carefully targeted practice changes in identified critical areas can produce dramatic results, in addition to those legally and ethically required, in a very short space of time.",1,1,
1035,Improving knowledge and changing behavior toward guideline-based decisions in diabetes care: a controlled intervention study of a team-learning approach to continuing professional development for clinicians.,"BACKGROUND: Ideally, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses should enhance a physician's knowledge and change their professional behavior in daily practice towards a reference model of best clinical practice and adherence to guidelines. Interactive methods, such as team learning and case-based learning, compared to lectures, can impart sustainable knowledge and generate high satisfaction among the participants. We designed an interactive case-based CPD seminar on diabetes care using a team learning approach to assess whether it leads to short-term knowledge improvement and behavior change toward guideline-based decisions and how participants perceive this approach. Learning. . METHODS: Questionnaires and an electronic voting system were used to assess the motivation, acceptance, and knowledge of volunteer participants. In addition, we analyzed data on index diagnostic tests and referrals of patients with diabetes from participating physicians over a six-month period before and after the course compared with a matched control group in a quasi-experimental design. RESULTS: Participants (n=103) rated interactivity and team discussions as the main reasons for improving learning. They also hoped that the course would change their professional behavior. The participants obtained a mean of 43.9% correct answers before and 62.6% after the course (p<0.001). Referral to diabetes specialists increased by 30.8% (p<0.001). Referral for fundoscopy also increased (8.5%, ns) while it decreased in the control group. In addition, participating physicians screened their patients more frequently for microalbuminuria (7.1%, ns). CONCLUSIONS: Our team-based learning CPD approach was well accepted and resulted in short-term knowledge gains. Referral to diabetes specialists in daily practice increased significantly, while all other key indicators of professional behavior changed, but not significantly.",0,0,
1036,Improving laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy in ambulatory care: a randomized trial.,"Background The importance of laboratory monitoring of drugs is reflected in product labeling and published guidelines, but monitoring recommendations are inconsistently followed. There is an opportunity to improve monitoring, with the potential to decrease complications of therapy. Methods The objective of this randomized trial was to determine whether computerized alerts were effective in increasing the percentage of outpatients with laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy. Physicians and pharmacists came together to develop organization-specific guidelines for monitoring select medications. In collaboration with physicians, pharmacists were alerted to missing lab test results, ordered missing tests, reminded patients to take tests, evaluated test completion, reviewed test results, and abnormal results were handled. Eligible persons included patients started on therapy for any of the 15 medications among 400,000 health plan members. Results In the intervention group, 79.1% (n = 4,076""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 78.0%-80.2%) of dispensations were controlled compared with 70.2% % (n = 3,522; ""95% CI, 68.9%-71.5%) in the usual care group (p < 0.001). For example, 78.6% of amiodarone dispensing (95% CI, 73.1%-83.5%) in the intervention group was controlled versus 51.4% (95% CI, 44.4% -58.4%) in the group that received usual care (p < 0.001). ). Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a computerized tool plus collaboration between health professionals to increase the percentage of patients receiving laboratory monitoring at the start of therapy. Combining the data available from information systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can result in better patient monitoring.",0,1,
1037,Improving mammography recommendation: a nurse-initiated intervention,"We seek to improve our compliance with recommendations for screening mammography, in accordance with the American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines, for eligible patients seen by family medicine residents by using a multipart intervention designed to eliminate the identified barriers of knowledge and behavior by residents. Copies of the ACS Cancer Screening Guidelines were posted in all exam and conference rooms and given to all residents. The intervention that addressed behavioral barriers had three components: (1) identification by nursing staff of eligible women who were overdue for a mammogram when they presented for care, (2) completion of a checklist by residents indicating whether or not a mammogram was recommended and why, and (3) a nurse-initiated backup reminder system for patients who escaped the main checklist system. An audit of 200 pre-intervention and 270 post-intervention charts showed statistically and clinically significant increases in recommended or performed mammograms. Similar statistically significant increases were found in a cohort of 111 patient records at pre- and post-intervention audits. Results indicate that an intervention designed to remove identified resident-dependent barriers to adherence to screening mammography guidelines may be effective in increasing recommended mammography rates.",0,0,
1038,Improving Medication Management in Multimorbidity: Development of the Multimorbidity COllaborative Medication Review and Decision Making (MY COMRADE) Intervention Using the Behavior Change Wheel,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more chronic conditions, affects more than 60% of patients in primary care. Due to its association with polypharmacy, the development of interventions to optimize medication management in patients with multimorbidity is a priority. The Behavior Change Wheel is a new approach to applying behavioral theory to the development of interventions. Here, we describe how we have used the results of a review of previous research, our own original research, and the Behavior Change Wheel to develop an intervention to improve medication management in multimorbidity by general practitioners (GPs), within the Council. UK Medical Research. guidance on complex interventions. METHODS: Following the steps of the Behavior Change Wheel, we searched for behaviors associated with medication management in multimorbidity by conducting a systematic review and qualitative study with GPs. Of the modifiable GP behaviors identified, we selected one and conducted a focused behavioral analysis to explain why GPs were or were not engaging in this behaviour. We use behavior analysis to determine the intervention functions, behavior change techniques, and implementation plan most likely to effect behavior change. RESULTS: We identified numerous modifiable GP behaviors in the systematic review and qualitative study, of which active medication review (rather than passive maintenance of the status quo) was chosen as the target behavior. Behavioral analysis revealed the capacities, opportunities and motivations of GPs in relation to active medication review. We combined the three intervention functions that were considered most likely to effect behavior change (enabling, environmental restructuring, and incentive) to form the Multimorbidity COllaborative Medication Review and Decision Making (MY COMRADE) intervention. MY COMRADE mainly involves the technique of social support: two general practitioners together review the medications prescribed to a complex multimorbid patient. Four other behavior change techniques are incorporated: restructuring of the social environment, prompts/signals, action planning, and self-incentives. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use the behavior change wheel to develop an intervention targeting multimorbidity and confirms the ease of use and utility of the approach in a complex area of clinical care. The systematic development of the MY COMRADE intervention will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness in the next phase of this work.",0,1,
1039,Improving Mental Health Care Transitions for Children and Youth: A Protocol for Implementing and Evaluating an Emergency Department Clinical Pathway,"Background Although the emergency department (ED) is often the first point of entry for children and youth with mental health (MH) problems, there is limited capacity to respond to HM needs in this setting. HM systems for children are often fragmented across various ministries, organizations and providers. Communication between these groups is often poor, creating gaps, particularly in care transitions, for this vulnerable population. The evidence-based Emergency Department Mental Health Clinical Pathway (EDMHCP) was created with two main goals: (1) to guide risk assessment and decision making about the disposition of children and youth presenting to the ED with mental health concerns, and (2) provide a streamlined transition to follow-up services with Community MH Agencies (CMHAs) and other providers. The purpose of this article is to describe our study protocol for implementing and evaluating the EDMHCP. Methods/Design This mixed methods health services research project will involve the implementation and evaluation of the EDMHCP in four exemplary ED-CMHA dyads. The theoretical domains framework will be used to develop a customized intervention strategy to implement the EDMHCP. A multiple benchmark study design and interrupted time series analysis will be used to determine whether the EDMHCP has improved health care utilization, medical management of mental health problems, and health sector coordination. The primary outcome of the process will be the proportion of patients with specific HH recommendations documented in the health record. The primary outcome of the service will be the proportion of patients receiving the EDMHCP-recommended follow-up at 24 hours or 7 days. Data sources will include qualitative interviews, health record audits, administrative databases, and patient surveys. A concurrent process evaluation will be conducted to assess the degree of variability and fidelity in implementation at sites. Discussion This article presents a novel model to measure the effects of the EDMHCP. Our development process will identify how the EDMHCP is best implemented among partner organizations to provide evidence-based risk management for children and youth with mental health concerns. More broadly, it will contribute to the body of evidence supporting the implementation of clinical pathways within novel partnerships.",0,0,
1040,"Improving Opioid Safety Practices in Primary Care: Protocol for the Development and Evaluation of a Multifaceted, Theory-Informed Pilot Intervention for Healthcare Providers","INTRODUCTION: In North America, drug overdose deaths are reaching unprecedented levels, largely driven by the rise in deaths related to prescription opioids. Despite the development of various opioid guidelines, prescribing behaviors still contribute to poor patient outcomes and societal harm. Provider and system-level factors can make it difficult or easy to apply evidence-based guidelines"";"" Interventions designed to address such factors are needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using implementation science and behavior change theory, we have planned the development and evaluation of a comprehensive Opioid Self-Assessment Package, designed to increase adherence to the Canadian Opioid Guidelines among family physicians. . The intervention uses practical self-assessment and educational tools to provide clinicians with feedback on their current knowledge and practices, and resources to improve their practice. The evaluation approach uses a pre-post test design and includes both quantitative and qualitative methods at baseline and at 6 months. We will recruit a purposive sample of approximately 10 family physicians in Ontario from various practice settings, who are currently treating patients on long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Quantitative data will be analyzed using basic descriptive statistics and qualitative data will be analyzed using the Framework Method. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Research Ethics Council of the University Health Network approved this study. The dissemination plan includes publications, conference presentations and brief reports from stakeholders. This evidence-based, theory-driven intervention has implications for the national application of opioid quality improvement tools in primary care settings. We are engaging experts and end-users in advisory roles and stakeholders throughout our project to increase its national relevance, application and sustainability. Performance measures could be used as the basis for health system quality improvement indicators to monitor opioid prescribing. In addition, the methods and approach used in this study could be adapted to other opioid guidelines or applied to other areas of preventive health care and clinical guideline implementation processes.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General practices from two regions in the Sydney metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: 150 general practitioners, who were recruited between 2006 and 2008, and 221 children with asthma in their care. INTERVENTION: GPs from the intervention group participated in two 3-hour workshops, focusing on communication and education strategies to facilitate quality asthma care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient outcomes included receipt of an asthma action plan (WAAP), appropriate medication use, parental days absent from work, and days absent from work. from the child to school or daycare. GP outcomes included frequency of providing a WAAP and patient education, communication and teaching behavior, and compliance with national asthma guidelines regarding medication use. RESULTS: More GP patients in the intervention group reported receiving a WAAP (difference, 15%""; 95% CI, 2% to 28%; adjusted P = .046). In the intervention group, children with infrequent intermittent asthma symptoms had lower use of inhaled corticosteroids (difference, 24%; 95% CI, -43% to -5%; P = .03) and long-acting bronchodilators (difference, 19%; 95% CI). %, -34% to -5%; P = 0.02).GPs in the intervention group were more confident in communicating with patients (difference 22%; 95% CI, 3% to 40%; P = 0.03) A higher proportion of GPs in the intervention group reported providing a WAAP more than 70% of the time (difference, 23%; 95% CI, 11% to 36%; adjusted P = 0.002) and prescription of spacer devices more than 90% of the time (difference, 29%; 95% CI, 16% to 42%; adjusted P=0.02).

1042,Improving patient care through medical imaging perception research,"The interpretation of medical images in all medical specialties is essential for patient care. As technology changes, so does healthcare, and today's physicians increasingly view medical images in a variety of settings. Although access to such data is helpful, even clinicians experienced in image interpretation make mistakes. These errors may become more frequent as clinicians' work days grow longer and the number of images to interpret increases. To avoid errors in medical image interpretation, we must understand the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that guide image interpretation. We can then use what we've learned to develop better training methods, automated image analysis, and processing tools. We can devise methods to reduce physician fatigue and stress, and develop practice guidelines, thereby improving patient care and outcomes.",0,1,
1043,Improve patient discharge and reduce hospital readmissions by mapping interventions,"Background There is a growing push to reorganize the hospital discharge process to reduce readmissions and avoidable costs. The goal of this study was to provide insight into hospital discharge issues and underlying causes, and to provide an overview of solutions that guide providers and policymakers to improve hospital discharge. Methods The Intervention Mapping framework was used. In the first place, an analysis of the problem was carried out, studying the magnitude, causes and consequences of ineffective hospital discharge. The analysis was based on primary data from 26 focus group interviews and 321 individual interviews with patients and family members, and involved hospital and community care providers. Second, improvements in terms of intervention outcomes, performance targets, and change targets were specified. Third, 220 experts were consulted and a systematic review of effective discharge interventions was conducted to select the theory-based methods and practical strategies needed to achieve change and better performance. Results Ineffective discharge is related to factors at the level of the individual care provider, the patient, the relationship between providers, and organizational and technical support for care providers. Providers can reduce hospital readmission rates and adverse events by focusing on high-quality discharge information, well-coordinated care, and direct and timely communication with their peer counterparts. Patients, or their caregivers, should be involved in the discharge process and be aware of their health status and treatment. Hospital care providers' assessment of whether discharge information is accurate and understood by patients and their community counterparts are important examples of overcoming identified barriers to effective discharge. Discharge templates, medication reconciliation, a liaison nurse or pharmacist, regular site visits, and post-teaching are identified as effective and promising strategies for achieving desired behavioral and environmental change. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive guidance framework for providers and policymakers to improve the transfer of patients from hospital to primary care.",0,1,
1044,Improving physician compliance with preventive medicine guidelines,"Similar general practice outpatient clinics with randomized patients were used to assess the efficacy of a program that aimed to increase in-house staff compliance with preventive medicine guidelines. Two clinics were designated experimental and two served as controls. In the experimental clinics, age-specific checklists of all recommended preventive procedures (excerpted from the report of the Canadian Task Force on Periodic Health Examination and the American Cancer Society guidelines) were attached to each patient's chart. . In addition, house officials were presented with a series of weekly seminars that address screening issues as well as the specific recommendations included in the checklist. The internal staff of the four clinics were evaluated for their knowledge and attitudes towards the preventive program before and after the intervention. Counts of immunizations and mammograms performed and the total populations eligible for these procedures were determined for the four clinics. As predicted, test scores as well as mammography and immunization rates increased significantly (from 2 to 40 percent) in intervention clinics compared to controls. We conclude that this intervention was clearly effective in the short term. However, follow-up studies will be necessary to determine if the desired long-term effect has been achieved.",0,1,
1045,Improving population-based cervical cancer screening in general practice: effects of a national strategy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a Dutch national prevention programme, targeting general practitioners (GPs), on adherence to organizational guidelines for effective cervical cancer screening in general practice. Identify the characteristics of general practices that determine success. DESIGN: A prospective questionnaire study with pre-post measurement (before and 15 months after the introduction of the national program). SETTING AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of one third of 4,758 Dutch general practices. A GP was asked to participate per practice. INTERVENTION: A national GP prevention program to improve population-based cervical cancer prevention that combines several methods to improve quality in general practice, conducted at national, district, and practice levels. Outreach visitors were a key strategy for generating behavior change. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of practices adhering to 10 recommendations (across four guidelines) for organizing effective cervical cancer screening. RESULTS: After 15 months, all Dutch practices showed a significant improvement in compliance with nine of the 10 recommendations. Two recommendations, in particular 'identify women who should be medically excluded from screening' and 'reminder those who do not comply', showed the largest absolute increases of 26% and 33%, respectively. In addition to more intensive support from outreach visitors, practice features such as 'computerization' and 'delegation of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant' were important in improving adherence to guidelines. CONCLUSION: The national programme, with a combination of various quality improvement methods, appeared to be effective in improving the organization of cervical screening in general practice. Computerization and, to a lesser extent, the delegation of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant and more intensive support to practices, positively influenced the effectiveness of the national programme.",0,0,
1046,Improving prescribing patterns for the elderly through an online medication utilization review intervention,"Context.— Pharmacotherapy is among the most powerful interventions to improve health outcomes in the elderly. However, as some medications are less appropriate for older patients, systems approaches to improve pharmaceutical care may be an effective way to reduce inappropriate medication use. Objective.— To determine whether a computerized drug utilization review (DUR) database linked to a telepharmacy intervention can improve suboptimal medication use in the elderly. Design.— Population-based cohort design, April 1, 1996, through March 31, 1997. Setting.— Ambulatory care. Patients.—A total of 23,269 patients age 65 and older in the United States who received prescription drug benefits from a large pharmacy benefit manager during a 12-month period. Intervention.â€”Assessment of provider prescribing through an online computerized DUR database using explicit criteria to identify potentially inappropriate medication use in the elderly. The computer alerts triggered phone calls to physicians by pharmacists with training in geriatrics, in which the principles of geriatric pharmacology along with therapeutic substitution options were discussed. Main outcome measures.— Physician contact rate and rate of change to suggested drug regimen. Results.— A total of 43,007 alerts were activated. Out of a total of 43,007 telepharmacy calls generated by the alerts, we were able to reach 19,368 physicians regarding 24,266 alerts (56%). The rate of switching to a more appropriate therapeutic agent was 24% (5,860), but ranged from 40% for long half-life benzodiazepines to 2% to 7% for drugs that were theoretically contraindicated by history. self-reported by patients. Except for the rate of change of ß-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all rates of change were significantly greater than the expected baseline rate of change of 2%. Conclusions.— Using a system that integrates computers, pharmacists, and physicians, our large-scale intervention improved prescribing patterns and quality of care and thus provides a population-based approach to advancing geriatric clinical pharmacology. . Future research should focus on demonstrating better health outcomes as a result of better prescription options for the elderly.",0,1,
1047,Improving quality improvement using achievable benchmarks for clinician feedback: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Performance feedback and benchmarking, common tools for improving health care, are rarely studied in randomized trials. Achievable Care Benchmarks (ABCs) are standards of excellence achieved by the best in a peer group and are easily and reproducibly calculated from existing performance data. Objective To assess the effectiveness of using achievable benchmarks to improve typical physician performance feedback and improve care. Design Cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in December 1996, with follow-up to 1998. Setting and participants Seventy community physicians and 2978 fee-for-service Medicare patients with diabetes mellitus who were part of the Ambulatory Care Quality Improvement Project in Alabama. Intervention Physicians were randomly assigned to receive either a multimodal improvement intervention, including chart review and physician-specific feedback (comparison group""; n = 35) or an identical intervention plus achievable baseline feedback (experimental group; n = 35).Main outcome measure Pre-intervention (1994-1995) to post-intervention (1997-1998) changes in the proportion of patients who received influenza vaccination; foot exam;"" and each of the 3 blood tests that measure glucose control, cholesterol level, and triglyceride level, compared between the 2 groups. Results The proportion of patients who received the influenza vaccine improved from 40% to 58% in the experimental group (p < 0.001) versus 40% to 46% in the comparison group (p = 0.02). The odds ratios (ORs) for patients of attainable referral physicians versus comparison physicians who received adequate care postintervention, adjusted for preintervention care and nesting of patients within physicians, were 1, 57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.96) for influenza vaccination, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.69) for foot exam, and 1. 33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69) for the measurement of long-term glucose control. For cholesterol and serum triglycerides, the achievable baseline effect was statistically significant only after additional adjustment for physician characteristics (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.08-1.82] and OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.09-1.79], respectively). Conclusion The use of achievable benchmarks significantly improves the effectiveness of physician performance feedback in the setting of a multimodal quality improvement intervention.",1,1,
1048,Improving the quality of delirium care in a general medical service with established interdisciplinary care: a controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to improve the detection, prevention, and treatment of delirium. OBJECTIVES: To implement delirium guidelines in general medical patients to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium and improve outcomes in patients with delirium. METHODS: Implementation was carried out by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and project staff in a medical room. The evaluation was carried out as a controlled trial in patients 65 years of age or older with/at risk of delirium, compared to a medical ward control. Interventions included risk screening, delirium screening, multidisciplinary education, ward modifications including a four-bed delirium bay, behavioral and medication protocols, and the use of nursing assistants and volunteers. Primary outcome measures were incidence and duration of delirium"";"" secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, mortality, falls, and discharge destination in the delirium subgroup. Process measures included room changes, use of neuroleptics, allied health check, and use of the delirium bay. RESULTS: Of 206 consenting older medical patients, 22% were delusional on admission and 44% were at risk. No incident cases of delirium were identified. In the subgroup with delirium, significantly fewer intervention participants were discharged with persistent delirium (32% vs. 71%, P = .016), with trends toward reduced hospital mortality (0% vs. 18.5% , P = .07) and falls (11% vs. 22%, P = .16), at the expense of a longer stay in the medical room (16 days vs. 8 days, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of new delusions may reflect the established interdisciplinary care environment. The improved results in the delirium group are encouraging, although implementation was costly, including a longer length of stay in the acute ward.",0,0,
1049,Improving resident compliance with ambulatory care standards: results from the VA Cooperative Study on Computerized Reminders.,"Context Computerized systems for reminding clinicians to provide appropriate care have not been extensively evaluated in large numbers of patients in multiple clinical settings. Objective To examine whether a computerized reminder system operating in multiple Veterans Affairs (VA) ambulatory care clinics improves resident physician compliance with ambulatory care standards. Design, Setting, and Participants A total of 275 resident physicians at 12 VA medical centers were randomized in company or half-day clinic blocks to a recall group (n = 132) or a control group (n = 143). . During a 17-month study period (January 31, 1995 to June 30, 1996), residents cared for 12,989 unique patients who applied at least 1 of the studied standards of care (SOC). Main outcome measures Compliance with 13 SOCs, tracked using hospital databases and resident-completed encounter forms, compared between residents in the recall group versus those in the control group. Results Measuring adherence as the proportion of patients who adhered to all applicable SOCs at their last visit during the study period, the reminder group had statistically significantly higher adherence rates than the control group for all standards combined (58.8% vs. 53.5%""; odds [OR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.42; P = .002) and for 5 of 13 standards examined individually.Measuring adherence as the proportion of all visits for which care was indicated in which residents provided adequate care, the reminder group also had statistically significantly higher adherence rates than the recall group. control for all standards combined (17.9% vs. 12.2%; OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.45-1.71;"" P < .001) and for 9 of 13 standards individually examined. However, the benefit of reminders diminished throughout the study, although reminders remained active. Conclusions Our data indicate that reminder systems installed at multiple sites can improve residents' compliance with multiple SOCs. The benefits of such systems, however, appear to deteriorate over time. Future research should explore methods to better maintain the benefits of reminders.",0,1,
1050,Improving Smoking Cessation Counseling Using a Point-of-Care Health Intervention (IT) Tool: From the Virginia Practice Support and Research Network (VaPSRN),"PURPOSE: Primary care practices are an ideal setting to reduce national smoking rates because >70% of smokers visit their physician annually, yet cessation counseling is inconsistently provided to patients. We designed and built a novel software program for handheld computers and hypothesized that it would enhance clinicians' ability to provide personalized point-of-care smoking cessation counseling. METHODS: A portable computer program based on the smoking cessation guidelines and an adaptation of widely accepted theories of behavior change was created. The tool was evaluated using a validated before/after survey to measure clinicians' counseling behaviors, knowledge, and comfort/self-efficacy in quitting smoking. RESULTS: Participants included 17 physicians (mean age, 41 years; 71% men; 5 medical residents) from a practice-based research network. After 4 months of use in direct patient care, physicians were more likely to advise patients to quit smoking (P = 0.049) and reported increased use of the ""5 A's"" (P = 0, 03). Greater self-efficacy was observed when advising patients on smoking cessation (p = 0.006), as well as greater comfort when following up with patients (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a laptop software tool improved smoking cessation counseling among clinicians and shows promise for translating evidence on smoking cessation counseling into practice and educational settings.",0,1,
1051,Improving test ordering in primary care: the added value of a small group quality improvement strategy compared to classical feedback alone,"PURPOSE: We wanted to assess the added value of small peer group quality improvement meetings compared to simple feedback as a strategy to improve test requesting behaviour. The number of tests ordered by primary care physicians is increasing, and many of these tests appear to be unnecessary according to established evidence-based guidelines. METHODS: We enrolled 194 primary care physicians from 27 local primary care practice groups in 5 health care regions (5 diagnostic centers). The study was a cluster randomized trial with randomization at the local medical group level. We evaluated an innovative, multifaceted approach, combining written comparative feedback, group education on national guidelines, and social peer influence in small-group quality improvement sessions. The strategy targeted 3 specific clinical themes: cardiovascular problems, upper abdominal discomfort, and lower abdominal discomfort. The mean number of tests per physician every 6 months at the start of the study and the region of the physicians were used as independent variables, and the mean number of tests per physician every 6 months was the dependent variable. RESULTS: The new strategy was implemented in 13 primary care groups, while 14 groups only received feedback. For the 3 clinical subjects, the decrease in the mean total number of tests ordered by physicians in the intervention arm was much more substantial (on average, 51 fewer tests per physician every half year) than the decrease in the mean number of tests. ordered by physicians in the intervention group. the feedback arm (P = .005). Five tests deemed inappropriate for the clinical problem of upper abdominal discomfort decreased in the intervention arm, and clinicians in the feedback arm ordered 13 more tests every 6 months (P = 0.002). Physician variation in test ordering decreased more in the intervention arm. CONCLUSION: Compared with disseminating comparative feedback reports to primary care physicians, the new strategy of engaging peer interaction and social influence improved physicians' test requesting behavior. To be effective, feedback must be embedded in an interactive educational environment.",0,1,
1052,Improving implementation of a practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior by training all staff in departments of psychiatry through an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program: study protocol for a trial random controlled,"BACKGROUND: In 2012, a multidisciplinary practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior was issued in the Netherlands. The publication of guidelines often fails to change professional behavior due to multiple barriers. Structured implementation can improve adherence to guidelines. This article describes the design of a study that measures the effect of a Train-the-Trainer program supported by e-learning that aims to train all staff in departments in the application of the guide. We presume that both professionals and departments will benefit from the program. METHOD: In a multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial, 43 psychiatric departments spread across 10 regional mental health institutions in the Netherlands will be paired with respect to the most prevalent diagnostic category of patients and the average duration of treatment. The members of the pair are randomly assigned to the experimental or control condition. In the experimental condition, all department staff, i.e., all registered nurses, psychologists, physicians, and psychiatrists (n = 532, 21 departments) will be trained in the application of the guideline, in a one-day interactive small group. Train - the Trainer program. The program is supported by a 60-minute e-learning module with video vignettes of suicidal patients and additional instruction. In the control condition (22 departments, 404 professionals), the guideline will be disseminated in the traditional way: through manuals, books, conferences, the Internet, magazines, etc. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated both at the level of health professionals and departments. DISCUSSION: Our objective is to demonstrate the effect of training all department staff with a Train-the-Trainer program supported by e-learning in the application of a new clinical guideline. The strengths of the study are the natural setting, the training of all staff, the random allocation of conditions, the large scale of the study, and the willingness of both staff and management to participate in the study.

1053,Improve the adequacy of the use of antimicrobials in primary care after the implementation of a local antimicrobial guide at both levels of care,"Objective This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple interventions carried out during the implementation of a guideline on improving the adequacy of antimicrobial prescription in primary care. Design This is a cross-sectional before/after study conducted in the Aljarafe Health Area (Andalusia, Spain), with a population of 368,728 inhabitants treated in 37 health centers. Subjects Subjects include patients with antibiotic prescription during 2009 (pre-intervention phase) or 2012 (post-intervention phase) selected by simple random sampling (confidence level, 95%; precision, 5%), with infections recorded in the electronic medical record. Interventions This study involves training sessions in primary care centers and hospital services, incorporation of the electronic guide of the Health Services Websites and incorporation of the Digital Health History guide as a decision-making support tool. Main outcome Difference in appropriate prescription of antibiotics before and after study interventions. Other variables also include age, gender, type of pharmacy, prescribed antibiotic, number of treatments per year, site of infection, and main comorbidities. Sources In addition, this study uses computerized pharmacy records of reimbursed and dispensed medications and electronic medical records. Results The percentage of adequate prescription of antibiotics is shown, which increased from 36% in 2009 to 57% in 2012 (p?<?0.001). The improvement was seen in patients of all ages and of any sex and was greater among patients of working age and patients with comorbidities. The best results were observed in the beta-lactam group and in the treatment of respiratory and skin infections. Conclusion Carrying out multifactorial interventions involving professionals from both levels of care could be an effective strategy to improve the use of antimicrobials in primary care.",0,1,
1054,Improving care of people with acute low back pain by allied health professionals (ALIGN trial): a cluster randomized trial protocol,"Background There is variability between clinical practice guideline recommendations and actual clinical practice in many areas of health care. A 2004 systematic review examining the effectiveness of guideline implementation interventions concluded that there was a lack of evidence to support decisions about effective interventions to promote guideline uptake. Furthermore, the review recommended the use of theory in the development of implementation interventions. In Australia (2003) a clinical practice guideline for the treatment of acute low back pain has been developed. Acute low back pain is a common condition, carries a high burden, and there is some indication of a gap between evidence and practice in the allied health setting. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention that, if effective, may be of benefit to patients with this condition. Objectives This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase the compliance of allied physicians (physiotherapists and chiropractors in Victoria, Australia) with a clinical practice guideline for acute non-specific low back pain (LBP), compared to providing doctors with a hard copy of the guide. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients with acute nonspecific low back pain who are referred or receive radiography, and to improve the mean level of disability for patients three months after disease onset. . acute low back pain. Methods The study design is a cluster randomized trial. Restricted randomisation was used to randomise 210 practices (groups) to an intervention or control group. Practitioners in the control group received a printed copy of the guideline. Practitioners in the intervention group received a theory-based intervention developed to address prospectively identified barriers to practitioner compliance with the guideline. The intervention consisted mainly of an educational symposium. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating physician for acute nonspecific low back pain of less than three months' duration during a two-week data collection period, three months after the intervention symposia, are eligible for inclusion. . Sample size calculations are based on recruiting between 15 and 40 patients per practice. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group assignment.",0,1,
1055,"Improving hypertension management in Kazakhstan: implications for improving clinical practice, patient behaviors, and health outcomes","This article presents the results of the evaluation of a strategy aimed at improving case detection and treatment of patients with hypertension. Study findings suggest that orienting providers to clinical guidelines, public information about hypertension risks, promotion of annual blood pressure screening, and universal access to an outpatient drug benefit package improve detection and case management. Additionally, provider training at the pilot sites resulted in a substantial and significant difference in patient care and health outcomes. Provider training and tools, especially focused on effective patient counseling, contributed significantly to increased case finding, patient adherence to prescribed medications, salt reduction, and increased regular exercise. However, further improvements are required to achieve the expected adherence of patients to medication and lifestyle advice. In the pilot area, we compared two patient samples before and after the start of the intervention. We found an increase in the proportion of patients with blood pressure ≥ 160/100 mmHg. The strategy involved the joint efforts of the Research Institute of Cardiology and Internal Diseases, the Karaganda Drug Information Center, the Karaganda Oblast Health Department, the Kazakh Association of Family Doctors, the Postgraduate Institute for Almaty and USAID's ZdravPlus Project in Central Asia.",0,0,
1056,Improving outcome of bipolar disorder through non-pharmacological strategies: the role of psychoeducation,"This article addresses the efficacy of psychoeducation and related strategies in bipolar disorders. Recently, several randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of psychological interventions, that is, identification of prodromal signs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and family-focused interventions, as a prophylactic adjunct to medication. All of these studies are presented here, along with pioneering studies in the field. There are several topics that every psychoeducational program must include to ensure its usefulness, and they are summarized in twelve points. Roughly, psychoeducation should contain general information about bipolar illness, elements of improving adherence, teaching about early recognition of relapse, and regular lifestyle issues. Today, various treatment guidelines include psychoeducation as a fundamental prophylactic tool. Clinicians must be aware of this and begin to carry out psychoeducation in their daily clinical practice.",0,0,
1057,Improving the success of mail letter intervention programs to influence prescribing behaviors: a review.,"BACKGROUND: Educational interventions have long been used as a means of influencing prescribing behaviour. Various techniques including educational mailings, academic details, prescriber feedback with or without disclosure of patient identification data, and supplemental patient information have been used to promote proper prescribing habits, reduce costs, and optimize patient care. While the effects of educational intervention programs are widely reported, little information is available on the effectiveness of various mail intervention techniques. OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of mail-in intervention programs and identify factors that may promote successful outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed for mail-in intervention program reports published through May 2012. Specific search terms included ""drug utilization review,"" ""drug utilization,"" ""Medicaid,"" ""prescription feedback"", ""mailed medical intervention"" and ""mailed medical communications"". Identified publications that met the following criteria were selected for inclusion: (a) evaluated print educational materials disseminated by mail, (b) occurred in an outpatient setting, and (c) measured the impact of the intervention on prescribing patterns , health care utilization, or the economy. results. Publications meeting all 3 criteria were summarized for intervention strategy, follow-up period, data source, intervention goal, prescriber acceptance of the intervention, and effect on prescribing patterns. health care utilization and economic outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 40 published reports on 39 single interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority (34/39 [87.2%]) of the studies were conducted in programs funded by the state or federal government; only 5 programs involved private insurers. All programs used follow-up periods of </=12 months after mailing of the final intervention. of 26 of the 39 single interventions reported a positive impact on at least 1 objective outcome. Programs that included a second recipient such as pharmacists (n = 4) reported greater impact compared to interventions mailed to prescribers only. Programs that provided patient care with identification data had a higher success rate than those that provided prescriber feedback and/or educational materials (21/25 [84.0%] vs. 5/14 [35.7%]); It should be noted that 2 of the 5 successful programs that provided Non-Patient-Identifying Materials also used academic details. Programs that sent educational material and/or prescriber feedback related to multiple drug classes or disease states had minimal impact on prescribing patterns (n = 4). However, targeting 1 specific ic disease or appropriate evidence-supported medication resulted in favorable change in a short period of time. Furthermore, providing recommendations supported by widely accepted clinical guidelines or literature was also associated with a high success rate. A subset of programs that sought to assess health care utilization (n = 5) and economic impact (n = 9) saw little change in measured outcomes. Evaluation of prescriber response forms by 7 programs revealed that changes in therapy occurred in approximately 50% of patients with prescribers who intended to accept intervention recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the degree of heterogeneity between articles prevents the provision of definitive results, it appears that a well-constructed mail intervention program has the potential to evoke significant changes in prescribing patterns. Prescribers appear to be receptive to mailed interventions; however, there are limited data to determine the association between acceptance and actual change in prescription. Future research should focus on identifying barriers that may prevent uptake of recommendations from translating into changes in therapy. projects should include longer evaluation periods to determine the duration of impact after the final intervention is delivered and the potential effect on health care and economic outcomes.",0,1,
1058,Improve use of early follow-up care after emergency department visits. A randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the appropriateness of parental use of early follow-up care after emergency department (ED) visits can be improved with post-visit support from a nurse practitioner. DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Setting: ED of an urban university hospital linked to the primary care center of the hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 190 children younger than 8 years who sought emergency department care for acute illnesses and who were treated as outpatients with follow-up in the primary care center at the discretion of emergency department physicians. INTERVENTION: Parents in the experimental group were called by a nurse practitioner who offered individualized guidance on follow-up and access to a nurse practitioner for further help as needed. The control group received ""usual"" follow-up advice during visits to the emergency department. MEASURES/MAIN RESULTS: In the week following emergency department visits, parents in the experimental group were more compliant with instructions related to follow-up than were parents in the control group (79% vs. 61%) , less likely to miss appointments (15% vs. 31%), and less likely to ""shop"" elsewhere for care (2% vs. 9%). The adequacy of follow-up was assessed 'blind' using pre-specified guidelines. Inappropriate use of follow-up care was significantly reduced among subjects in the experimental group (10% vs. 20%). CONCLUSION: The nurse practitioner intervention improved parental use of follow-up care in our sample. General care for episodic ED users could be improved with similar interventions.",0,0,
1059,In lukewarm defense of the population's health: doctors and antibiotic resistance,"Antibiotic resistance threatens the population as a serious public health threat and a costly social problem. Recent proposals to combat antibiotic resistance focus largely on supply-side approaches. Suggestions include gaming patent rights to give drug companies greater incentives to discover new antibiotics, as well as to resist overselling their new drugs already on the market. This article argues that an emphasis primarily on the supply side unfortunately diverts attention from the important demand-side influences of physicians. Physicians have a vital and inevitably necessary role to play in ensuring socially optimal access to antibiotics. Unfortunately, doctors' management of the antibiotic supply has been poor and their defense of the health of the population lukewarm at best. Acting as a prudent steward of the antibiotic supply often appears to be at odds with a physician's commonly understood fiduciary duties, ethical obligations, and professional standards, all of which traditionally emphasize the individual health paradigm as opposed to health responsibilities. of the population. Meanwhile, clinicians face limited incentives to conserve antibiotics from other sources, such as malpractice liability, regulatory standards, and reimbursement systems. While multifaceted efforts are needed to combat antibiotic resistance effectively, clinicians' vigilance behavior must become a priority area of attention. This article considers how health law and policy tools could favorably change the incentives physicians face to conserve antibiotics. A clear lesson from the managed care reform battles of the recent past is that interventions, to have the best chance of success, must respect the physician's interest in clinical autonomy and individualized medicine, even if, paradoxically, they vigorously promote the health prospects of the population. Furthermore, the legal and ethical obligations of physicians need to be reconceptualized in the context of antibiotics to better support policing in defense of population health. The main recommendation is greater use of financial incentives to reward physicians for adhering to recommended antibiotic prescribing guidelines. Although not a panacea, further experimentation with financial incentives may provide a much-needed boost to physician interest in antibiotic conservation and likely better address legitimate concerns of physician clinical autonomy.",0,0,

1061,Inclusion and exclusion criteria in randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy for PTSD,"OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and often disabling condition. Fortunately, there are effective psychological treatments for PTSD. However, research indicates that these treatments may be underused in clinical practice. One reason for this underuse may be the unwarranted exclusion of patients from these treatments by clinicians based on their understanding of the exclusion criteria used in clinical trials of psychological treatments for PTSD. There is no comprehensive and up-to-date review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of psychological treatments for PTSD. Therefore, we aimed to better understand how patients were excluded from such RCTs in order to provide guidance to clinicians regarding clinical populations likely to benefit from these treatments. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of RCTs of psychological treatments for PTSD from January 1, 1980, to April 1, 2012. We classified these clinical trials according to the types of psychotherapy discussed in the main guidelines for the treatment of PTSD. PTSD and we review all treatments. that were studied in at least two RCTs (N = 64 published studies with 75 intervention arms as some studies compared two or more interventions). We summarize and tabulate information on exclusion criteria for each type of PTSD psychotherapy. RESULTS: We identified multiple RCTs of cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 56), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (n = 11), and group psychotherapy (n = 8) for PTSD. The most common exclusions were psychosis, substance abuse and dependence, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation. Clinical trials varied in the severity with which these criteria were applied. It is important to note that no exclusion criteria were used in all studies and there was at least one study of each type of therapy that included patients from each of the commonly excluded groups. There is a paucity of evidence on the treatment of patients with PTSD and four co-morbidities: current alcohol and substance abuse or dependence, current psychosis, current mania, and current suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments for PTSD have been studied in large and representative clinical populations. It seems that more liberal use of these treatments is warranted regardless of comorbidities.",0,0,
1062,"INCOG Recommendations for the Management of Cognition After Traumatic Brain Injury, Part III: Executive Function and Self-Awareness","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces complex cognitive (and other) sequelae. Deficits in executive function and self-awareness are among the most characteristic neuropsychological sequelae and can have a profound effect on resumption of previous life roles. An international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) met to develop recommendations for interventions to improve deficits in executive functioning and self-awareness after TBI. METHODS: The team reviewed the available literature and ensured that the recommendations were up to date. To promote implementation, the team developed decision algorithms that incorporate recommendations based on inclusion and exclusion criteria from published trials. The team then prioritized recommendations for implementation and developed audit criteria to assess compliance with the best practice recommendations. RESULTS: Intervention programs that incorporate instruction in metacognitive strategies for planning, problem solving, and other cognitive-executive deficits have a strong evidence base. New evidence supports the use of strategies to specifically improve reasoning skills. There is substantial support for the use of direct corrective feedback to improve self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS: A growing number of scientifically well-designed studies are available demonstrating the effectiveness of a variety of interventions to remedy deficits in executive function and self-awareness after TBI.",0,0,
1063,Increased compliance with an antibiotic prophylaxis guideline to prevent pediatric surgical site infection: before and after study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an intervention to improve compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) guidelines to prevent surgical site infections in children. BACKGROUND: Although adequate BP reduces surgical site infection and guidelines improve quality of care, changing practice is difficult. To facilitate behavior change, several barriers need to be addressed. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force at a pediatric hospital developed an evidence-based AP guideline. Subsequently, the guideline was published in the operating rooms and the online form, only recommended antibiotics were available in the operating rooms, new interns received orientation, antibiotic verification was included in the waiting time, computerized alerts for postoperative prophylaxis were established inadequate and the surgeons received email. -mails when the guideline was not followed. The indication and administration of PA for surgical procedures was documented in July 2008 (pre-intervention), September 2011 (post-intervention) and April-May 2013 (follow-up). Compliance was defined as complete: appropriate antibiotic, dose, timing, redosing, and duration when prophylaxis was indicated; partial: appropriate drug and timing when prophylaxis was indicated; and appropriate use: complete compliance when prophylaxis was indicated, no antibiotics. when not indicated Pre-intervention and follow-up compliance was compared using chi-tests (2) RESULTS: PA was indicated in 43.9% (187/426) and 62.0% (124/200) of surgical procedures at pre-intervention and follow-up, respectively. There were significant improvements in appropriate use of antibiotics (51.6%-67.0%; P < 0.001), complete compliance (26.2%-53.2%; P <0.001) and partial (73.3%-88.7%, P = 0.001), correct dose (77.5%-90.7%; P = 0.003), time (83.3%-95.8% ; P = 0.001), redosing (62.5%-95.8%, P = 0.003), and duration (47.1%-65.3%);"" p < 0.002).

1064,Increased compliance to low tidal volume ventilation in the ICU with two stimulus-based interventions: assessment through intervention time series analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Low tidal volume ventilation (LVT) improves outcomes for ventilated patients, and most clinicians report implementing it. Unfortunately, most patients never receive low VTs. Nudges influence decision making with subtle cognitive mechanisms and are effective in many contexts. There have been few studies examining its impact on clinical decision making. We investigated the impact of 2 interventions designed using behavioral science principles on the deployment of low-eVT ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). SETTING: University Hospitals Bristol, a 20-bed mixed tertiary medical and surgical ICU, admitting more than 1,300 patients per year. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 2144 consecutive patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 1 hour between October 2010 and September 2014. Patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Default ventilator settings were adjusted to meet low TVe targets from the start of ventilation, unless actively changed by a clinician. (2) Implemented a large dashboard displaying TVs in ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW) format with alerts when TVs were excessive. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: TVe in mL/kg IBW. FINDINGS: TVe was significantly lower in the noncompliance group. In the scorecard intervention, TVe fell more rapidly and to a greater extent after a TVe of 8 mL/kg PCI was breached compared with controls. This effect improved in each subsequent year for 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that adjusting the ventilator default settings and an alert dashboard for excessive VTe can significantly influence clinical decision making. This offers a promising strategy for improving compliance with low TVe ventilation and suggests that the use of behavioral science insights has the potential to improve the translation of evidence into practice.",1,1,
1065,Increasing the quantity and quality of the search for the current best evidence to answer clinical questions: protocol and intervention design of the MacPLUS FS factorial randomized controlled trials,"Background and objectives Finding the current best evidence for clinical decisions remains a challenge. With 3,000 new studies published every day, no evidence-based resource provides all the answers or is sufficiently up-to-date. McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service - Federated Search (MacPLUS FS) solves this problem by searching multiple high-quality resources simultaneously and displaying the results in a one-page pyramid with the most clinically useful at the top. However, additional logistical and educational barriers need to be addressed to improve evidence retrieval at the point of care. This trial seeks to test three innovative interventions, among MacPLUS FS-registered clinicians, to increase the quantity and quality of the search for the best current evidence to answer clinical questions. Methods and design In a user-centered approach, we designed three interventions embedded in MacPLUS FS: (A) a web-based clinical question recorder""; (B) an evidence retrieval trainer comprised of eight short educational videos""; (C) an audit, feedback, and gamification approach to evidence retrieval, based on the assignment of ""badges"" and ""reputation scores."" We will conduct a randomized factorial controlled trial among the 904 eligible physicians currently registered with MacPLUS. FS at hospitals affiliated with McMaster University, Canada. Graduate students (n = 429) and faculty/clinical staff (n = 475) will be randomly assigned to each of the following three interventions in a factorial design (A x B x C). Utilization will be continuously recorded through clinician accounts that track logins and usage, down to the level of individual keystrokes. The primary outcome is the rate of searches per month per user during the six months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes, measured through the validated Impact Evaluation Method questionnaire, include: usefulness of the answers found (meeting the information needs of physicians), use (application in practice), and perceived usefulness in patient outcomes. .

1068,Individuals with low back pain: how do they see physical activity?,"BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for people with acute low back pain have recommended early resumption of normal activity and increased physical activity. Little is known about the relationship between low back pain and physical activity, and about the impact of that relationship in promoting higher levels of physical activity within a general practice population. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore associations between factors influencing changes in physical activity and how people perceive and behave with their low back pain, and the impact of those perceptions and behavior on physical activity. METHODS: Twenty-seven informants were chosen using a purposive sample from a larger group of people who, because of their low back problem, had been referred by their GPs to a community-based single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the University of York, which is evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a progressive exercise program. 54 interviews were conducted with this subgroup of the RCT"";"" four informants were interviewed once, 19 twice and four of them three times. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using manual and computer-assisted approaches. RESULTS: Physical activity was perceived as (i) activities of daily living, (ii) dyspnea-causing activities that deviated from doing, and (iii) more competitive-type activity. Avoidance of physical activity and fear of recurrence of pain were the two main factors directly associated with informants' back and changes in physical activity. These two factors hindered the increase in physical activity, although most informants strongly believed that physical activity helped relieve low back pain. CONCLUSIONS: When advocating that people with acute low back pain return to or increase physical activity, it is important for clinicians to identify physical activity avoidance and/or fear of pain at the earliest stage in order to tailor counseling and reassurance. properly. If activity avoidance and fear of pain are identified and clinicians want to encourage patients to engage in and maintain increased physical activity, they should explore issues of fear of pain and avoidance and confidence in doing physical activity, in addition to other factors that influence physical activity.",0,0,

1070,Infectious diseases in general practice and prescription of antibiotics. Observational study in Sicily,"Medicine utilization studies have shown wide differences, between different countries, in prescribing behavior in general practice. In Italy, for example, the choice of antibiotic prescription seems to show a broader use of the parental antibiotic. The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of antibiotic prescription and therapeutic doses used by Sicilian general practitioners (GPs) and to assess their prescribing attitudes regarding the use of parental ones. Each physician had to complete a questionnaire for each therapeutic intervention completed with antibiotic prescription during a period of 6 months. Diagnoses and drugs were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC), respectively. On 9,395 prescriptions made by 76 doctors in 25 Sicilian cities, the analysis indicated that acute respiratory symptoms represent the most common indication (31.7%) for a medical consultation, and that macrolides [such as azithromycin (8.8%) and clarithromycin (8.3%)], Penicillin [as amoxicillin (7.1%) and co-amoxiclav (8.4%)], III generation Cephalosporins [as cefixime (5.5%) and ceftriaxone ( 5.1%)] represent the most used therapeutic groups. The choice of route of administration was influenced by the age of the patients and, more significantly, by the symptoms and signs of the disease, rather than by the bacteria suspected of causing the disease. In conclusion, our data clearly indicate the lack of awareness of antibacterial therapy guidelines among Sicilian physicians, as well as the need for independent educational training to improve antibiotic knowledge and decrease the cost of health care.",0,0,
1071,Influence of patient requests for advertised direct-to-consumer antidepressants: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs in the United States is pervasive and controversial. Critics say it leads to overprescribing, while advocates counter that it helps prevent underuse of effective treatments, especially for underrecognized or stigmatized conditions. Objective To determine the effects of patients' DTC-related requests on clinicians' initial treatment decisions in patients with depressive symptoms. Design Randomized trial with standardized patients (SP). Six SP roles were created by crossing 2 conditions (major depression or adjustment disorder with depressed mood) with 3 request types (brand-specific, general, or none). Setting Primary care physician offices in Sacramento, California; San francisco California; and Rochester, NY, between May 2003 and May 2004. Participants One hundred fifty-two family physicians and general internists recruited from individual and group practices and health maintenance organizations;"" cooperation rates ranged from 53% to 61% Interventions HCPs were randomly assigned to 298 unannounced visits, with restricted assignments, whereby clinicians saw 1 HCP with major depression and 1 with adjustment disorder HCPs made a specific brand-name medication request, a general medication request or no request (control condition) in approximately one-third of visits Main outcome measures Data on prescribing, mental health referral, and primary care follow-up obtained from written SP reports, audio recordings of visits , chart review, and analysis of written prescriptions and drug samples The effects of type of request on the Prescriptions were assessed using contingency tables and confirmed in generalized linear mixed models accounting for clustering and adjusting for site, physician, and visit characteristics. Results Standardized patient role fidelity was excellent, and the rate of suspicion that physicians had seen a PS was 13%. In major depression, antidepressant prescription rates were 53%, 76%, and 31% for HCPs making brand-specific, general, and no-requests, respectively (p < 0.001). In adjustment disorder, antidepressant prescription rates were 55%, 39%, and 10%, respectively (p < 0.001). The results were confirmed in multivariate models. Minimally acceptable initial care (any combination of an antidepressant, mental health referral, or follow-up within 2 weeks) was offered to 98% of HCPs in the major depression role presenting a blanket request, 90% of those presenting a specific trademark request, and 56% of those who did not request it (p < 0.001). Conclusions Patient requests have a profound effect on prescribing in major depression and adjustment disorder. Direct-to-consumer advertising can have competitive effects on quality, potentially preventing underuse and promoting overuse.",0,0,
1072,Influence on lifestyle measures and five-year coronary risk by a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program in patients with coronary heart disease,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle measures for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) have been overshadowed by the efficacy of pharmacological treatments. This is particularly the case in the context of secondary prevention where the benefits of lipid-lowering, antiplatelet, and antihypertensive drugs have been emphasized in numerous trials. Lifestyle measures address several CHD risk factors at once and usually don't have serious side effects. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to determine whether a comprehensive lifestyle modification program could favorably influence dietary and exercise habits in addition to smoking cessation over two years. In addition, an attempt was made to assess whether this program could favorably influence the risk of CHD at five years in the male population included in the study. DESIGN: A total of 197 patients with proven coronary artery disease were enrolled and randomized to a lifestyle intervention program or usual care. Follow-up was after a period of two years. METHODS: The intervention comprised a low-fat diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, psychosocial support, and education, delivered by nurses, on the rationale for pharmacological and lifestyle measures. Usual care included routine outpatient follow-up. Both groups received the same comprehensive medication according to recent guidelines. RESULTS: Patients in the lifestyle intervention group reduced their intake of saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol (P<0.001), increased their level of exercise (P<0.01), and quit smoking (P<0.001). 05) compared to the usual care group. A subanalysis of the influence of the estimated 5-year CHD risk in men resulted in a relative risk reduction of 22% (95% confidence intervals 9-35). Although significant, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the low statistical power and reproducibility of the method. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of modern pharmacological treatments for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, it remains possible, through favorable diet, exercise, and smoking cessation, to show a further reduction in the 5-year risk of CHD in men.",0,0,

1074,Influencing antibiotic prescribing through prescriber feedback and management guidelines: a 5-year follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: The extent of antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) prompted a previous study of an educational intervention based on prescriber feedback and management guidelines. This study demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic prescription for URTIs and a more appropriate choice of antibiotics for tonsillitis/strep throat. There are few long-term follow-up studies of educational programs of this type. OBJECTIVES: This follow-up study aimed to examine whether the reduction in antibiotic prescribing seen in the original study's intervention group remained present after 5 years, and how the prescribing behavior of GPs involved in follow-up differed. of a large national group. medical prescription survey. METHODS: Attempts were made to contact all 157 GPs involved in the original study. Of these, 121 were located and currently working in general practice. Ninety-six agreed to participate, and of these, 79 completed a morbidity and treatment survey of 100 patient encounters (65.3% response rate). RESULTS: The intervention group (n = 37) maintained their pattern of antibiotic prescription for URTIs and choice of antibiotics for tonsillitis/strep throat, with no significant changes between completion of the original study and 5-year follow-up. The control group (n = 42) showed a downward trend in antibiotic prescription for URTIs, with the effect that no significant differences remained between groups at 5-year follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, both groups prescribed significantly fewer antibiotics for URTIs and showed greater adherence to prescribing guidelines for tonsillitis/strep throat than did participants in a large national survey of GPs (n = 984). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated maintenance of prescribing behavior in the intervention group over the long term. However, the changes in prescribing seen in the control group and the power limitations of the study make it unclear whether this was the result of a sustained effect of the educational intervention. Differences in both groups from the large national survey of GPs suggest that other prescribing influences (such as participation in professional training for general practice) were also having an important effect.",0,0,
1075,Influencing antibiotic prescribing in general practice: an essay of prescriber feedback and management guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: The extent of antibiotic use to treat upper respiratory tract infections in general practice is an area of concern due to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. Effective educational strategies are needed to promote rational prescribing. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the effectiveness of prescriber feedback and management guidelines in reducing antibiotic prescribing by trainee GPs for undifferentiated upper respiratory tract infection and in improving antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/strep throat. The research tested a stepwise approach to targeting educational information to the most frequent prescribers.

Trainees completed three practice activity surveys, each of 110 consecutive patient encounters, with 6-month intervals between surveys. Prescriber comments and management guidelines on antibiotic use for URTIs and antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/strep throat were provided in writing between surveys 1 and 2. A visit was conducted between surveys 2 and 3. educational to prescribers. Outcome measures were antibiotic prescription rate for all indications, for URTIs, and prescription of selected antibiotics for tonsillitis/strep throat. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescription by the intervention group decreased three times from 25.0 to 23.3 to 19.7 per 100 URTI problems, while the control group increased from 22.0 to 25.0 at 31.7 per 100 URTI problems (P = 0.002). Prescribing according to accepted guidelines for tonsillitis/strep throat increased over time in the intervention group from 55.6 to 69.8 to 73.0 per 100 problems, but decreased in the control group from 59.6 to 57.5 to 58.5 (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prescriber feedback and management guidelines have been shown to influence antibiotic prescription for URTIs and choice of antibiotics for tonsillitis/strep throat. This study provides a model for targeting educational information to those prescribers who most need to change their behavior.",0,0,
1076,Information technologies for patient safety,"Background Research on patient care has identified substantial variations in the quality and safety of medical care and considerable risks of iatrogenic harm as major problems. These failures contribute to the high rates of potentially avoidable morbidity and mortality and the rising levels of health care spending seen in many health systems. There have been substantial advances in information technology in recent decades and there is now real potential to apply these technological advances to improve the provision of healthcare universally. Of particular international interest is the use of eHealth applications. However, there is a large gap between the theoretical and empirically proven benefits of eHealth applications. While these apps often have the technical ability to assist professionals in the delivery of health care, inadequate attention to the sociotechnical dimensions of their use can lead to new avoidable risks for patients. Results and discussion Given the current lack of evidence on improvements in quality and safety and on the cost-benefits associated with the introduction of eHealth applications, there should be a focus on the implementation of more mature technologies"";"" It is also important that eHealth applications are assessed against a comprehensive and rigorous set of measures, ideally at all stages of their application lifecycle.",0,1,
1077,Informed consent in clinical research in a general hospital in Mexico: opinions of researchers,"In Mexico, informed consent is a legal requirement that ensures that patients who are invited to participate in clinical trials have all the information necessary to decide whether or not to participate in a research protocol. To improve our understanding of the problems physicians in developing countries face when obtaining informed consent (IC), we examined their opinion on the importance of IC in clinical research, the quantity and quality of information provided to the participant, and the conditions under which the IC is obtained. The researchers felt that the CI was useful to patients, providing information that helped the patient make a decision about participation. However, they felt that for some aspects of the research, such as drug development in general, the use of placebos, and the randomization process, many of the patients were not able to fully understand the information provided, referring to the complexity of the information and illiteracy as the main reason. Many researchers were unaware of some of the guidelines established in the General Health Law of Mexico,(1) 36% of them admitted not having completed their IC letters. Most investigators gave the patient only a few minutes to make a decision, and 20% of the IQs were obtained while the patient was hospitalized.

1078,Informed consent in human experimentation before the Nuremberg code,"The question of ethics regarding medical experimentation in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s was crucial in the Nuremberg trials and related trials of physicians and public health officials. Those involved in horrible crimes tried to excuse themselves by arguing that there were no explicit rules governing medical research on human beings in Germany during the period and that research practices in Germany were no different from those in allied countries. In this context, the 1947 Nuremberg code is generally considered to be the first document to establish ethical standards in human experimentation based on informed consent. However, new research indicates that the ethical issues of informed consent in guidelines for human experimentation were recognized as early as the 19th century. These guidelines shed light on the still controversial question of when the concepts of autonomy, informed consent, and therapeutic and non-therapeutic research first emerged. This topic assumes renewed importance in the context of current attempts to assess responsibility for the abuse of persons in various experiments conducted since World War II in the United States, Canada, Russia, and other nations.",0,0,
1079,Informed consent: coronary artery bypass graft,"Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a well-documented procedure. Despite the increased prevalence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), surgical revascularization will continue to play an important role in patients with coronary artery disease. As previous clinical studies have shown, clinicians can provide patients with important information about risk-adjusted outcomes. Various databases have been used to develop risk models to predict morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing CABG. Patients must choose between CABG and PCI based on the explanations of the doctors. Major trials have shown a marked survival benefit of CABG among those patients at high risk of death from the disease itself, defined by severity of angina, number of affected vessels, and left ventricular function. However, it is not clear that patients always receive the correct information about whether CABG or PCI is the most appropriate procedure.

1080,Informed shared decision making supported by decision advisors for women with ductal carcinoma in situ: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Women with breast cancer want to be involved in making treatment decisions. The guidelines have confirmed the right to shared and informed decision-making. However, previous research has shown that the implementation of shared and informed decision making is not optimal due to limited physician resources, power imbalances between patients and physicians, and lack of evidence-based patient information. We developed an informed shared decision-making program for women with primary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The program provides decision-making guidance to women by specialist nurses and aims to support participation in informed decision-making and choices. In this trial, the informed shared decision-making program in breast care settings will be evaluated. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare the informed shared decision making program with standard care. The program includes evidence-based patient decision support and training for physicians (2 hours) and oncology and breast care nurse practitioners (4 days) in shared and informed decision making. Sixteen certified breast care centers will be included, and 192 women with primary DCIS will be recruited. The primary outcome is the degree of patient participation in shared decision making as assessed by MAPPIN-Odyad (multifocal approach to 'sharing' in shared decision making: observer instrument dyad). Secondary endpoints include MAPPIN inventory submeasures (MAPPIN-Onurse, MAPPIN-Omedical, MAPPIN-Opatient, MAPPIN-Qnurse, MAPPIN-Qpatient, and MAPPIN-Qmedical), informed choice, decisional conflict, and duration of encounters . Preparation for decision making and the provision of evidence-based patient decision aids are expected to increase patients' involvement in decision making with informed choices and reduce decision conflicts and length of stay. meetings with the doctor. In addition, an evaluation of the accompaniment process will be carried out.

1081,Infrastructure for Quality Transformation: Measurement and Reporting in Veterans Administration Intensive Care Units,"Background The Veterans Health Administration (VA) intensive care units (ICUs) develop an infrastructure for quality improvement using information technology and leadership in recruitment. Methods Setting The participation of the 183 ICUs in the quality improvement program is required. The infrastructure includes measurement (electronic data mining, analytics), quarterly web-based reporting, and support for implementing evidence-based practices. Leaders prioritize actions based on quality improvement goals. The electronic extraction is manually validated against the medical record, selecting hospitals whose data elements and measures fall at the extremes (10th, 90th percentile). The results are represented in graphic, narrative and tabular reports compared by type and complexity of the ICU. Results The VA admits 103?689±1156 patients in the ICU/year. Variation in electronic business practices, data location, and the normal range of some laboratory tests affect data quality. A data management website captures data elements important to UCI performance that are not available electronically. A dashboard manages data overload (quarterly reports range from 106 to 299 pages). More than 85% of ICU directors and nursing managers review their reports. Leadership interest is maintained by including UCI goals in executive performance contracts, identifying local improvement opportunities with analytics software, and focused reviews. Conclusion Relevant lessons for non-VA institutions include: (1) the need for ongoing data validation, (2) the essential involvement of leadership at multiple levels, (3) the supplementation of electronic data when key elements are absent, (4) the usefulness of a good but not perfect electronic gauge to move practice while improving data elements, and (5) the value of a dashboard.",0,0,
1082,Start of quality improvement activities in mental health services,"In the realm of public sector mental health services, responsibility for quality has often been viewed as the responsibility of the individual physician. This presents a particular challenge in introducing an organization-wide quality improvement culture in this environment. The introduction of a systemic view of quality may be resisted by individual physicians reluctant to accept that some clinical autonomy must be subsumed within more standardized patterns of intervention and evaluation. Services must first address the issue of preparing physicians to adopt such a culture, which requires strong direction from the executive level. The area of newly diagnosed psychosis in a public sector mental health service was selected as a starting point to initiate the culture of quality improvement. The end result for the organization has been a positive commitment to improvement, but the journey was long and difficult. This document describes the beginning of this ultimately rewarding journey.",0,0,
1083,Innovative strategy to implement chronic heart failure guidelines among family physicians in different healthcare settings in Berlin,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve drug therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective pilot intervention study was conducted with a comparative cross-sectional analysis before and after the intervention. Usual pharmacotherapy was observed for 8 months in two different outpatient healthcare settings in Berlin [11 family physicians from individual GP practices (IGP) and 12 working in a medical care center (MCC)]. Health care centers provide a novel structure for outpatient care and have recently been introduced in Germany. The subsequent intervention involved implementation of heart failure guidelines via a computer-based reminder system, followed by a renewed cross-sectional observation of prescribing behavior over 1 year. Family physicians recruited patients, assessed the severity of congestive heart failure according to NYHA class, and referred patients for echocardiography. The study included 190 patients in the baseline phase and 209 in the intervention phase. Longitudinal follow-up was performed in 172 cases. Echocardiography was requested by 94.6% of the MCC physicians and 79.9% of the IGP. Undermedication was observed in both settings. Guideline-based beta-blocker therapy was prescribed for 46.3% of patients (44.8% of IGPs and 48.5% of MCC-GPs). The prescription improved by 12.3% after the intervention. There were marked deficiencies in the prescription of aldosterone antagonists (35%) for severe heart failure, which improved to 44.2% after the intervention. CONCLUSION: The problem of inadequate implementation of evidence-based therapy for congestive heart failure was partially overcome by the use of the reminder system, which provided participating physicians with brief guideline recommendations during the intervention phase.",0,0,

Objective To determine the effects of computerized physician orders compared with physician reminders on vaccination rates in hospitalized patients. Design, Setting, and Patients Randomized trial of 3777 general practice patients discharged from 1 of 6 study wards over a 14-month period (November 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999) comprised of 2 overlapping influenza seasons in an urban public university hospital. Interventions The hospital's computerized physician order entry system identified hospitalized patients eligible for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. For patients with standing orders, the system automatically produced vaccine orders addressed to nurses at the time of patient discharge. For patients with reminders, the computer system provided physicians with reminders that included vaccine orders during routine order entry sessions. Main outcome measure Vaccine administration. Results During the approximately 6-month influenza season, 50% of all hospitalized patients were identified as eligible for influenza vaccination. Twenty-two percent of patients hospitalized during the entire 14-month study period were eligible for pneumococcal vaccination. Patients with standing orders received an influenza vaccine much more often (42%) than those with reminders (30%) (p < 0.001). Patients with standing orders received a pneumococcal vaccine significantly more often (51%) than those with reminders (31%) (p < 0.001). Conclusions Computerized standing orders were more effective than computerized reminders in increasing administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Our findings suggest that computerized standing orders should be used more widely for this purpose.",1,1,

1086,Integrated guide on the care of familial hypercholesterolemia from the FH International Foundation,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a predominantly inherited disorder present from birth that markedly elevates plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and causes premature coronary heart disease. There are at least 20 million people with HF worldwide, but most go undetected and current treatment is often suboptimal. To address this important gap in coronary prevention, we present, from an international perspective, a consensus-based guideline on HF care. The guide was generated from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. The recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of HF in adults and children, and establish guidelines for clinical purposes. They also address best practices for cascading screening and risk notification and testing of families for FH, including the use of genetic testing. Treatment guidance is based on risk stratification, management of noncholesterol risk factors, and the safe and effective use of LDL cholesterol-lowering therapies. Recommendations on lipoprotein apheresis are given. The use of emerging therapies for HF is also heralded. This international guideline acknowledges gaps in evidence, but aims to make the best use of contemporary practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for HF care. Consequently, it should be used to inform clinical judgment and be tailored to local and country-specific health care needs and resources.",0,0,

Medical staff are critical role models for parents, and how they position babies in the hospital strongly influences parenting practices at home. The goals of this project were to increase the percentage of infants following safe sleep practices in the NICU prior to discharge and to determine whether improving adherence to these practices would influence parental behavior at home. METHODS: An algorithm detailing when to initiate safe sleep practices, a ""Back to Sleep"" crib card, educational programs for nurses and parents, a crib audit tool, and post-discharge telephone reminders were developed as improvement intervention strategies. of quality. RESULTS: NICU compliance with the supine position increased from 39% to 83% (P < 0.001), provision of a firm sleeping surface increased from 5% to 96% (P < 0.001), and removal of soft objects of bed improved from 45% to 75% (P = 0.001). Using a post-discharge telephone survey, parental compliance with safe sleep practices was found to improve from 23% to 82% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial interventions improved adherence to safe sleep practices in the NICU and at home.",0,1,
1089,Integration of addiction treatment in primary care using mobile health technology: protocol for an implementation research study,"Background Health care reform in the United States is encouraging Federally Qualified Health Centers and other primary care practices to integrate treatment for addiction and other behavioral health conditions into their practices. The potential of mobile health technologies to manage addiction and co-morbidities such as HIV in these settings is substantial but largely unproven. This document describes a protocol to evaluate the implementation of an integrated E-Health communication technology delivered via mobile phones, called Seva, in primary care settings. Seva is an evidence-based addiction treatment and recovery support system for patients and real-time case monitoring for clinicians. Methods/Design Our implementation strategy uses three models of organizational change: the program planning model to promote acceptance and sustainability, the NIATx quality improvement model to create a welcoming environment for change and research dissemination of Rogers Innovations, which makes it easy to adapt innovations to maximize their potential for adoption. We will implement Seva and conduct an intensive mixed-methods evaluation at three Federally Qualified Health Care Centers in the United States. Our non-concurrent multi-baseline design includes three periods Â¡Âª pre-test (ending in four months of preparation for deployment), active Seva deployment, and maintenance Â¡Âª with staggered deployment at six-month intervals across sites . The first site will serve as a pilot clinic. We will track the timing of intervention elements and assess study results within each dimension of the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Sustainability framework, including effects on clinicians, patients, and practices. Our mixed-methods approach will include both quantitative (eg, interrupted time-series analysis of treatment attendance, with clinics as the unit of analysis) and qualitative methods (eg, interviewing staff regarding adaptations to treatment). implementation protocol), and evaluation of implementation costs. Discussion If the implementation is successful, the field will have proven technology to help Federally Qualified Health Centers and affiliated organizations provide addiction treatment and recovery support, as well as a proven strategy for implementing the technology. Seva also has the potential to improve core elements of addiction treatment, such as the referral and treatment processes. A mobile addiction treatment technology and accompanying deployment model could provide a cost-effective means of improving the lives of patients with drug and alcohol problems.",0,0,
1090,Integration of evidence on patient preferences in health policy decisions: patient-VIP study protocol,"Background Despite a strong move towards active patient participation in health policy decisions, systematic and explicit consideration of this research evidence on patient preferences appears limited. In addition, little is known about the views of various stakeholders regarding the consideration of research evidence on patient preferences in health care policy decisions. This article describes the protocol for an exploratory study on integrating research on patient preferences into health policy decisions. The study questions: the extent to which research evidence on patient preferences is considered in current procedures for health policy decisions; stakeholder views on integrating this type of evidence into health policy decisions; and what could be a decision framework for integrating such research evidence into health care policy decisions. Methods/Design The study is divided into three sub-studies, predominantly using qualitative methods. The first sub-study is a scoping review in five European countries to investigate whether and how research findings on patient preferences are considered in current procedures for coverage decisions and clinical practice guideline development The second sub-study is a qualitative study to explore the views of stakeholders regarding the possibilities of integrating evidence on patient preferences into the healthcare decision-making process in the Netherlands The third sub-study is the development of a framework decision for research on patient preferences. The framework will consist of: a process description regarding the place of evidence on patient preferences in the decision-making process;"" and a taxonomy describing different terminologies and conceptualizations of Â¡Â®preferencesÂ¡Â¯ and a overview of existing methodologies for researching preferences The conceptual framework will be presented and discussed with experts Discussion This study will raise awareness of the existence and potential value of research evidence on patient preferences for policy decision making and provides information on methods for researching patient preferences and the barriers and facilitators to integrating such research into health care policy decisions The results of the study will be useful to researchers, guideline developers clinical practice, those responsible for health care policy medical tion and patient representatives.",0,0,
1091,Integrative medicine in residency education: skills development through online curriculum training,"INTRODUCTION: The Integrative Medicine in Residency (IMR) program, a 200-hour Internet-based collaborative educational initiative, has been implemented in 8 family medicine residency programs and has shown potential to serve as a national model for incorporating training in medicine Integrative/complementary/alternative medicine in postgraduate medical education. INTERVENTION: Curriculum content was designed based on a needs assessment and a set of competencies for postgraduate medical education developed following the Accreditation Council for Postgraduate Medical Education outcome project guidelines. Content was delivered through distributed online learning and included on-site activities. A modular format allowed for flexible implementation in different residence settings. EVALUATION: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE CURRICULUM, A MULTIMODAL EVALUATION WAS USED, INCLUDING: (1) resident evaluation of the curriculum; (2) assessment of residents' competencies through medical knowledge tests, self-assessment, direct observations, and reflections;"" and (3) residents' well-being and well-being through behavioral assessments. RESULTS: The Class of 2011 ( n = 61) had a high rate of completion of the curriculum in the first and second year (98.7% and 84.2%) and the course evaluations on the achievement of the objectives, the clinical utility and the functioning of technology were highly rated There was a statistically significant improvement in medical knowledge test scores for questions aligned with PGY-1 and PGY-2 course content CONCLUSIONS: The IMR program is a step forward in the national effort to make integrative medicine training available to clinicians on a large scale and is a success in terms of online education Evaluation suggests that this program is feasible to implement and ace ptable for residents despite the many pressures of residence.",0,0,
1092,Intensive research in the management of Hodgkin's disease,"Ninety-eight patients with clinically localized Hodgkin's disease underwent laparotomy and splenectomy to determine the extent of microscopic spread. In 68 patients, the procedure was performed for untreated disease apparently confined above the diaphragm. Abdominal disease cannot be confidently excluded on the basis of a noninvasive investigation at presentation. Clinical evaluation of splenic disease was unreliable unless gross splenomegaly was present. Foot lymphography was accurate in evaluating para-aortic and iliac disease but was of no value in evaluating other intra-abdominal lymph node involvement, including mesenteric lymph node involvement. Trephine bone marrow biopsy findings were normal in all patients before surgery, and only one patient was found to have diseased bone marrow by Stryker saw biopsy at operation. Liver disease was identified at operation in nine patients, some of whom were asymptomatic with clinically undetectable splenic and nodal disease. Detailed clinical staging failed to detect disease in a third of patients who underwent laparotomy. These studies show that if radiation therapy remains the treatment of choice for truly localized lymph node disease, a detailed staging procedure, including laparotomy and splenectomy, remains essential. The value of this potentially curative treatment is greatly diminished in the patient who has not been adequately staged.",0,0,

1094,Intentions and prescription of statins: can the theory of planned behavior explain the behavior of the doctor in following the recommendations of the guidelines?,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have evaluated the usefulness of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain the behavior of physicians. This study uses TPB to explain clinicians' implementation of guideline prescribing recommendations. METHODS: We developed the questionnaire by conducting qualitative interviews and a pilot study. A random sample of 155 general practitioners (GPs) in England participated in the study. Prescription and practice data were collected from routine sources. We analyze the data using regression methods. RESULTS: TPB explained 48% of the variation in reported intentions to follow guideline prescription recommendations. Perceived attitude and controls, but not subjective norms, were predictors of variation in intentions. The TPB belief variables significantly explained the variation in the effective and efficient prescription indicators (14% and 12%, respectively). Normative, control, and behavioral beliefs contributed to the models. Only for efficient prescription, the TPB items maintained their meaning in the presence of demographic variables. We did not find a significant relationship between intention and prescription. CONCLUSIONS: TPB helped to understand the prescribing behavior of GPs and their intentions to implement a clinical guideline. Beliefs (eg, normative beliefs) were better predictors of behavior than composite scores for their corresponding higher-level construct (eg, indirect subjective norm). TPB models need to be tested in conjunction with randomized trials to test the causality assumption that change in beliefs ultimately results in change in behavior.",0,0,
1095,Interactions between pharmaceutical representatives and doctors in training. A thematic review,"OBJECTIVE: Medical school and residency are formative years in establishing prescribing patterns. Our aim was to review the literature on the degree of pharmaceutical industry contact with trainees, attitudes about these interactions, and the effects on trainees' prescribing behavior, with an emphasis on points of possible intervention and policy formation. DESIGN: MEDLINE was searched from 1966 to May 2004 for articles in English. All original articles were included if the abstract reported content relevant to medical education and the pharmaceutical industry. Editorials, guidelines, and policy recommendations were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Contact with pharmaceutical representatives was common among residents. Most of the participants felt that the interactions were appropriate. A minority felt that their own prescription might be influenced by contact or gifts, but were more likely to believe that others' prescription might be influenced. Resident prescribing was associated with pharmacist representative visits and sample availability. A variety of educational policies and interventions appear to influence residents' attitudes toward interactions with industry, although data on the long-term effects of these interventions are limited. In general, residents reported insufficient training in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical industry has a significant presence during residency training, has gained general acceptance from students, and appears to influence prescribing behavior. Training programs can benefit from policies and curricula that teach residents about the influence of industry and ways to critically evaluate the information provided to them. Recommendations for local and national approaches are discussed.",0,0,
1096,Interactions between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry: what does the literature say?,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of three types of interaction between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry (company-sponsored clinical trials, company-sponsored continuing medical education (CME), and information for physicians provided by pharmaceutical retailers) on the orientation and quality of clinical care. essays, the content of CME courses and the prescribing behavior of physicians. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and HEALTH search for articles in English published between 1978 and 1993, supplemented by material from the author's personal collection. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 227 articles from the MEDLINE and HEALTH searches and over 2000 articles from the author's library were initially reviewed. The following selection criteria were used: studies conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States""; studies conducted after 1977; quantitative surveys containing details of survey methods; studies on orientation and quality of clinical trials financed by companies and on the content of CME courses giving explicit criteria used in the evaluation;"" and reports on the outcome of the interactions indicating how the results were evaluated. Thirty-six studies met these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was extracted on five topics: Physicians' attitudes toward pharmaceutical industry interactions, Frequency with which physicians participate in interactions, Guidance and quality of company-funded clinical trials, Course content company-sponsored CMEs and physician prescribing changes. behavior as a result of an interaction. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although most physicians participate only occasionally in company-sponsored clinical trials, most see retailers and attend company-sponsored CME courses. However, physicians do not have a very high opinion of information from retailers or company-sponsored CME events. Many doctors consider pharmaceutical companies to be an important source of funding for clinical trials, but are also concerned about accepting money from this source. Corporate funding of clinical trials can affect the quality of trials and the types of research that doctors do. Company-sponsored CME courses can have a commercial bias, even if they are conducted under guidelines designed to ensure the independence of the event. All three types of interactions affect physicians' prescribing behavior and, in the case of obtaining information from retailers, physicians' prescribing practices are less appropriate as a result of the interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are affected by their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. More research is needed in most cases to determine whether such interactions lead to more or less appropriate prescribing practices. The CMA guidelines on this topic need to be evaluated to see if they are effective in controlling medical-industry interactions. Additional measures may be necessary if the guidelines fail to prevent negative effects on prescribing practices.",0,0,
1097,Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Managing the Fussy Baby: Key Strategies to Improve Outcomes,"The objectives of this study were to analyze the perspectives of key informants with clinical experience caring for unstable infants in the first months of life and their families, on the changes needed to improve outcomes. The research used an intentional selection strategy and thematic analysis of key informant interviews with 24 health professionals from 11 disciplines. Informants were selected for their extensive experience in managing fussy infants and their families. Participants corroborated existing evidence that postpartum care in Australia is fragmented. All held the view that first, early primary care intervention for fussy babies and their families, and second, improved interprofessional communication are vital if the burden of this problem on the baby is to be minimized. , the family and the health system. Third, there was consensus that there are significant gaps in the knowledge base and management behaviors of health professionals. The development of educational resources, best practice guidelines, shared assessment frameworks for primary care physicians, and strategies to improve communication between professionals are necessary to improve health outcomes and decrease the burden of this common but complex postpartum problem.",0,0,
1098,Internal and external validity of cluster randomized trials: systematic review of recent trials,"OBJECTIVES To assess aspects of the internal validity of recently published cluster randomized trials and to explore the reporting of information useful in assessing the external validity of these trials. DESIGN Review of 34 cluster randomized trials in primary care published in 2004 and 2005 in seven journals (British Medical Journal, British Journal of General Practice, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics). DATA SOURCES National Library of Medicine (Medline) via PubMed. DATA EXTRACTION To assess aspects of internal validity, we extracted data on the adequacy of sample size calculations and analyses, methods of identifying and recruiting individual participants, and blinding. To explore the reporting of useful information to assess external validity, we extracted data on group eligibility, group inclusion and retention, group generalizability, and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to health providers in the groups. RESULTS Twenty-one (62%) trials accounted for pooling in sample size calculations and 30 (88%) in analysis ""approximately a quarter were potentially biased due to procedures related to patient recruitment and identification"" ; individual participants were blinded to allocation status in 19 (56%) and outcome assessors were blinded in 15 (44%). In almost half of the reports, information related to the generalisability of the groups was poorly reported, and in two-fifths there was no information on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Cluster randomized trials are essential for evaluating certain types of interventions. Issues affecting its internal validity, such as appropriate sample size calculations and analyses, have become widely publicized and are now better addressed by researchers. Blinding of those identifying and recruiting patients to allocation status is recommended but not always carried out. There may be fewer barriers to internal validity in trials where individual participants are not recruited. External validity seems poorly addressed in many trials, but is arguably as important as internal validity in judging quality as a basis for health care intervention.",0,0,
1099,Recommendations of the International Collegium of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA) for the construction of multilingual speech tests. ICRA Task Force on Multilingual Speech Testing,"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for the development of two types of closed-set speech perception tests that can be applied and interpreted in the same way in all languages. The guidelines cover the digit triplet and matrix sentence tests that are most commonly used to assess speech recognition in noise. They were developed by a working group on Multilingual Speech Testing of the International College of Rehabilitation Audiology (ICRA). DESIGN: Recommendations are based on reviews of existing evaluations of the digit matrix and triplet tests, as well as the research experience of members of the ICRA Task Force. They represent the results of a consensus process. RESULTS: The resulting recommendations deal with: Test design and word selection""; Speaker characteristics; Audio recording and stimulus preparation; Masking noise; Test administration""; and test validation. CONCLUSIONS: By following these guidelines for the development of any new such tests, clinicians and researchers working in any language will be able to perform tests whose results can be compared and combined in cross-language studies.",0,0,
1100,Intervening in childhood: implications for autism spectrum disorders,"There is a dearth of empirically validated treatments for infants and toddlers under 3 years of age with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as a dearth of empirical research on successful intervention features for this population. However, early detection efforts are focused on identifying the risk of autism in children under 3 years of age. In order to build ASD interventions for infants and toddlers on a foundation of evidence-based features, the current article presents the results of a systematic literature search and effect size analysis of effective interventions for infants and toddlers with Other Developmental Disorders: Those who were born prematurely, have developmental disabilities, or are at high risk for developmental disabilities due to the presence of a biological or familial condition associated with developmental disabilities. A review of 32 high-quality, controlled experimental studies found that the most effective interventions routinely used a combination of four specific intervention procedures, including (1) parent involvement in the intervention, including ongoing parent training parenting that focused on both parent responsiveness and sensitivity to the key child and teaching families to deliver interventions to infants, (2) individualization based on each infant's developmental profile, (3) focus on a wide range of learning goals rather than a narrow one, and (4) temporal features that involve starting as soon as risk is detected and providing greater intensity and duration of intervention. These four characteristics of effective interventions for infants and toddlers with other developmental challenges likely represent a strong foundation from which researchers and clinicians can build effective interventions for infants and toddlers at risk for or affected by ASD.",0,0,
1101,Development of interventions for the integration of conventional smoking cessation interventions in the routine practice of CAM,"BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners are a significant and growing presence in health care systems around the world. A central question is whether evidence-based behavior change interventions routinely employed in conventional medical care could also be integrated into CAM practice to address public health priorities. Essential to successful integration are intervention approaches that are considered acceptable and consistent with the practice patterns and treatment approaches of different types of CAM practitioners, that is, that have context validity. The development of interventions to ensure context validity was an integral part of the CAM Reach Project (CAMR), a project examining the public health potential of smoking cessation training for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists (CAM practitioners). This article describes the formative research conducted to achieve this goal. METHODS: The development of the intervention, carried out in three CAM disciplines (chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy), consisted of six iterative steps: 1) exploratory interviews with key informants; 2) survey of the local community of CAM practitioners; 3) Demonstration of existing CAM cessation curriculum 4) Adaptation/adaptation of existing curriculum; 5) external review of adaptations; 6) delivery of a personalized curriculum to CAM professionals with follow-up evaluation of the curriculum. RESULTS: CAM professionals identified barriers and facilitators to address tobacco use with patients/clients and saw the relevance and acceptability of the content of the intervention . The intervention development process was attentive to your real-world intervention concerns. An extensive intervention tailored to the context of each CAM discipline was considered unnecessary. Participants and advisors from all CAM disciplines embraced the training content, considering it to have broad relevance and application across the three CAM disciplines. All findings informed the final intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The participatory and iterative formative research process yielded a context-valid intervention in real-world CAM practices as it: 1) is patient/client-centered, emphasizing the physician's role in a healing relationship; 2) responds to the different work contexts of CAM physicians and patient/client relationships; 3) integrates relevant best practices from the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Treatment of Tobacco Dependence; and 4) accommodates the variety of healing philosophies, scopes of practice, and practice patterns found in participating CAM practitioners. The full CAMR study to assess the impact of the CAMR intervention on the clinical behavior of CAM practitioners is underway.",0,0,
1102,Intervention for autism spectrum disorders,"comprehensive approach to the evaluation of any child with autism must be specifically tailored to each individual child and family. This premise is valid for medical therapies and special education services, as well as for psychopharmacological interventions. Behavioral, as opposed to pharmacological, treatment is the hallmark of an effective intervention for autism. Physicians involved in the care of children with autism should be familiar with educational law and intervention recommendations. Goals should include improved verbal and nonverbal functional communication and social skills, increased participation in developmentally appropriate activities, improved gross and fine motor skills, and the development of independent academic and organizational skills, as well as replacement of problem behaviors. with developmentally appropriate behaviors. Medicating children with autism is difficult, but is often necessary for chronic behavioral difficulties. In the absence of clear and current guidelines, we have tried to use the evidence and clinical experience to suggest an algorithm based on groups of symptoms. Although children with autism may respond to lower-dose medications and be more susceptible to side effects than other children, medical intervention can produce a significant improvement in quality of life for the child and family. Careful thought leading to the correct identification of target behaviors can appropriately direct better alternatives to medication. Although these approaches are costly and time-consuming endeavors, the expenditure of such efforts is the only path available to improve potential outcomes for people with autism, as well as lower the lifetime societal costs for each individual.",0,0,
1103,Mapping of interventions for the development of a strategy to implement insurance medication guidelines for depression,"BACKGROUND: This article describes the development of a strategy to implement insurance medication guidelines for depression. The use of the guidelines is intended to result in a more transparent and consistent assessment of applicants with depressive symptoms. METHODS: The implementation strategy was developed using the Intervention Mapping (IM) method for alignment with insurance medical practice. The ASE behavioral explanation model (Attitude, Social Influence and Self-Efficacy) was used as a theoretical basis for the development of the work. A literature review of implementation strategies and interviews with insurance physicians were conducted to develop instruments for use with the guideline. These instruments were designed to meet the needs and working circumstances of insurance physicians. Performance indicators were defined to measure the quality of the assessment and adherence to guidelines with input from insurance physicians. RESULTS: This study resulted in the development of a training course to teach insurance physicians how to apply the guidelines for depression, using the aforementioned instruments. The effectiveness of this training course will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IM allowed the development of guideline support instruments adapted to insurance medical practice.",0,0,
1104,Interventions delivered by health professionals providing routine child health care to reduce tobacco smoke exposure in children: a review and meta-analysis,"IMPORTANCE: Reducing children's exposure to tobacco smoke is a public health priority. The guidelines recommend that health professionals in child health settings should address tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of interventions delivered by health professionals providing routine child health care in reducing TSEs in children. DATA SOURCES: A secondary analysis of 57 trials included in a 2014 Cochrane review and a subsequent extended search was performed. Controlled trials (published up to June 2015) of interventions that focused on reducing childhood TSE were identified, with no restrictions on who delivered the interventions. Secondary data extraction was performed in August 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled trials of routine child health care provided by health professionals (physicians, nurses, physician assistants, health educators, and dieticians) that addressed the outcomes of interest. (reducing ERT in children and parental smoking behaviors) were eligible for inclusion in this review and meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two authors independently extracted study details and quality characteristics. If the outcome measures were sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Otherwise, the results were described narratively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the reduction of TSEs in children. Secondary outcomes of interest were parental smoking cessation, reduction in parental smoking, and prevention of postpartum maternal smoking relapse. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the selection criteria. Narrative analysis of the 6 trials that measured TSEs in children indicated no intervention effects relative to comparison groups. Similarly, meta-analysis of 9 trials measuring parental smoking cessation demonstrated no overall effect of the intervention (n = 6,399) (relative risk, 1.05""; 95% CI, 0.74- 1.50, P = 0.78).Meta-analysis of the 3 trials that measured maternal postpartum smoking relapse prevention demonstrated a significant overall effect of the intervention (n = 1293) (hazard ratio 1.53, CI 95%, 1.10-2.14, P = 0.01) High levels of study heterogeneity were likely due to variability in outcome measures, duration of follow-up, intervention strategies, and unknown fidelity CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Interventions delivered by health professionals providing routine child health care may be effective in preventing maternal relapse to smoking.Further research is required to improve the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing go TSEs in children and increase smoking cessation by parents. The findings of this meta-analysis have policy and practice implications related to routine pediatric health professional interventions that aim to reduce children's exposure to tobacco smoke.",0,0,
1105,Interventions for adolescent depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents is underrecognized and undertreated despite its poor long-term outcomes, including suicide risk. Primary care settings may be critical places for depression identification, but there is little information on the usefulness of primary care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to review the evidence for the treatment of depression in primary care settings, focusing on evidence related to psychosocial, educational, and/or supportive intervention strategies. METHODS: Available data on brief psychosocial treatments for adolescent depression in primary settings were reviewed. Given the paucity of direct studies, we also drew on the related literature to summarize the available evidence on whether brief psychosocial support from a member of the primary care team, with or without medication, could improve depression outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 37 studies relevant to the treatment of adolescent depression in primary care settings. Only 4 studies directly examined the impact of psychosocial interventions provided by primary care for adolescent depression, but they suggest that such interventions may be effective. Indirect evidence from other psychosocial/behavioral interventions, including anticipatory counseling and efforts to improve adherence to treatment, and studies of depression in adults also show benefits of interventions delivered by primary care, as well as the impact of Provider training to improve psychosocial skills. CONCLUSIONS: Potential exists for successful treatment of adolescent depression in primary care, in view of evidence that brief psychosocial support, with or without medication, has been shown to improve a range of outcomes, including adolescent depression itself. . Given the great public health problem posed by adolescent depression, the likelihood that most depressed adolescents do not receive specialized services, and new guidelines for the management of adolescent depression in primary care, clinicians may find it useful to initiate of supportive interventions in their primary care practices.",0,0,
1106,Interventions for implementing thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that the use of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients at risk of VTE is safe, effective and cost-effective. Despite this, prophylactic therapies for VTE are underused. System-wide interventions may be more effective in improving VTE prophylaxis use than relying on the prescribing behaviors of individual providers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions designed to increase the implementation of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), assessed in terms of: 1. Increased proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis and prophylaxis adequate 2. Reduced risk of symptomatic VTE3. Reduced risk of asymptomatic VTE4. Safety of the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: The Trials Search Coordinator of the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group searched the Group's Specialized Register (last searched July 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL , The Cochrane Library) 2010, Issue 3. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases (April 19, 2010), as well as the reference lists of relevant review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All studies whose interventions aimed to increase the use of prophylaxis or adequate prophylaxis, decrease the proportion of symptomatic VTE, or decrease the proportion of asymptomatic VTE in hospitalized adult patients were included. Studies that simply distributed published guidelines and studies whose interventions were not clearly described were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected the following outcomes: the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis (PR), the proportion of patients receiving adequate prophylaxis (PAR) (primary outcomes), and the occurrence of symptomatic VTE, asymptomatic VTE, and safety outcomes as bleeding. We classify interventions into education, alerts, and multifaceted interventions. We meta-analysed RCTs and nonrandomized studies (NRS) separately using random-effects meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic and subgroup analyses. Before analysis, we decided that results would be pooled if three or more studies were available for a particular intervention. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and a cumulative meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 55 studies were included. One of these reported data in patient-days and could not be quantitatively analyzed with the others. The remaining 54 studies (8 RCTs and 46 NRS) eligible for inclusion in our quantitative synthesis recruited a total of 78,343 participants. Among the RCTs, there were insufficient data to pool the results for one primary outcome (prophylaxis received) for the 'alertness' intervention. Alerts, such as computerized reminders or stickers on patient charts, were associated with a risk difference (RD) of 13%, meaning an increase in the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis (95% confidence interval (CI ) 1% to 25% ). Among the NRS, there were insufficient data to pool both primary outcomes for each type of intervention. The pooled risk differences for received prophylaxis ranged from 8% to 17%, and for received adequate prophylaxis ranged from 11% to 19%. Education and alerts were associated with statistically significant increases in prescribing adequate prophylaxis, and multifaceted interventions were associated with statistically significant increases in prescribing any prophylaxis and adequate prophylaxis. Multifaceted interventions had the largest pooled effects. The I(2) results showed substantial statistical heterogeneity that is explained in part by the types of patients and the type of hospital. A subgroup analysis showed that multifaceted interventions that included an alert may be more effective in improving rates of prophylaxis and adequate prophylaxis than those without an alert. The VTE and safety results did not show significant benefit or harm, although most studies were underpowered to assess these results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A large number of studies were reviewed that implemented a variety of system-wide strategies aimed at improving rates of thromboprophylaxis in many settings and patient populations. Statistically significant improvements were found in prescribing prophylaxis associated with alerts (RCTs) and multifaceted interventions (RCTs and NRS), and improvements in prescribing appropriate prophylaxis in NRS with the use of education, alerts, and multifaceted interventions. Multifaceted interventions with an alert component may be the most effective. Demonstrated sources of heterogeneity included patient types and hospital type. The results of our review will help doctors, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administrators, and policymakers make practical decisions about adopting specific local, system-wide measures to improve prevention of VTE, a major public health issue. We found no significant benefit for VTE outcomes"";"" however, previous RCTs evaluating the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis that were powered to address these outcomes demonstrated the benefit of prophylactic therapies and a favorable balance of benefit against increased risk of bleeding events.",0,1,
1107,Interventions to improve patients' trust in physicians and physician groups,"BACKGROUND: Trust is a critical component of the doctor-patient relationship and is associated with increased satisfaction, treatment adherence, and continuity of care. It is unclear whether there are interventions known to be effective in improving patients' trust in doctors. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions aimed at improving a patient's trust in the doctor or in a group of doctors. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to week 4 2003), EMBASE (1985 to July 2003), Health Star (1975 to July 2004) , PsycINFO (1967 to July 2004), CINAHL (1982 to June 2003), LILACS (1982 to April 2003), African Trials Register (1948 to April 2003), African Health Anthology (1924 to April 2003), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to April 2003) and bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion. Bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion were also searched and investigators active in the field contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies of interventions (informational, educational, behavioral, organizational) directed at clinicians or patients (or caregivers) where the confidence was assessed as a primary or secondary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs, all published in English and set in North American primary care, involving 1916 participants, were included. There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of the objectives, format and content of the interventions. A trial of a training intervention for family doctors to improve communication behaviors (20 doctors assessed by 414 patients) showed no effect on trust. The other two interventions focused on the patient. One explored the impact on trust of disclosing medical incentives to patients (n=918) in a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and showed no decrease in trust. Another investigated the effect of induction visits on the confidence of new HMO members (n=564) in their HMO physicians. Confidence in physicians increased compared to control after visit for one type of induction visit, group visit (Confidence of 10 (SD)) was 8.8 (1.5) and 7.1 (2.2), difference 1.7, (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 2.18)). However, there were many dropouts and the analysis was not based on intention to treat. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is still insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention can increase or decrease trust in doctors. Further trials are required to explore the impact of policy changes, guidelines and specific training of clinicians on patient trust.",0,0,
1108,Interventions for migraine prophylaxis: protocol of an overview systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple interventions are effective for migraine prophylaxis. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarize the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attack. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct an overview systematic review to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for guideline-recommended interventions for migraine prophylaxis. A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews will be performed, which will be screened for RCTs. We will describe the general information of the RCTs for participants, interventions, outcome measures, comparisons and primary outcomes. In addition, a network meta-analysis will be performed to determine the comparative effectiveness of treatments using a random effects model. The absolute and relative efficacy of the treatments will be provided. Heterogeneity and inconsistency between trials will be assessed using the I(2) test statistic and Cochrane's Q test. Risk of bias will be assessed and the overall strength of evidence will be summarized. DISCUSSION: The result of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence of treatments for migraine prophylaxis and may provide a treatment ranking for patients and clinicians to help them select the best option.

1110,Interventions to change the behaviors of maternity health professionals to promote weight-related support for obese pregnant women: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a rapid increase in the publication of guidelines for managing obesity and weight gain during pregnancy over the last five years. Health professionals have identified multiple barriers to this area of practice, including the need to improve their communication skills, the belief that pregnant women will have negative reactions to weight-related discussions, and a lack of knowledge about weight management. Of weight. This systematic review aimed to identify: the effectiveness of interventions to change the practice of health professionals in relation to maternal obesity or weight control during pregnancy"";"" and what behavior change techniques and intervention delivery modes have been used in interventions to date. FINDINGS: The search strategy included searching electronic databases, trial registries, and citation searching. Inclusion criteria were intervention studies aimed at changing the practice of health professionals in relation to maternal obesity or weight control. The searches identified 3608 studies. However, no eligible completed studies were identified. One registered Canadian randomized controlled trial was identified. The trial includes a training intervention for family doctors with the aim of supporting adherence to weight gain guidelines during pregnancy. The trial had not yet started, so no effectiveness data were available. CONCLUSIONS: The current focus of research on maternal obesity and weight control is directed at changing the behaviors of pregnant women. These interventions do not address the multiple barriers of health professionals to the practice of maternal obesity and weight control. Further research is required to identify the most effective approaches to help health professionals implement maternal obesity and weight management guidelines in practice.",0,0,
1111,Interventions to improve follow-up of abnormal findings in cancer detection,"The potential reduction in morbidity and mortality through cancer screening cannot be achieved without receiving adequate follow-up care for abnormalities identified through screening. In this article, the authors critically review the existing literature on the correlates of receiving adequate follow-up care for abnormalities detected by screening, as well as the literature on interventions designed to increase rates of receiving follow-up care. Lessons learned describe what is known and not known about factors that are related to or predict receipt of follow-up care. Similarly, effective interventions to increase follow-up are described and gaps identified. A conceptual model is developed that categorizes the health care system in the United States into four levels: policy, practice, provider, and patient. Some patient-level factors influencing receipt of follow-up are identified, but lack of data severely limits understanding of provider-, practice-, and policy-level correlates. Most intervention studies to increase uptake of follow-up have focused on patient-level factors and focused on follow-up of abnormal Pap smears. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of interventions at the provider, practice, or policy level. Standard definitions of what constitutes appropriate follow-up are lacking, severely limiting the comparability of findings across studies. The validity of various methods for obtaining outcome data has not been clearly established. More research is needed on interventions targeting factors at the provider, system, and policy levels, particularly interventions that focus on monitoring breast and colorectal abnormalities. Standardization of definitions and measures is needed to facilitate comparisons between studies. Cancer 2004. Published in 2004 by the American Cancer Society.",0,1,
1112,Interventions to improve hospital patient satisfaction with health care providers and systems: a systematic review,"Background Many hospital systems seek to improve patient satisfaction as assessed by the Hospital Consumer Health Care Systems and Provider Assessment (HCAHPS) surveys. A systematic review of current experimental evidence could inform these efforts and does not yet exist. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching electronic databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, the six Cochrane Library databases, and gray literature databases. We included studies that included hospital patients with interventions targeting at least 1 of the 11 HCAHPS domains, and that met our quality filter score on the 27-item Downs and Black coding scale. Post hoc power was calculated where appropriate. Results A total of 59 studies met the inclusion criteria, of these 44 did not meet the 50% quality filter (mean quality rating 27.8% ± 10.9%). Of the 15 studies that met the quality filter (mean quality rating 67.3% ± 10.7%), 8 focused on the HCAHPS Communication with Physicians domain, 6 focused on overall hospital rating, 5 focused on communication with nurses, 5 focused on pain management, 5 focused on communication about Medications, 5 aimed at Recommending the Hospital, 3 aimed at Calmness of the Hospital Environment, 3 aimed at Cleanliness of the Hospital Environment and 3 addressed to Registration Information. Eight interventions reported significant improvements from the HCAHPS, but their generalizability may be limited by narrowly focused patient populations, heterogeneity of approach, and other methodological concerns. Conclusions Although there are a few studies showing some improvement in the HCAHPS score across various interventions, we conclude that more rigorous research is needed to identify effective and generalizable interventions to improve patient satisfaction.",0,0,
1113,Interventions to increase the use of electronic health information by health professionals to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes,"BACKGROUND: A large volume of health information is available and, if applied in clinical practice, can contribute to effective patient care. Despite the abundance of information, suboptimal care is common. Many factors influence the use of health information by professionals, and the format (electronic or other) may be one of those factors. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions aimed at improving or increasing the use of electronic health information (EHI) by healthcare professionals on professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library (Wiley), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LISA (EBSCO) up to November 2013. We contacted researchers in the field and scanned reference lists. of relevant articles. . SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies that evaluated the effects of interventions to improve or increase the use of HIE by health professionals on professional practice and patient outcomes were included. We define EHI as information accessed on a computer. We define 'use' as logging into EHI. Any health professional involved in patient care was considered. Randomized, non-randomized, and cluster-randomized controlled trials (RCTs, NRCTs, CRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), and controlled before-after studies (CBAs) were included. Comparisons were: ""electronic versus paper health information""; EHI on different electronic devices (e.g. desktop, laptop, or tablet computers, etc.; cell/mobile phones); EHI through different user interfaces; EHI provided with or without an educational or training component;"" and EHI compared to any other type or source of information. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each study. GRADE was used to assess the quality of included studies. We reassessed previously excluded studies following our decision to define EHI logins as a measure of professional behavior. We report the results in natural units. Where possible, we calculated and reported the median effect size (odds ratio [OR], interquartile ranges [IQR]). Due to the large heterogeneity between studies, meta-analysis was not feasible. MAIN RESULTS: Two RCTs and four CRCTs involving 352 physicians, 48 residents and 135 allied health professionals were included. The overall risk of bias was low, as was the quality of the evidence. One comparison was supported by three studies and three comparisons were supported by single studies, but the results between the three studies were very heterogeneous. No studies were found to support HIE versus no alternative. Given these factors, it was not possible to determine the relative effectiveness of the interventions. All studies reported practitioner use of HIE, two reported adherence to electronic practice guidelines, and none reported patient outcomes. One trial (139 participants) measured guideline compliance for an electronic versus printed guideline, but reported no difference between groups (median OR 0.85). , IQR 0.74 to 1.08). One small crossover trial (10 participants) reported greater use of clinical guidelines when provided with a mobile versus stationary desktop computer (mean use per shift: intervention group (IG) 3.6, standard deviation (SD) 1, 7 versus control group (CG) 2.0 (SD 1.9), p value = 0.033). One crossover trial (203 participants) reported that use of a custom versus generic interface had little impact on practitioner use of EHI (adjusted mean difference in rate at endpoint: 0.77 logins /month/user, 95% confidence interval). (CI) CI 0.43 to 1.11). Three trials included education or training and reported increased use of HIE by professionals after training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provided no evidence that the use of EHI translates into better clinical practice or patient outcomes, although it suggests that when professionals receive EHI and education or training, the use of EHI increases. We have defined usage as the activity of logging into an EHI resource, but based on our findings, usage does not automatically translate to the application of EHI in practice. While the use of EHI can be an important component of evidence-based medicine, it alone is insufficient to improve patient care or clinical practices. For EHI to be applied in patient care, it will be necessary to understand why professionals are reluctant to apply EHI when treating people and determine the most effective way(s) to reduce this reluctance.",0,1,
1114,Interventions to modify health professionals' adherence to asthma guidelines: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Compliance with asthma guidelines by health professionals is poor. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of interventions to improve healthcare providers' adherence to asthma guidelines on the healthcare process and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Embase, the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, and the Education Research and Development Resource Base. Medical Continuing through July 2012. Independently matched investigators assessed study eligibility. The investigators abstracted the data sequentially and graded the evidence independently. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible studies were categorized by intervention: decision support, organizational change, feedback and audit, clinical pharmacy support, education only, quality improvement/pay for performance, multicomponent, and information only. Half were randomized trials (n = 35). There was moderate evidence of an increase in controller medication prescriptions for decision support, feedback and audit, and clinical pharmacy support, and low-grade evidence for organizational change and multicomponent interventions. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision support and clinical pharmacy interventions to increase the provision of asthma action plans/patient self-education. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision support tools to reduce emergency department visits, with low-grade evidence suggesting no benefit to this outcome from organizational change, education alone, and improved practice. quality/pay for performance. CONCLUSIONS: Decision support tools, feedback and audit, and clinical pharmacy support were more likely to improve provider adherence to asthma guidelines, as measured through outcomes of the medical care process. There is a need to evaluate interventions targeted at health care providers with standardized outcomes.",0,1,
1115,Interventions to promote evidence-based care for children with ADHD in primary care settings,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavior disorder among children. Community doctors are often the main providers of services for children with ADHD. The American Academy of Pediatrics has published a set of consensus guidelines that provides best practice diagnostic procedures for primary care physicians. These recommendations emphasize the importance of using the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, as a basis for making an ADHD diagnosis and conducting systematic follow-up, including the collection of parent and teacher rating scales to quantitatively assess the response to treatment. Although these recommendations have been widely disseminated and their adoption actively promoted, compliance with the guidelines is generally known to be poor. Two types of intervention models, ancillary service and office systems modification, have been proposed to promote the adoption of evidence-based ADHD practice in primary care settings. This article reviews the effectiveness of these intervention models and analyzes the cost and sustainability of each model in relation to the feasibility of spreading the intervention.",0,1,
1116,Intrinsic conflicts of interest in clinical research: a need for disclosure,"Protecting human subjects from investigators' conflicts of interest is critical to the integrity of clinical research. Personal financial conflicts of interest are addressed in university policies, professional society guidelines, public standards, and government regulation, but ""intrinsic conflicts of interest"" (conflicts of interest inherent in all clinical research) have received relatively less attention . Such conflicts arise in all clinical research efforts as a result of the tension between the responsibilities of professionals to their research and to their patients and academic and financial incentives. These conflicts must be disclosed to research subjects and handled as diligently as financial conflicts of interest.",0,0,
1117,Introduction: Understanding and Influencing Multilevel Factors Across the Continuum of Cancer Care,"Health care in the United States is notoriously expensive and often does not provide the care recommended in published guidelines. Therefore, there is a need to consider our approach to health service delivery. Cancer care is a good example to consider because it spans the continuum of health care issues from primary prevention to long-term survival and end-of-life care. In this monograph, we emphasize that health service delivery occurs in a multilevel system that includes organizations, teams, and individuals. To achieve health care delivery consistent with the Institute of Medicine's six quality goals (safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centeredness, and equity), we must influence multiple levels of that multilevel system. The notion that multiple levels of contextual influence affect behaviors through interdependent interactions is a well-established ecological view. This viewpoint has been used to analyze health service delivery and health disparities. However, the experience in considering multilevel interventions in health care is much less robust. This monograph includes 13 chapters relevant to expanding the research base for multilevel interventions in health care delivery. Topics include case studies of multilevel thinking in health care delivery, the state of knowledge on multilevel interventions, study design and measurement considerations, methods for combining interventions, time as a consideration in evaluating effects, measuring effects, simulations , application of multilevel thinking to health care systems and disparities, and implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Our goal is to outline an agenda for proceeding with multilevel intervention research, not because it guarantees a improvement in our current approach to health care, but because ignoring the complexity of the multilevel environment in which care occurs has not achieved the desired improvements in quality of care described by the Institute of Medicine at the turn of the millennium.",0,0,
1118,Investigation of breast symptoms in primary care: improving agreement with current best advice,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether a targeted intervention could improve primary care physicians' agreement with guidelines related to the management of women with breast symptoms. One hundred and twelve professionals from randomly selected areas of Australia prospectively audited their investigations for each woman with a new breast symptom during two 12-week periods, before and five months after the publication of the national guidelines. Between the two audits, the clinicians received practice feedback relative to their peers and attended a seminar in their local areas led by specialists from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. For five recommendations, there were statistically significant improvements at the second audit in line with the standard Investigation of a New Breast Symptom (INBS) guidelines. All of these were for breast lumps investigations. In the first audit, there were seven recommendations in which professionals already managed more than 80% of women according to the INBS, and in which there were no statistically significant increases in agreement in the second audit. Another six recommendations were less in agreement with recommendations prior to publication of the guidelines and did not improve significantly in the second audit. These tended to be for less common presentations and where the clinical findings were not consistent with the results of other tests. We conclude that a targeted intervention improved clinicians' agreement with current best advice for screening women presenting with new breast symptoms in a primary care setting. More educational programs are needed to improve investigations of rarer symptoms and increase physicians' confidence in the results of their clinical examinations.",0,0,
1119,Is it possible to predict better diabetes outcomes after diabetes self-management education: a mixed-methods longitudinal design?,"OBJECTIVE: To predict diabetes-related outcomes of people undertaking a type 2 diabetes self-management education (DSME) program from their baseline data. DESIGN: Longitudinal mixed methods experimental study. Blinded assessments of all baseline and process data were conducted by 6 practice nurses and 2 clinical scholars to predict clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes at 6 months post-DSME. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: -31 people with type 2 diabetes who had not previously undergone DSME. INTERVENTION: All participants completed the 12-week DSME 1:1 self-directed learning program of the Diabetes Manual with the support of practice nurses trained as Diabetes Manual facilitators. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), knowledge of diabetes, physical activity, waist circumference, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, anxiety, depression, demographics, discussion of change, and satisfaction with treatment. These variables were chosen because they are known to influence self-care behavior or have been influenced by a DSME program in the empirical evidence. RESULTS: Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were available for 27 participants, of whom 13 (48%) were male, 22 (82%) British White, with a mean age of 59 years and a mean duration of type 2 diabetes for 9.1 years. Significant reductions were found in HbA1c t(26)=2.35, p=0.03 and diabetes distress t(26)=2.30, p=0.03, and a significant increase in knowledge t(26) =-2.06, p=0.05 between baseline and 6 months. No significant changes were found in waist circumference, physical activity, anxiety, depression, or self-efficacy. Accuracy of predictions varied little between academic clinicians and practice nurses, but a great deal between outcomes (0-100%). The precision of the median and mode of the predicted result was 66.67%. The prediction accuracy for the key outcome of HbA1c was 44.44%. Diabetes distress had the highest prediction accuracy (81.48%). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in this small study were unable to identify people who were likely to achieve an improvement in DSME outcomes. DSME should be promoted to all patients with diabetes according to the guidelines.",0,0,
1120,"Is the type of provider associated with cancer screening and prevention: Advanced Practice Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants, and Physicians?","BACKGROUND: Physician recommendations for cancer detection and prevention are associated with patient compliance. However, time constraints may limit physicians' ability to provide all recommended preventive services, especially with the growing demand of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Team-based practice that includes Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and Physician Assistants (APRN/PA) can help meet this demand. This study investigates the relationship between an APRN/PA visit and receipt of guideline-consistent cancer screening and prevention recommendations. METHODS: Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to assess the type of provider seen and receipt of guideline-consistent cancer screening and prevention recommendations (n = 26,716). RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, women who saw a primary care physician (PCP) and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA in the past 12 months were more likely to meet breast cancer screening guidelines. cervix and breast than women who did not see a PCP or APRN/PA (all p < 0.0001 for provider type). Women and men who saw a PCP and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA were also more likely to receive colorectal cancer screening consistent with guidelines and advice to quit smoking and participate in active activities. than women and men who did not see a PCP or APRN/PA (all p < 0.01 for provider type). CONCLUSIONS: Seeing a PCP alone, or in conjunction with an APRN/PA is associated with patient receipt of guideline-consistent cancer screening and prevention recommendations. Integrating APRN/PA into primary care can help with the delivery of cancer screening and prevention services. Further intervention research efforts are needed to explore how APRN/PA will best increase cancer screening, HPV vaccination, and receipt of behavioral counseling, especially during this era of health care reform.",0,0,
1121,Is there a gap between recommended and 'real world' practice in managing depression in youth? An audit of the practice's medical record.,"BACKGROUND: The literature has shown that guideline dissemination alone is insufficient to ensure that guideline recommendations are incorporated into daily clinical practice. METHODS: Our objective was to investigate the gaps between guideline recommendations and clinical practice in the management of youth with depression by conducting an audit of medical records in a catchment area public mental health service for youth aged 15 to 25 years in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: The results showed that the assessment and recording of depression severity to ensure proper treatment planning was not systematic or consistent"";"" that most youth (74.5%) were prescribed an antidepressant before undergoing an adequate trial of psychotherapy and that less than 50% were monitored for improvement in depressive symptoms and suicide-related behaviors emerging from antidepressant treatment (35% and 30% respectively). Encouragingly, 92% of first-line prescriptions for people age 18 and younger who had never taken antidepressants before were for fluoxetine as recommended. CONCLUSIONS: This research has highlighted the need for specific strategies to ensure effective implementation. These strategies could include practice systems tools that allow systematic monitoring of depressive symptoms and adverse side effects, particularly suicidal behaviours. Furthermore, youth-specific psychotherapy that incorporates the most effective components for this age group, delivered in a youth-friendly manner, would likely aid effective implementation of guideline recommendations to engage in adequate trial of psychotherapy before start medication.",0,0,
1122,Are non-directed outreach visits effective in primary care? A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in clinical care. However, they are not autorun. Extension visits can improve prescription behavior. METHODS: Within a pragmatic randomized controlled before-and-after trial, involving all general practices in a health district, routine methods were used to distribute guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori eradication. A visit to intervention practices and an audit by a pharmacist trained in outreach visit techniques were offered. The intervention was assessed using level three Prescribing and Cost Analysis (PACT) data for metronidazole and omeprazole during the two 12-month periods around guideline introduction. RESULTS: Of the 38 intervention practices, 19 accepted an extension visit and three accepted the offer of an audit. There was a significant increase in omeprazole use during the study of 0.24 [95% confidence interval (CI) +0.19 to +0.29] dose units per year, but the offer had no effect [ -0.02 (95% CI -0.12 to +0.08) dose units] or acceptance of a visit [-0.03 (95% CI -0.15 to +0.08) units of dose]. The results for metronidazole were similar, with an increase in use of 0.028 (95% CI +0.018 to +0.038) dose units per year. The intervention effect was a non-significant change in prescription of -0.005 (95% CI -0.025 to +0.015) dose units. Accepting a visit had little effect on prescribing: a change of 0.003 (95% CI -0.021 to +0.027) dose units. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of untargeted outreach visits is probably not a worthwhile strategy.",0,0,

1124,It's not just that I encourage hand hygiene among health professionals by focusing on patients.,"Diseases often spread in hospitals because healthcare professionals don't wash their hands. Research suggests that to increase health and safety behaviors, it is important to highlight the personal consequences for the actor. However, because people (and health professionals in particular) tend to rely too heavily on personal immunity, the most effective messages about hand hygiene may be those that highlight its consequences for other people. In two hospital field experiments, we compared the effectiveness of hand hygiene signs that emphasized personal safety (""Hand hygiene keeps you from getting sick"") or patient safety (""Hand hygiene keeps you from getting sick""). patients get diseases""). We assessed hand hygiene by measuring the amount of soap and hand sanitizer gel used in dispensers (Experiment 1) and by conducting covert, independent observations of healthcare professionals' hand hygiene behaviors (Experiment 2). The results showed that changing a single word in the messages led to significant changes in behavior: health professionals' hand hygiene increased significantly when they were reminded of the implications for patients, but not when they were reminded of the implications for them. themselves.",1,1,

1126,JNC-7 Guidelines: Are They Still Relevant?,"The recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), published in 2003, are very relevant today. Reducing blood pressure (BP) to target in hypertensive patients is of paramount importance in reducing cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive drugs vary in their efficacy in lowering BP and may have BP-independent effects on cardiovascular events, as seen especially with respect to prevention of heart failure and stroke. Thiazide-type diuretics have been recommended as the preferred initial drugs for the treatment of hypertension in most patients, and this remains an appropriate recommendation. Several other classes were recommended as follows in priority, but beta-blockers should now have a minor role in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension. Although a new JNC report would be reassuring to practitioners and should include some changes from JNC 7, I believe that most of the recommendations are still relevant today.",0,0,
1127,MAGAZINE CLUB: Predictors of Provider Response to Clinical Decision Support: Lessons Learned from the Medicare Imaging Demonstration,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of imaging clinical decision support (CDS) varies. Our goal was to identify CDS factors that contribute to the cancellation or modification of imaging orders. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This pre-post study was conducted at four institutions that participated in the Medicare Imaging Demonstration. The intervention was CDS at order entry for selected outpatient imaging procedures. Based on the information entered, computerized alerts indicated to providers whether orders were not covered by guidelines, appropriate, of uncertain suitability, or inappropriate according to professional society guidelines. Order providers may override or accept CDS. We consider actionable alerts to be those that could lead to immediate order behavior change in the ordering physician (ie, cancellation of inappropriate orders or modification of orders of uncertain suitability that had a recommended alternative). Chi-square and logistic regression identified predictors of order cancellation or modification after an alert. RESULTS: A total of 98,894 radiology orders were entered (83,114 after the intervention). Vendors ignored 98.9%, modified 1.1%, and canceled 0.03% of orders in response to alerts. Actionable alerts had a 10-fold higher rate of modification (8.1% vs. 0.7%""; p < 0.0001) or cancellation (0.2% vs. 0.02%; p < 0.0001) compared to non-actionable alerts Orders from institutions with pre-existing image CDS had a seven times lower rate of cancellation or modification than sites with recently implemented CDS (1.4% vs. 0.2%; p < 0.0001) On multivariate analysis, actionable alerts were 12 times more likely to result in order cancellation or modification Orders on sites with pre-existing CDS were 7.7 times less likely to be canceled or modified ( p < 0.0001) CONCLUSION: Using the results of the Medicare Imaging Demonstration Project, we identified potential factors that were associated with the effect of CDS on provider ordering of images;"" these findings may have implications for the future design of such computerized systems.",1,1,
1128,Judgments about the normative behavior of health professionals: an experimental study,"OBJECTIVES: To explore judgments of rule-related behavior by health professionals and the general public in the UK, in a context of proliferating clinical guidelines and protocols. DESIGN: A questionnaire survey was used in which brief scenarios describing medical practice were presented to a sample of health professionals and members of the general public. METHODS: The health care sample consisted of 315 nurses, doctors and midwives from three English National Health Service (NHS) trusts who volunteered to participate in the study. A stratified sample of members of the general public (N = 350) was recruited through a market research organization. Three types of behavior (adherence to a protocol, violation of a protocol, and improvisation, where no protocol exists) and three types of patient outcomes (good, bad, poor) were manipulated within nine scenarios. Respondents were asked to make judgments about (1) the inappropriateness of the behavior (2) the likelihood that they would take further action, and (3) responsibility for the outcome. RESULTS: The findings suggest that the process of care has a greater effect on judgments about the behavior of health professionals than the result of that behavior. This was equally true for professional and public displays. CONCLUSIONS: The study has both theoretical and practical implications. First, information about the relationship of a behavior to existing rules has a stronger influence than the consequence of the behavior on attributions of responsibility. Second, the use of clinical protocols as a way to manage risk in the NHS may be counterproductive unless full compliance is achieved.",0,0,

1130,Judicious use of antibiotics for common pediatric respiratory infections,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among bacteria that cause common respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, has become a major global public health problem. The use of antibiotics, whether medically justified or not for a particular disease, contributes to the development of resistant bacteria. To help contain the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, members of the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently published principles for the judicious use of antibiotics in common pediatric respiratory infections, including the common cold, otitis media , sinusitis and pharyngotonsillitis. . This article reviews the CDC/AAP principles for the management of these diseases and describes the results of clinical practice studies in which efforts have been made to improve the judicious use of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the CDC/AAP principles in containing the rise of antimicrobial resistance depends on your practice. Results from clinical practice studies indicate that judicious use of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric respiratory infections can be achieved through education and persistence. More widespread educational and behavior modification efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and reduce the still burgeoning problem of bacterial resistance.",0,0,

DATA SOURCES/STUDY LOCATION: Interview and agency administrative data on 628 home care patients with a primary diagnosis of HF. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were managed by nurses randomly assigned to usual care or to one of two intervention groups. The basic intervention was an email to the patient's nurse outlining six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention supplemented the initial nursing reminder with additional resources for clinicians and patients. DATA COLLECTION: Patients were interviewed 45 days after admission to measure self-management behaviors, HF-specific outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-KCCQ), health-related quality of life (EuroQoL ) and the use of the service. MAIN FINDINGS: Both interventions improved the mean KCCQ total score (15.3 and 12.9 percent, respectively) relative to usual care (p< or = 0.05).

1134,"Just-in-time evidence-based email ""reminders"" in home health care: impact on nursing practices.","Goal. To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices by home care nurses caring for patients with heart failure (HF). Data sources/Study setup. Information on nursing practices was extracted from the medical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 for the care of 354 study nurses in a large urban nonprofit home care agency. Study design. The study used a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of two intervention groups after identification of an eligible patient. The core intervention was a single email reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention consisted of the initial email reminder supplemented by provider instructions, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. Data collection. At each home health visit provided by a study nurse to an eligible HF patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured graph abstraction tool was used to collect information on whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the study. email reminder. . Main findings. Both the basic and augmented interventions significantly increased the practice of evidence-based care, based on patient records, in the areas of patient assessment and HF disease management instruction. Although not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases and effect sizes were often large. Conclusions. The results of this randomized trial strongly support the efficacy of evidence-based just-in-time reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home care nurses who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.",1,1,
1135,Kids Safe and Smokefree (KiSS): a randomized controlled trial of a multilevel intervention to reduce secondhand smoke exposure in children,"BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke exposure (SeHS) harms children's health, but effective interventions to reduce childhood SEHS in the home and car have proven difficult to implement in pediatric practice. A multilevel intervention that combines counseling from pediatric health care providers with behavioral counseling and navigation to pharmacological smoking cessation aids may improve control of eSH in pediatric populations. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial uses a two-group randomized design with three measurement periods: pre-intervention, end of treatment, and 12-month follow-up. Smoking parents of children under 11 years of age are recruited from pediatric clinics. Clinical-level intervention includes integration of smoking intervention guidelines into electronic health record screens. The prompts guide providers to ask all parents about childhood SEHS, counsel on the harms of SEHS, and refer smokers to smoking cessation resources. After receiving the clinical intervention, eligible parents are randomized to receive: (a) a 3-month telephone behavioral counseling intervention designed to promote reduction of childhood SHSe, parental smoking cessation, and navigation to accessing nicotine replacement therapy or smoking cessation medications or (b) a nutrition education intervention for attention management. Healthcare providers and evaluators are blind to group assignment. Cotinine is used to bioassess the child's SHSe (primary outcome) and parental neglect status. DISCUSSION: This study tests an innovative multilevel approach to reduce childhood SeHS. The approach is sustainable, because clinics can easily integrate smoking intervention indications related to ""ask, advise and refer"" guidelines into electronic health records and refer smokers to free evidence-based behavioral counseling interventions , such as state quitlines.

1136,"Kindergarten Readiness After Prematurity: Integrating Health, Development, and Behavioral Functioning to Optimize Educational Outcomes for Vulnerable Children","In the last 20 years, many advances (eg, maternal steroids and surfactant) have changed the course of neonatal medicine. As a result, extremely premature babies survive medical complications that were once fatal. Once discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit, premature babies can continue to experience a spectrum of medical and developmental challenges, and their families face the potentially daunting task of raising a vulnerable child. Families may be referred to multiple systems of care, including primary care physicians, pediatric subspecialists, and early intervention services. The ultimate goal for premature babies is to optimize their motor, communication, social-emotional, and adaptive development, as well as to promote their learning at home, school, and in the community. As children transition to school, key indicators of their functional status include the amount of developmental, educational, habilitative, and behavioral supports they need to participate in learning activities with their peers. Success can be measured by whether preemies are ready for learning in large groups with their peers and the degree of support needed to make this important transition. The purpose of this review is to describe what is known about certain indicators of school readiness in preterm infants, including neurodevelopmental disorders, socioemotional skills, and social factors. We conclude with guidelines for using this transition as an important indicator of developmental trajectories that can help us better understand risk and resilience in this vulnerable population of children.",0,0,
1137,"Knowledge, attitudes, and use of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening among family physicians.","BACKGROUND: Results from the National Lung Screening Trial showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality when high-risk patients were screened with low-dose computed tomography. low (LDCT) versus chest radiography (CXR). The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a grade B recommendation for LDCT screening, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and private insurers now cover the cost of screening under certain conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and use of LDCT screening for lung cancer among family physicians. METHODS: A 32-item questionnaire was distributed to members of the South Carolina Academy of Family Physicians in 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There were 101 respondents, and most had incorrect knowledge about which organizations recommended screening. Many doctors continued to recommend CXR for lung cancer screening. Most felt that LDCT screening increased the odds of detecting disease earlier (98%) and that the benefits outweighed the harms (75%). Concerns included unnecessary procedures (88%), stress/anxiety (52%), and radiation exposure (50%). Most physicians discussed the risks/benefits of screening with their patients to some extent (76%); however, more than 50% reported having made 1 or no screening recommendation in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: Most family physicians report discussing LDCT with patients at high risk for lung cancer; however, referrals remain low. There are gaps in clinicians' knowledge of screening guidelines and reimbursement, and this indicates a need for further educational outreach. The development of decision aids can facilitate shared discussions for decision making about screening, and targeted interventions can fill knowledge gaps. Cancer 2016;""122:2324-2331.

1138,Translation of knowledge of research results.,"Background One of the most consistent findings of clinical and health services research is the failure to translate research into practice and policy. As a result of these gaps between evidence and practice and policy, patients do not benefit optimally from advances in medical care and are exposed to unnecessary risks of iatrogenic harm, and health care systems are exposed to high costs. unnecessary costs that generate significant opportunity costs. Over the past decade, there has been increasing international research and policy attention on how to bridge the gap between evidence and practice and policy. In this paper, we summarize current concepts and evidence to guide knowledge translation activities, defined as T2 research (the translation of new clinical knowledge into better health). We structured the article around five key questions: what should be transferred""; to whom should research knowledge be transferred; by whom should research knowledge be transferred; how should research knowledge be transferred""; And, with what effect should research knowledge be transferred? Discussion We suggest that the basic unit of knowledge translation should generally be up-to-date systematic reviews or other syntheses of research findings. Knowledge translators need to identify the key messages for different target audiences and convert them into language and knowledge translation products that are easily assimilated by different audiences. The relative importance of knowledge translation for different target audiences will vary depending on the type of research, and the appropriate endpoints of knowledge translation may vary between different stakeholder groups. There are a large number of planned knowledge translation models, derived from different disciplinary, contextual (i.e. scenarios) and target audience viewpoints. Most of these suggest that planned knowledge translation for healthcare professionals and consumers is more likely to be successful if the choice of knowledge translation strategy is based on an assessment of potential barriers and facilitators. Although our evidence on the possible effectiveness of different strategies to overcome specific barriers remains incomplete, there are a variety of informative systematic reviews of interventions directed at health professionals and consumers (ie, patients, family members, and informal carers) and of important factors. for research use by policymakers. Summary There is a substantial (albeit incomplete) evidence base to guide the choice of knowledge translation activities aimed at health professionals and consumers. The evidence base on the effects of different knowledge translation approaches targeting health care policy makers and senior managers is much weaker, but there are a large number of innovative approaches that warrant further evaluation.",0,0,
1139,Translation of knowledge from the American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy on syncope using computerized clinical decision support,"OBJECTIVES: To influence medical practice behavior after implementation of a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the 2007 ACEP Clinical Policy on Syncope recommendations. METHODS: This was a pre-post intervention. with a prospective cohort and retrospective controls. We performed a review of the medical records of consecutive adult patients with syncope. A computerized CDSS was incorporated into the emergency department information system (EDIS) that prompted clinicians to explain their decision-making regarding imaging and admission in patients with syncope based on ACEP clinical policy recommendations. Medical records of 410 consecutive adult patients presenting with syncope prior to implementation were reviewed, and 301 records were reviewed after implementation. Primary outcomes were medical practice performance as demonstrated by admission rate and head computed tomography (CT) imaging rate before and after implementation. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the admission rate before and after the intervention (68.1% vs. 60.5%, respectively, p = 0.036). There was no significant difference in the rate of head CT imaging before and after the intervention (39.8% vs. 43.2%, p = 0.358). There were seven physicians who saw ten or more patients pre- and post-intervention. Subset analysis of the practice behavior of these seven physicians revealed a slightly significant difference in admission rate before and after the intervention (74.3% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.0495) and no difference significant in the rate of computed tomography of the head before and after the intervention. -intervention (42.9% vs 45.4%, p = 0.660). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of an evidence-based CDSS based on the ACEP clinical policy recommendations on syncope was correlated with a change in medical practice behavior in an urban academic emergency department. This change suggests that the recommendations of the emergency medicine clinical practice guidelines can be incorporated into the medical workflow of an EDIS to improve the quality of practice.",1,1,
1140,Knowledge versus practice: the need for education for successful guideline implementation,"This study assessed clinicians' familiarity with a bronchiolitis practice guideline, assessed attitudes toward the guidelines, determined preference of educational materials for guideline accessibility, and examined the relationship between familiarity with the guideline and attitudes with behaviors in clinical practice. Six months after guideline implementation, surveys were distributed to eligible clinicians. The response rate was 68%. Retrospective analyzes of inhalation therapies in three study cohorts were also performed. Most clinicians surveyed in this study were aware of and used a recently introduced guideline, although use of unproven inhalation therapies continued.

1141,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices around breast cancer screening in educated Appalachian women.","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine how and what women learn about breast cancer and screening practices and what factors influence women's breast cancer screening practices. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of questionnaire data collected at the time of enrollment in a clinical trial. SETTING: Breast care center of a mid-Atlantic academic health sciences center. SAMPLE: 185 women in a predominantly Appalachian, entirely rural state. METHODS: Participants completed the Modified Toronto Breast Self-Examination Inventory and questions related to personal mammography practices at enrollment prior to randomization in a longitudinal clinical intervention study. KEY RESEARCH VARIABLES: women's demographics, knowledge of breast cancer screening practices, adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines, and motivation, knowledge, and practical competence around breast cancer screening. FINDINGS: These educated women had knowledge deficits about breast cancer, breast cancer risk factors, and screening guidelines, particularly timing and practice behaviors for breast self-examination. Women who had received education about health care and cancer screening from health care providers, including advanced practice nurses, were more knowledgeable about breast cancer and screening practices. CONCLUSIONS: Women still have knowledge deficits about breast cancer, breast cancer screening, and personal risk factors. Also, some educated women in this study did not get breast cancer screening according to current guidelines. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Physicians should continue to remind and update women about breast disease, and cancer screening practices in women should be strengthened. All levels of providers must improve their rates of performing clinical breast exams with physical exams. Nurses, who have a great influence on women's health care, must keep up-to-date in their knowledge of breast disease, detection and treatment.",0,0,
1142,KRAS and colorectal cancer: ethical and pragmatic issues for effecting real-time change in clinical trials and oncology practice,"Systemic therapy has led to a median survival time for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) nearly four times longer than expected with the best supportive care, a result achieved by combining targeted chemotherapeutic and biologic agents. Although the latter may include anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, we now have strong evidence that patients whose tumors harbor mutated KRAS will not benefit from this class of agent. However, acceptance of the reliability and importance of the KRAS data took several years to evolve for a variety of reasons. The timeline from the presentation and publication of small retrospective phase II studies to the widespread acceptance of the predictive value of KRAS and behavioral changes, specifically, modifications of ongoing national trials in advanced/metastatic CRC, changes in national guidelines, and practice patterns, and adjustments to labeled indications for monoclonal antibodies - was long. In this commentary, we discuss whether the process of disclosing data on the status of KRAS and the treatment of patients with advanced CRC was effective in allowing timely decisions regarding ongoing publicly funded clinical trials and whether or not such decisions were rational and ethical. The general objectives are to highlight the lessons learned regarding the early disclosure of clinical trial results, as well as the investigation and adoption of new scientific data, and to propose modifications to handle similar situations in the future.",0,0,
1143,The design of the laboratory test form influences the ordering of tests by general practitioners in the Netherlands,"The effect of listing fewer laboratory tests on the test request form on the test requesting behavior of a group of 47 Dutch general practitioners was studied. The number of laboratory tests ordered by this experimental group over a 12-month period was recorded. The old usual standard form was used by a control group of 28 general practitioners in a different region. After having used the old standard form with 178 tests for 5 months, the experimental group received forms listing only 15 hematology and chemistry tests plus several urine and stool tests, with space left for 'others'. A comparison of the experimental and control periods showed that the number of tests requested per month in the experimental group was reduced by 18. When the usual standard form was reintroduced, GPs rapidly returned to their previous pattern. The results revealed that the fixed and often unsound routine influences the use of additional diagnostic procedures. Also, limiting and restructuring the evidence request forms may break the routine, but does not essentially change the logic of the evidence request behavior.",1,1,
1144,Lack of Effectiveness of Reminder Charts on JNC-VI and NCEP III Family Medicine Residents' Guideline Knowledge and Attitudes,"BACKGROUND: The literature demonstrates that resident physicians and practicing physicians have an attitudinal-behavioral mismatch in their positive attitudes toward clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and the implementation of these guidelines in clinical practice patterns. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to determine whether changing a previously identified CPG adherence factor (accessibility) would produce a significant increase in family medicine residents' knowledge and attitude toward the guidelines. The primary study intervention involved posting a summary of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Screening, Evaluation, and and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP III) CPG in all patient registries (>18 years) for a period of three months. The JNC VI and NCEP III CPGs were also distributed to each Wayne State family medicine resident, and a copy of each CPG was posted in the preceptor's area of the involved clinics. All residents were administered identical pre- and post-intervention questionnaires on knowledge and attitudes about CPGs. RESULTS: Post-intervention analysis failed to demonstrate a significant difference in CPG knowledge. A statistically significant difference was found after the intervention only in the attitude question. Barriers to compliance with the CPGs were identified as 1) lack of CPG instruction""; 2) lack of critical appraisal capacity; 3) insufficient time; 4) lack of accessibility to the CPGs""; and 5) lack of teaching modeling. CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate significant post-intervention changes in CPG knowledge, and only one question reflected a change in attitude. Increased resident access to clinic time, increased faculty modeling, and implementation of an electronic check-in/reminder system that uses a team-based approach are adherence factors to consider for further investigation. The interpretation of non-compliance with the CPG will benefit from a causal matrix focused on the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of the doctor. Recent findings on resident knowledge-behavior discordance may steer future research into physician CPG noncompliance from generalized barrier research and toward developing information that maximizes the sense of urgency and certainty of clinical practice. single doctor.",0,1,
1145,Depression in old age in primary care. How well are we doing?,"OBJECTIVE: To know the attitudes of primary care physicians towards their abilities to detect and treat depression in the elderly. DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire sent to 1,000 primary care physicians in the state of Michigan. SETTING: The survey was sent to physicians practicing general internal medicine or family practice. PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was sent to 500 MD and 500 DO physicians; general internal medicine and family medicine were given equal representation. Of all 1,000 physicians, 60% (n = 604) responded, 51% (n = 309 ) were MD's, 48% (n = 295) were DO's, 41% (n = 245) were general internists, and 59% (n = 359) were family physicians MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Despite positive attitudes about their abilities to screen for and treat depression in the elderly, only a quarter of respondents routinely used a screening tool in practice Forty-one percent of all clinicians were unaware of depression practice guidelines. Family physicians were more confident in their treatment skills than general internists (85% vs 50%; chi 2 = 11.42, p < or = .003). Male physicians more frequently endorsed pharmacological treatment, while female physicians more frequently used counseling and exercise techniques to treat older depressed patients. Half of all physicians felt informed about community resources for treating older patients with depression. CONCLUSIONS: This survey identified several perceived needs for future targeted interventions: (1) additional exposure to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines for all primary care physicians, (2) physician-specific counseling skills intervention male physicians and medication management for female physicians, and (3) additional continuing medical education intervention for practicing general internists. More research is needed to correlate clinicians' attitudes with subsequent behaviors to fully appreciate the nature of treating depression in old age within the primary care setting.",0,0,

1147,Learning Assessment: Combining Implementation and Quality Improvement Research Methods to Study Innovations in Health Care,"Background In healthcare change interventions, on-the-ground learning about the implementation process is often lost due to a primary focus on improving outcomes. This article describes learning assessment, a methodological approach that combines quality improvement and implementation research methods to study innovations in health care. Methods Learning assessment is an approach to assessing multiple organizations. Qualitative and quantitative data is collected to perform real-time assessment of implementation processes while assessing changes in context, facilitating quality improvement through execution charts and audit and feedback, and generating lessons transportable. Five principles underlie this approach: (1) collect data to describe the changes made by healthcare organizations and how the changes are implemented""; (2) collect process and outcome data relevant to healthcare organizations and for the research team; (3) Assess multi-level contextual factors that affect implementation, process, outcome, and portability; (4) Help healthcare organizations use data for continuous quality improvement; and (5) implement common measurement strategies to generate transportable results organizations by: (1) establishing a detailed understanding of the baseline implementation plan (2) identifying target populations and tracking actions relevant process data (3) collect and analyze real-time quantitative and qualitative data on important contextual factors (4) ) s synthesize emerging data and findings and share them with stakeholders on an ongoing basis;"" and (5) harmonize and foster learning from process and outcome data. Application to a multisite program focused on primary care and behavioral health integration shows the feasibility and utility of learning assessment to generate real-time insights into evolving implementation processes. Conclusions Learning assessment generates systematic and rigorous cross-organizational findings on the implementation of health care innovations, while improving organizational capacity and accelerating translation of findings by facilitating continuous learning within individual sites. Researchers evaluating change initiatives and healthcare organizations implementing improvement initiatives can benefit from a learning evaluation approach.",0,0,
1148,Learning with computerized guides in general practice? A randomized controlled trial.,"Bottom. Evidence-based guidelines are considered an important instrument to transfer scientifically generated knowledge to daily clinical practice and guarantee high standards of clinical care. Despite their wide promulgation, clinical guidelines have so far had limited impact on individual professional learning and changing daily medical practice. Goals. Our objectives were (i) to study a potential increase in knowledge among German general practitioners after the implementation of evidence-based and web-based guidelines and (ii) to identify and analyze potential barriers to individual professional learning with computerized guidelines. Methods. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial involving 72 GPs (21% women, 79% men) was conducted. The intervention group (n = 38) had access to the clinical guidelines via the Internet or CD-ROM, the control group did not (n = 34). Both groups received a standardized two-part questionnaire. An increase in knowledge was measured with 25 multiple-choice questions related to four different medical topics. In addition, the reasons for using or not using computerized guidelines after access to the guidelines was open to all participating physicians were analyzed. Results. There was no significant increase in knowledge in the intervention group (P = 0.69). Twenty-two (58%) GPs in the intervention group had used the guidelines. Unspecified curiosity (76%) and a specific medical question (38%) were the predominant reasons for use among clinicians who had used the guidelines. Among 'non-users', 78% indicated that 'lack of time' was the main reason for not using the guides. Conclusion. Efficient knowledge transfer was not achieved through computerized guides. Usage, individual learning and potential implementation depend on proper incentives and pragmatic aspects of clinical practice: easy and fast access.",0,1,

1153,Lessons from the evaluation of the UK NHS R&D Implementation Methods Program,"Background Concern for the effective use of research was a major factor behind the creation of the NHS R&D Program in 1991. In 1994, an advisory group was established to identify research priorities in the implementation of research. The Implementation Methods Program (IMP) grew out of this, and its start-up group funded 36 projects. In 2000, responsibility for the program passed to the National Coordinating Center for NHS Organization and Service Delivery R&D, which asked the Health Economics Research Group (HERG), Brunel University, to carry out an assessment in 2002. By then, most of the projects had been completed. . This evaluation was intended to cover: the quality of the products, the lessons learned about the communication strategy and the start-up process, and the benefits of the projects. Methods We adopt a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods. They included: desk review, stakeholder interviews, questionnaires for funded principal investigators, questionnaires for potential users, and desk analysis. Results Quantitative evaluation of outputs and dissemination revealed that the IMP funded useful research projects, some of which had considerable impact on the various categories of the HERG recovery model, such as publications, additional research, research training, impact on health policy and clinical practice. . Qualitative results from interviews with commissioning and advisory group members indicated that when the IMP was established, implementation research was a relatively unexplored field. This was reflected in advisory and commissioning group members' understanding of their roles, in how priorities for research were chosen and developed, and in how research projects were commissioned. The ideological and methodological debates associated with these decisions have continued among those who work in this field. The need for an effective communication strategy for the program as a whole was particularly important. However, such a strategy was never developed, making it difficult to establish the overall influence of the IMP as a program. Conclusion Our findings about the impact of funded work and the difficulties faced by IMP developers have implications for the development of strategic research programs in general, as well as for the development of more effective research in this field.",0,0,

A recent move around increased pricing transparency has been suggested as a way to slow the rate of spending growth, with legislative efforts at both the state and federal levels. While this seems like a good idea at first glance, simply providing pricing information to physicians, particularly interns, may not achieve the kind of big changes in practice patterns that proponents hope for. How price transparency is implemented will likely play a significant role in its effectiveness as an intervention.

1156,LGB Affirmative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Transdiagnostic Minority Stress Approach,"OBJECTIVES: We tested the preliminary efficacy of a tailored transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral treatment for improving depression, anxiety, and co-occurring health risks (ie, alcohol use, sexual compulsivity, condomless sex) among gay and bisexual young adult men. Treatment accommodations focused on reducing minority stress processes that underlie mental health disparities related to sexual orientation. METHOD: Young homosexual and bisexual men (n = 63""; M age = 25.94) were randomized to receive immediate treatment or a 3-month waiting list. At baseline assessments, at 3 months and 6 months, participants completed minority mental health and stress self-reports and an interview about risk behavior from the past 90 days. RESULTS: Compared to waiting list, treatment significantly reduced depressive symptoms (b = -2.43, 95% CI: -4.90, 0.35, p < 0.001), alcohol use problems (b = -3.79, 95% CI: -5.94, -1.64). , p < 0.001), sexual compulsiveness (b = -5.09, 95% CI: -8.78, -1.40, p < 0.001), and sex without a condom during the last 90 days with casual partners (b = -1.09, 95% CI: -1.80, -0.37, p < .001), and improved self-efficacy in condom use (b = 10.08, 95% CI: 3.86, 16.30, p < .001). Treatment produced moderately and marginally significant improvements greater than waiting list in anxiety symptoms (b = -2.14, 95% CI: -4.61, 0.34, p = 0.09) and consumption binge drinking in the last 90 days (b = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.71, 0.07, p = 0.09). In general, the effects were maintained during follow-up. Minor stress processes showed small improvements in the expected direction. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated preliminary support for the first tailored intervention to address the co-occurring health problems of gay and bisexual men originating from minority stress. If found to be effective compared to standard evidence-based treatments, the treatment will have substantial potential to help clinicians translate affirmative LGB treatment guidelines into evidence-based practice.

1157,Lifestyle advice provided by primary health care to prevent cardiovascular diseases,"BACKGROUND: The Working Group on Hypertension of the Norwegian College of General Practitioners reports in this document on the documentation on behavioral advice in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension is emphasized. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Recommendations are based primarily on updated meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. Hypertension is treated to prevent cardiovascular diseases"";"" that's why we put an emphasis on documentation with meaningful endpoints. The validity of the documentation for general practice is assessed. We also look at whether certain methods or theories for behavior change might be useful to the general practitioner. RESULTS: The value of anti-smoking advice, dietary advice (increasing intake of grains, vegetables, fruit, poultry, and fish), and exercise advice is well documented and applicable in general practice. Respect for patient autonomy and concern for the patient and their health-related habits appear to be important factors in improving the physician's ability to influence patient behavior. INTERPRETATION: The value of lifestyle advice is well documented and should play an important role in clinical strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients.",0,0,

1159,Lifestyle counseling in primary care: long-term effects on cholesterol level,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effectiveness of lifestyle advice for subjects at low to moderate cardiovascular (CV) risk in primary care. METHODS: DESIGN: Prospective comparison of baseline versus postintervention, and comparison of enrolled patients versus control subjects drawn from a large primary care database. SETTING: 94 general practices in Italy. PARTICIPANTS: All hypercholesterolemic subjects aged 20-70 years who did not qualify for statin treatment according to the guidelines and who were seen in 12 predetermined business days""; 713 patients; 94 general practitioners. INTERVENTION: Short (5-10 min) intervention educational (qualitative dietary advice, promotion of walking or other aerobic physical activities);"" distributing simple dietary advice at the doctor's discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cholesterol level and global CV risk calculated according to the Framingham equation. RESULTS: Total cholesterol and global CV risk (10 years) decreased by 0.31 mmol/l (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.23-0.40) and 1.35% (p < 0.01). , 95% CI -1.73 to -0.97), respectively. after a 54-month follow-up. The included patients showed a greater decrease in total cholesterol than the control patients: 2.24% (p < 0.05, 95% CI: 0.58-3.91%). CONCLUSIONS: A simple long-term in-office lifestyle counseling program produces a small but clinically significant reduction in total cholesterol and overall CV risk. This finding should encourage GPs to routinely offer simple, unstructured lifestyle advice to all their patients.",0,0,
1160,Lifestyle interventions in primary health care: professional and organizational challenges,"BACKGROUND: Interventions that support patients' efforts at lifestyle changes that reduce tobacco use, hazardous alcohol use, unhealthy eating habits, and insufficient physical activity represent important areas of development for care. health. Current research shows that it is a challenge to reorient health care towards health promotion. The aim of this study was to explore the scope of health professionals' work with lifestyle interventions in Swedish primary health care, and to describe professional knowledge, attitudes and perceived organizational support for lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle. METHODS: The study is based on a web-based cross-sectional survey of general practitioners, other physicians, residents, public health nurses, and registered nurses (n = 315) in primary health care. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of participants indicated that lifestyle interventions were a substantial part of their duties. Most (77%) would like to work more with patients' lifestyles. Health professionals generally reported in-depth knowledge of lifestyle intervention methods for disease prevention. Significant differences were found between professional groups regarding specific knowledge and degree of work with lifestyle interventions. Alcohol was the least addressed lifestyle habit. Management was supportive, but structures to support work with lifestyle interventions were poor and the need for national guidelines was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals reported in-depth knowledge and positive attitudes towards lifestyle interventions. When planning further implementation of lifestyle interventions in primary health care, differences between professional groups in knowledge, scope of work with promoting healthy lifestyles, and related issues should be considered. with lifestyle and the provision of organizational support, such as national guidelines.",0,0,
1161,Lifestyle or life-saving drugs? A survey of consumer and primary health care professional opinion on over-the-counter statins,"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter (OTC) simvastatin 10 mg became available in the UK in July 2004 with the aim of improving the primary prevention of ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To document the views of key stakeholders (general practitioners [GPs], community pharmacists, and consumers) on issues related to the reclassification of simvastatin to OTC availability, highlight differences between stakeholder groups, and identify factors likely to influence consumer behavior. METHODS: Eight months after the UK launch of OTC simvastatin, a self-administered questionnaire survey of GPs, community pharmacists, and potentially eligible consumers was conducted. Participants were asked about their knowledge of the drug, their willingness to use such drugs, and their views on relevant management practices. RESULTS: Awareness of OTC simvastatin was high among GPs but low among consumers. Although pharmacists favored OTC availability, consumers and physicians generally thought it was not a good idea. GPs and pharmacists cited increased consumer choice as the most important likely benefit"";"" consumers thought that the potential savings for the NHS were equally important. Medication misuse and neglect of lifestyle risk factors were unanimously considered the most important likely risks. Unlike most pharmacists, most GPs thought current dosing schedules were inappropriate, but there was consensus that long-term non-adherence would likely reduce any benefit of treatment. Most respondents agreed that GPs should be informed if their patients were using OTC statins, but disagreed on the best way to communicate this information. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of OTC statins did not appear to be considered a popular public health intervention by consumers and GPs, as the drugs were widely perceived to be prone to misuse. However, OTC availability was favored by pharmacists, who saw this as empowering for both consumers and themselves. Key issues remain in the delivery, management, and evaluation of the public health impact of this intervention.",0,0,
1162,Lifetime prevalence of gender-based violence in women and the relationship with mental disorders and psychosocial function,"Context Physical violence, rape, sexual assault and stalking by an intimate partner are pervasive and concurrent forms of gender-based violence (GBV). An association between these forms of abuse and lifelong mental illness and psychosocial disability among women needs to be examined. Objectives To assess the association of GV and mental disorder, its severity and comorbidity, and psychosocial functioning among women. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional study based on the 2007 Australian National Mental Health and Wellbeing Survey of 4451 women (65% response rate) aged 16 to 85 years. Main outcome measures The Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 of the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative was used to assess the lifetime prevalence of any mental disorder, anxiety, mood disorder, substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Also included were indices of lifetime exposure to trauma, including gender-based violence, sociodemographic characteristics, economic status, family history of mental disorders, social support, general mental and physical functioning, quality of life and general disability. Results A total of 1,218 women (27.4%) reported experiencing at least 1 type of GBV. For women exposed to 3 or 4 types of gender-based violence (n = 139), the rates of mental disorders were 77.3% (odds ratio [OR], 10.06""; confidence interval [CI] of 95%, 5.85-17.30) for anxiety disorders, 52.5% (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.31-5.60) for mood disorder, 47.1 % (OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 3.46-9.10) for substance use disorder, 56.2% (OR, 15.90; 95% CI, 8.32-30.20) for PTSD, 89.4% (OR, 11.00; 95% CI, 5.46-22.17) for any mental disorder and 34.7% (OR, 14.80; 95% CI, 6.89- 31.60) for suicide attempts violence was associated with a more severe current mental disorder (OR, 4.60; 95% CI, 2.93-7.22), higher rates of 3 or more disorders over the lifetime (OR, 7.79; 95% CI, 6.10-9.95), physical disability (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.82-8.82), mental disability (OR , 7.14; 95% CI, 2.87-17.75), impaired quality of life (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.60-5.47), increased days of sick leave (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.43 -4.05) and general disability (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.99-3.75).

1163,'Like sugar and honey': the entrenched ethics of a larval control project in The Gambia,"This article describes a malaria research project in The Gambia to provoke reflection on the social value of transnational research. The Larval Control Project (LCP) investigated the efficacy of a microbial insecticide in reducing vector density and ultimately clinical malaria in Gambian children. The LCP protocol outlined a clinical surveillance scheme involving Village Health Workers (VHWs) supported by project nurses. Combining insights from ethnographic fieldwork conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in Farafenni from 2005 to 2009, open-ended interviews with project nurses, and eight focus group discussions conducted with participating mothers in October 2007, we consider the social impact of the LCP research method in the context of several years of research activity. We found that while participants associated the LCP with the clinical care it provided, they also viewed the collaboration between nurses and VHWs as adding additional benefits. Organized around the operational functions of the trial, the small-scale collaborations provided the platform from which to build local capacity. While the ethical guidelines emphasize considerations that should be added to the experimental effort in southern countries (for example, developing informed consent processes, developing community engagement strategies, or providing therapeutic access to participants after the trial concludes) , these findings suggest that shifting attention from complementing ethics protocols to everyday research work—embedding ethics throughout scientific activity—may provide a stronger foundation for reinforcing the relationship between scientific rigor and social value.",0,0,
1164,Limited impact of a multicenter intervention to improve the quality and efficiency of pneumonia care,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of a multifactorial intervention to improve the quality, efficiency, and patient understanding of care for community-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN: Time series cohort study. SETTING: Four academic health centers in the New York City metropolitan area. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive adults hospitalized for pneumonia during a 5-month period before (n = 1,013) and after (n = 1,081) implementation of an inpatient quality improvement (QI) initiative. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team of opinion leaders developed evidence-based and critical pathway treatment guidelines, conducted educational sessions with physicians, distributed pocket reminder cards, promoted standardized orders, and developed bilingual patient education materials. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The average age was 71.4 years, with 44.1% of cases at low risk, 36.8% at moderate risk, and 19.2% at high risk. The pre- and post-intervention groups were well matched for age, gender, race, nursing home, pneumonia severity, initial presentation, and most major comorbidities. The intervention increased the use of guideline-recommended antimicrobial therapy from 78.1% to 83.4% (p = 0.003). There was also a borderline decrease in the proportion of patients discharged before becoming clinically stable, from 27.0 to 23.5% (p = 0.06). However, there were no improvements in the other objective indicators, including time to first dose of antibiotics, proportion receiving antibiotics within 8 hours, timely switch to oral antibiotics, timely discharge, length of stay, or the results of patient education. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world QI program was able to modestly improve some quality indicators, but did not affect resource use or patient knowledge of their disease. Changing medical and organizational behavior in academic health centers will require the development and implementation of more intensive and system-oriented strategies.",0,0,
1165,Local clinical guidelines: description and evaluation of a participatory method for their development and implementation,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines are rarely followed with immediate change in clinical behavior. We present our experience of an active educational method for local development and implementation of a guideline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory method for the development of local clinical guidelines. METHODS: A district trial of the effect of guideline development incorporating the active participation of intended recipients in subsequent relevant prescription. It was carried out in the Wirral Family Health Services Authority district (the Wirral Peninsula) and comprises 69 general practices covering a population of 345,763. An exemplary guideline on 'hypertension in the elderly' was developed using the method described. The main drug recommended was bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily. Differences in prescribed daily doses (PDD) of bendrofluazide 2.5 mg tablets per quarter per 1000 prescription units (age-weighted population) between the intervention district and England as a whole were measured. RESULTS: The comparison of the data from the intervention district with the data from England shows a mean difference of 122.49 PDD before and 206.34 PDD after the production of the guide, this change is statistically highly significant (Mann-Whitney two tails P < 0.0001""; 95% CI = 36.51-104.77 Pooled regression analysis shows no significant difference (0.89) in slope gradients before guideline production (P = 0.35, 95% CI = -3.97-5.76), but the difference in slope gradients after (12.95) is highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001;"" 95% CI = 8,17-17,73).The data suggest that the change in clinical behavior persisted for at least two years.CONCLUSION:Involvement of targeted general practitioners and local specialists in guideline development using an active educational method such as described was followed by a favorable change in clinical behavior that persisted for a l least two years.",0,0,
1166,Local Learning Collaborations for Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): From Four Regional Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs),"BACKGROUND: Four practice-based research networks (PBRNs) participated in a project to increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A multicomponent organizational intervention involved regionally proximate primary care practices in a series of facilitated meetings, termed local learning collaborations (LLCs). METHODS: The 2-wave strategy began with 8 practices in each PBRN receiving practice facilitation and subsequently joining an LLC. A mixed-methods sequential design addressed the behavior, content, and fidelity of the intervention"";"" clinicians from 2 PBRNs participated in interviews and PBRN coordinators reflected on implementation challenges. RESULTS: LLCs were formed in 3 PBRNs, with 121 monthly meetings held in 20 LLCs. Just over half of the participants were physicians. Qualitative data suggest that clinicians increased the priority of CKD care, improved their knowledge and skills, felt satisfied with the project, and attempted to improve care. Implementation challenges were encountered and concerns about sustainability were raised. CONCLUSION: While PBRNs can successfully leverage resources to disseminate treatment guidelines, and LLCs are well accepted by clinical staff, LLC formation was not feasible for 1 PBRN, with others struggling to meet regularly and have data of performance available despite logistical support.",0,0,
1167,Long-term efficacy in prescribing two multifaceted educational interventions: results of two large-scale cluster randomized trials.,"INTRODUCTION: Information on the benefits and risks of medications is a key element that affects physicians' prescription decisions. Outreach visits that promote independent information have been shown to be moderately effective in changing prescribing behaviors. OBJECTIVES: To test the short-term and long-term effectiveness of pharmacist-led small group meeting prescribing by general practitioners. METHODS: Two open-label cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in a large-scale NHS setting. Evidence-based material prepared ad hoc was used considering a therapeutic area approach--TEA, with informative materials on osteoporosis or prostatic hyperplasia--and a single drug-oriented approach--SIDRO, with informative materials on me-too drugs from 2 different classes: barnidipine or prulifloxacin. In each study, the 115 Primary Care Groups in an area of northern Italy (2.2 million inhabitants, 1737 general practitioners) were randomly assigned to small group educational meetings, in which available evidence was provided along with data. drug use and clinical scenarios. The main outcomes were changes in the six-month prescription of targeted drugs. Longer-term outcomes (24 and 48 months) were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the TEA trial, one of the four main outcomes showed a reduction (alfuzosin prescription compared to tamsulosin and terazosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia: prescription rate -8.5%, p = 0.03). Another primary outcome (risedronate prescription) showed a reduction at 24 and 48 months (-7.6%, p = 0.02"" and -9.8%, p = 0.03), but not at six months (-5.1%, p = In the SIDRO trial, both primary outcomes showed a statistically significant reduction (barnidipine prescription -9.8%, p = 0.02; prulifloxacin prescription -11.1%, p = 0.04), which persisted or increased over time INTERPRETATION: These two cluster RCTs showed the large-scale feasibility of a complex educational program in an NHS setting and its potentially relevant long-term impact on prescribing habits, in particular when focusing on a single drug National health systems should invest in independent drug information programs TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN05866587.",0,0,
1168,"Long-term effects of an occupational health guideline on outcomes related to employee body weight, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and quality of life: results of a randomized controlled trial.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a draft occupational health guideline, aimed at preventing weight gain, on outcomes related to employee body weight, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and quality of life. METHODS: In a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 16 occupational physicians (OPs) and 523 employees, guideline-based care was compared with usual OP care between 2009 and 2011 in the Netherlands. Guideline-based care consisted of (i) providing advice to employers on how to assess and intervene in the obesogenic work environment, (ii) conducting five face-to-face behavior change counseling sessions with employees to improve their lifestyles , and (iii) evaluating the result and maintaining sections i and ii. Data were collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 month follow-up. To assess the effects of the intervention, multilevel analyzes were performed. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in waist circumference [beta 1.2 cm, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6-2.9], body weight (beta 0.3 kg, 95% CI -1.0-1.6 ), body mass index (beta 0.1 kg/m (2), 95% CI -0.3-0.5), pressure systolic blood pressure (beta 1.7 mmHG, 95% CI -2.4-5.8), diastolic blood pressure (beta 0.3 mmHG, 95% CI -1.0-0.6), cholesterol (beta 0 mmol /l, 95% CI -0.2-0.2), or indicators of quality of life after 18 months of follow-up.

1169,Long-term effects of asthma education for physicians on patient satisfaction and use of health services,"This randomized clinical trial evaluated the long-term impact of an interactive seminar for physicians based on the principles of self-regulation of physician behavior, children's use of health services for asthma, and parents' views on asthma. physician performance. Seventy-four general practice pediatricians and 637 of their asthma patients aged 1 to 12 years were randomized to treatment or control. Children and parents were unaware of physician involvement. Data were collected at baseline and at follow-up through self-administered surveys (paediatricians), telephone interviews (parents), and medical records. The seminar focused on the development of communication and teaching skills and the use of therapeutic medical regimens for asthma as outlined in the National Asthma Prevention and Education Program guidelines. Approximately 2 years after the intervention, physicians in the treatment group were more likely than control physicians to: use protocols to deliver asthma education (odds ratio [OR] 4.9, p=0.2), write for patients how to adjust medications when symptoms change (OR 5.7, p=0.05), and provide more guidelines to modify therapy (OR 3.8, p=0.06). Parents rated physicians in the treatment group higher than control physicians on five specific positive communication behaviors. Children seen by physicians in the treatment group had fewer hospitalizations (p = 0.03), and those with higher levels of emergency department (ED) use at baseline had fewer subsequent ED visits (p = 0, 03). No differences were seen in the number of office visits. No significant differences were found between treatment and control group physicians in the amount of time spent with patients during office visits (26 versus 29 min) or in the number of patients treated with anti-inflammatory medications. We conclude that interactive asthma seminars for pediatricians had significant long-term benefits for asthma care.",0,0,

METHODS: Prospective interrupted time series study evaluating the effectiveness of a multifaceted, staged intervention over 4 years in a major urban pediatric referral hospital. The guidelines for safe pediatric prescribing were implemented using an evidence-based model. Key components included early physician involvement and improved multidisciplinary communication, consensus building, interactive education, and timely data feedback through the use of iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The impact on medication error and harm (adverse drug events, [ADEs]) was measured using standard definitions and a multi-method approach. Prospective data from voluntary reports from nursing, medical, and pharmacist staff and intensive chart review were combined. All data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel, including causality assessments for ADEs. RESULTS: A total of 1,011 patients with 6,651 medication orders were reviewed over 3 time periods. Total ADEs decreased by >50% in the first year and this was maintained at 4 years. The greatest improvements occurred in potential ADEs, which decreased from 12.26 per 100 patients at baseline to 4.60 per 100 patients at 4 years (p < 0.05). Total medication errors decreased from 4.51 per 100 orders at baseline to 2.78 per 100 orders at 4 years (p < 0.05).

The gallbladder disease diagnosis was used to study its inter-exercise validity and consistency. The presence of an inflamed gallbladder containing gallstones is said to be easily recognized by certain signs on the lower lateral part of the iris of the right eye. Stereo color slides of the right eye were made. Stereocolor slides of the right eye of 39 patients with this disease and 39 control subjects of the same sex and age were made. Slides were presented in random order to five leading iridologists without additional information. The prevalence of the disease was estimated at 56%. The median validity was 51% with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 52%. These results were close to the validity of chance (iota = 0.03). None of the iridologists achieved high validity.

Methods A between-subjects and within-subjects experimental design with manipulations of CPI display formats. We enrolled both consumers with lower socioeconomic status (SES)/cognitive abilities and consumers with higher socioeconomic status (SES)/cognitive abilities, recruited through an online access panel. Respondents were given a fictitious CPI and completed questions about the interpretation and use of the information. Across subjects, we tested (1) showing an overall performance score (yes/no)""; (2) showing a small number of quality indicators (5 vs. 9);"" and (3) display different types of evaluative symbols (star ratings, colored dots, and word vs. number icons, and bar graphs). Within subjects, we tested the effect of a small number of health care providers (5 vs. 20). Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, and paired-samples t-tests. Results A total of 902 (43%) respondents participated. The display of an overall performance score and the use of colored dots and word icons especially enhanced consumer understanding. Importantly, respondents who received colored dots more often correctly selected the top three health care providers (84.3%), compared to word icons (76.6% correct), star ratings (70 .6% correct), numbers (62.0%) and bars (54.2%). by viewing the performance scores of 20 vendors. Additionally, a small number of health care providers seemed to help consumers, for example, when given 20 providers, 69.5% correctly selected the top three, compared to 80.2% with five providers. Discussion Particular display formats improved consumer understanding of CPI, most importantly the use of overall performance scores, colored word and dot icons, and a reduced number of providers displayed. Public reporting efforts should use these formats to maximize impact on consumers.",0,0,

To ensure safety in the health care system and create a strong radiation protection environment for patients (and employees), there must be a strong culture of safety. To understand the behavior, decisions, and actions of an organization, it is important to study its cultural values. The objectives of this study were to discuss how values, attitudes, and norms affect radiologists' decisions and how they influence the implementation of various radiation protection measures. To investigate this, in-depth individual interviews and focus group interviews were conducted in a sample of various radiology departments in hospitals in Sweden. The results show that the central value was derived from the patient's perspective with the focus on the knowledge that he or she has come to the health system for a particular reason: discovering a disease or, in the best of cases, declaring himself healthy. . The majority attitudes were based on experiences associated with aspects that the radiologist could not influence. This often refers to increased pressure on radiology investigations from clinics in the various operating units. Under the concept of standards, the radiologists in the study requested that the development of regulations and guidelines be connected to issues of justification for various radiological consultations.",0,0,

However, the commitment and competence of all stakeholders (patients, medical professionals, governments and funders) is required to achieve effective case management and ensure the ""shelf-life"" of recommended medicines. The health-seeking behavior of the patients and the practices of the health professionals for the management of malaria were evaluated. METHODS: This was an observational study embedded in a two-stage cluster random survey conducted at a health center (HC) in each of 12 selected health zones in the city of Kinshasa. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of malaria were eligible. Their health-seeking behavior was recorded in a specific questionnaire, as well as the practices of health professionals. The latter did not know that their practices would be evaluated. RESULTS: 624 patients were evaluated, of which 136 (21.8%) were under five years of age. Three hundred and thirty-five (55%) had taken medication prior to the current consultation (self-medication with some product or visiting another CS), of which 47 (14%) were taking some antimalarial, and 56 (9%) were presumptively treated . Among them, 53.6% received monotherapy with quinine, artesunate, phytomedicines, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, or amodiaquine. On the other hand, when clinicians were informed of laboratory results, monotherapy was prescribed in 39.9% of confirmed malaria cases. Only 285 patients (45.7%) were managed according to WHO and NMCP guidelines, of whom 120 (19.2%) were prescribed an ACT after a positive blood smear and 165 (26 .4%) did not receive antimalarials after a negative result. CONCLUSION: This study shows the discrepancy between malaria policies and the reality in the field in Kinshasa, regarding the health-seeking behavior of patients and the practices of health professionals. Consequently, poor policy enforcement can contribute to the genesis and spread of antimalarial drug resistance and also have a negative impact on disease burden.",0,0,

The Acute Coronary Syndrome Discharge Management project used a quality improvement approach, with specific intervention strategies to optimize: prescription of guideline-recommended medications; education on lifestyle modifications, including cardiac rehabilitation (CR); and communication between hospital staff, patients and general practitioners. Hospitals across Australia participated in a quality improvement cycle of audit, feedback, intervention and re-audit. Interventions included educational meetings, academic details and point-of-care reminders, and feedback of baseline audit results. Outcome measures included prescription of guideline-recommended medications, referral to CR, and management plan documentation and communication. At baseline, 49 hospitals recruited 1545 patients, and after intervention, 45 hospitals remained active in the study. project and recruited 1,589 patients. Three thousand and thirty-four hospital employees attended group education or academic sessions.

1187,Management of obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care,"OBJECTIVES: Obesity and overweight is the most powerful risk factor that represents 80-90% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The obesity epidemic is driving the diabetes epidemic to alarming levels and primary care is becoming an important arena for obesity management in T2DM in India. However, many primary care providers feel ill-equipped or inadequately supported to address obesity in patients with diabetes. This article reviews the latest and strongest evidence-based strategies that can help clinicians in managing obesity in patients with T2DM in primary care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE using the search terms Obesity, Obesity in T2DM, weight loss, and Primary Care. We also searched the websites of the American Diabetes Association, the National Institute for Health, the National Institute of Health and Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), and the World Health Organization. Most of the studies in this area have an observational design with few randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Articles and studies including meta-analyses or RCTs were preferred over other types.

OBJECTIVE: To describe barriers to the management of persistent pain among older adults, to summarize current management approaches, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities; present rehabilitation approaches; and highlight aspects of the doctor-patient relationship that can help improve treatment outcomes. This review is relevant to clinicians seeking an age-appropriate approach to providing pain care to older adults EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database from January 1990 to May 2014, using the terms search older adults, seniors, 65+, elderly, and elderly along with noncancer pain, chronic pain, persistent pain, pain management, intractable pain, and refractory pain to identify peer-reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, consensus statements and English-language guidelines relevant to the management of persistent pain in older adults. RESULTS: Of the 92 identified studies, 35 evaluated macologic interventions, while 57 examined nonpharmacologic modalities; ""the majority (n = 50) focused on in older adults with osteoarthritis.This evidence base supports a stepwise approach with paracetamol as a treatment of first line. If treatment goals are not achieved, it is recommended to try a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, tramadol, or both. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended for long-term use. Careful monitoring for toxicity and efficacy is essential, as advancing age increases the risk of adverse effects. A multimodal approach is strongly recommended, emphasizing a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to include physical and occupational rehabilitation, as well as cognitive behavioral and movement-based interventions. Ideally, an integrated pain management approach is achieved by cultivating a strong therapeutic alliance between the older patient and the physician. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment planning for persistent pain in old age requires a clear understanding of the patient's treatment goals and expectations, comorbidities, and cognitive and functional status, as well as coordination of community resources and family support. when available. A combination of pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and rehabilitative approaches, in addition to a strong therapeutic alliance between patient and physician, is essential to setting, adjusting, and achieving realistic therapeutic goals.",0,0,
1191,Management of severe hypertension in France in 1999 and 2000: intermediate results of a health insurance intervention program.,"OBJECTIVE: As part of its long-term public health program to improve the clinical management of hypertension (HTN), the French health funds conducted two nationwide surveys of members who were recently exempted from doing copays for severe hypertension. The objective was to measure the difference between the clinical management observed and the reference care, defined by the guidelines of the ANAES (National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health) of 1997, at the beginning (May 1999) and during the program (November 1999) to detect any change in clinical management between the two study periods, the time period corresponding to the intervention period. METHODS: The patient samples used in the two studies included members between the ages of 20 and 80 living in France or one of its overseas territories who were recently exempted from copayments (ETM) for severe hypertension (these patients are reimbursed 100% for all care related to the disorder). The evaluation was based on retrospective data provided by the treating physicians. The isolated indicators to compare the two study periods were blood pressure control, suggested lifestyle changes, and prescribed medications. RESULTS: The first survey was conducted between May and November 1999 and enrolled 10,665 patients (corresponding to a weighted patient population of 50,383), while the second surveyed 2,649 patients in November 2000. The study population in 1999 was, on average, younger than the study population in November 2000: 63.1 years +/- 0.2 vs. 65.4 years +/- 0.4. Almost two out of every three patients had at least one other major cardiovascular risk factor in addition to hypertension (smoking, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia): 63.9% in 1999 and 64.4% in 2000. Almost one patient out of seven had associated coronary disease: 14.1% in 1999 and 15.3% in 2000 and more than one in ten had associated cerebrovascular disease: 12.7% in 1999 and 12.2% in 2000. There were more diabetic patients in the 1999 group than in 2000: 27.5% +/- 1.0 vs. 23.9% +/- 1.6. The proportion of patients who had poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic > 140 mmHg or > 160 mmHg in subjects aged 60 to 80 years with isolated systolic hypertension, or diastolic > 90 mmHg) did not change: 46.8% +/- 1.1 in 1999 and 45.7% +/- 1.9 in 2000. If the recommendations of the guide for diabetics are applied (blood pressure < 130/85). 85.4% of diabetics were poorly controlled in 1999 and 86.6% in 2000. Likewise, in hypertensive patients with kidney failure (guideline recommendations: < 125/75 mmHg), 94.5% were poorly controlled in 1999 and 96.3% in 2000. Recommended Lifestyle changes (reduced salt intake, weight loss, decreased alcohol intake, increased physical activity) were not well followed in either studies: In 1999, fewer than one in four patients fully implemented the desired changes (23.7%), compared to only 24.5% in 2000. Physicians prescribed therapeutic agents specifically indicated considering associated diseases in the 68.0% of patients in 1999 and 67.6% in 2000. Prescriptions contained a potentially contraindicated drug in 27.3% of cases in 1999 and 28.0% in 2000. CONCLUSION: A comparison of the results of the two surveys carried out in 1999 and 2000 on the management of cap Patients with severe hypertension failed to demonstrate any significant difference in blood pressure control or treatment modalities. While they do not question the value of health fund interventions, these findings illustrate how difficult it is to change clinical practice in a short period of time, especially in a disorder that involves a number of different elements including, but not limited to, the individual patient behavior. To significantly improve clinical management, it will probably be necessary to continue the dialogue between the medical advisers of the health care funds (médecins conseils) and the doctors and to renew the campaigns aimed at helping patients to be more responsible.",0,0,
1192,Management of severe sepsis in patients admitted to Asian intensive care units: a prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES To assess the compliance of Asian intensive care units and hospitals with the resuscitation and management packages of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of compliance on mortality and the organizational characteristics of hospitals that were associated with increased compliance. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SCENARIO 150 intensive care units in 16 Asian countries. PARTICIPANTS 1285 adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to these intensive care units in July 2009. The organizational characteristics of the participating centers, the baseline characteristics of the patients, the achievement of the objectives within the resuscitation and management packages, and the results data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Compliance with the resuscitation (six hours) and management (24 hours) packages of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. RESULTS Hospital mortality was 44.5% (572/1285). Compliance rates for the resuscitation and management packs were 7.6% (98/1285) and 3.5% (45/1285), respectively. In logistic regression analysis, adherence to the following package goals independently predicted decreased mortality: blood cultures (achieved in 803/1285""; 62.5%, 95% confidence interval: 59.8% to 65.1%), broad-spectrum antibiotics (achieved in 821/1285; 63.9%, 61.3% to 66.5%), and central venous pressure (achieved in 345/870;"" 39.7% , 36.4% to 42.9%). High-income countries, university hospitals, intensive care units with an accredited fellowship program, and surgical intensive care units were more likely to be compliant with the resuscitation package. CONCLUSIONS Although mortality from severe sepsis is high, compliance with resuscitation and management packages is generally poor in much of Asia. Because the centers included in this study may not be fully representative, the reported performance rates may overestimate the true degree of adherence to recommended care and should be interpreted with caution. Achievement of blood culture, antibiotic, and central venous pressure goals were independently associated with better survival.",0,1,

1194,Management of agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in emergency situations,"INTRODUCTION: Patient agitation represents a significant challenge in the emergency department (ED), an environment in which medical personnel work under pressure to treat a wide range of medical emergencies. The potential for escalation into aggressive behavior, putting patients, staff, and others at risk, makes it imperative to address agitated behavior quickly and efficiently. Time constraints and limited access to specialized psychiatric support have in the past led to the ""monitor and sedate"" strategy, which was believed to represent the optimal approach"";"" however, it is increasingly recognized that more patient-centered approaches result in better outcomes. The aim of this review is to raise awareness of best practice for the management of agitation in the emergency department and to consider the role of new pharmacological interventions in this setting. DISCUSSION: The Best Practices in Assessment and Treatment of Agitation (BETA) guidelines address the complete management of agitation, including triage, diagnosis, interpersonal calming skills, and medication options. Since its publication in 2012, there have been new advances in pharmacological approaches to treating agitation, including new agents and new modes of administration, increasing the options available to both patients and clinicians. Newer modes of administration that may be helpful in rapidly controlling agitation include inhaled, buccal/sublingual, and intranasal formulations. To date, the only formulation administered non-intramuscularly with a specific indication for agitation associated with bipolarity or schizophrenia is inhaled loxapine. Non-invasive formulations, while requiring the cooperation of patients, have the potential to improve the overall patient experience, thus enhancing future cooperation between patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Management of agitation in the ED should encompass a patient-centered approach, incorporating nonpharmacologic approaches if feasible. When pharmacological intervention is necessary, a cooperative approach using non-invasive medications should be employed when possible.",0,0,
1195,Pain management in high-risk patients within a patient-centered medical home,"Chronic pain remains a major health problem despite remarkable advances in diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, and invasive and non-invasive interventions. The prevalence of chronic pain in the United States is staggering and continues to grow, and the personal and societal costs are not insignificant. The etiology of pain is complex, and people with chronic pain tend to have significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, substance use disorders. There is great concern regarding the increasing rate of misuse/abuse of prescription opioids, both for non-medical use and in patients with pain receiving chronic opioid therapy. While there is an ongoing debate about the ""true"" incidence of opioid abuse in the pain population, clearly, patients with both pain and substance use disorder are particularly challenging. Most patients with chronic pain, including those with co-occurring substance use disorders, are treated in the primary care setting. Primary care physicians have little time, resources, and training to effectively assess, treat, and monitor these complicated cases. A number of evidence-based and expert consensus-based treatment guidelines on opioid therapy and risk mitigation have been developed but have been underused in both specialist and primary care clinics. This article will discuss the use of new technologies and delivery systems for risk stratification, intervention, and follow-up of pain patients receiving opioids.",0,0,

1197,Manage perceived conflicts of interest while ensuring continued medical technology innovation,"Were it not for the ongoing collaboration between vascular surgeons and the medical technology industry, many of these advanced treatments used daily in interventional vascular surgery would not exist. The flip side of this coin is that these vital relationships create multiple roles for surgeons and must be managed appropriately. The dynamic process of innovation, coupled with factors such as product delivery technique refinement, education, testing and clinical trials, and product support, necessitate close and ongoing collaboration between surgeons and the surgery industry. the devices. This unique relationship sometimes leads to perceived conflicts of interest for clinicians, in part because the conflicting pressures of multiple and overlapping roles as clinician/caregiver/researcher/innovator/client are significant. To address this issue, the Association for Advanced Medical Technology (AdvaMed), the nation's largest medical technology association representing medical device and diagnostic companies, developed a Code of Ethics to guide medical technology companies in their interactions with health professionals. First introduced in 1993, the AdvaMed Code strongly encourages both industry and physicians to commit to openness and high ethical standards in the conduct of their business interactions. The AdvaMed Code addresses many of the types of interactions that can occur between companies and healthcare professionals, including training, consulting arrangements, provision of demonstration and evaluation units, and charitable donations. By following the Code, companies send a strong message that treatment decisions should always be based on the best interest of the patient.",0,0,

There are many therapeutic interventions available, however their effectiveness is not fully understood. For rehabilitation practice, the current question is how urinary incontinence (UI) can best be managed so that patients' daily lives are not compromised. METHOD: The search for clinical trials was carried out in PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library, restricted to articles in German and English published between 1989 and April 2005. Medical, nursing and physiotherapeutic interventions for the treatment of UI after stroke. RESULTS: Clinical trials were divided into process-oriented trials and those looking at individual interventions. The process trials can be divided into three different groups with an overall success rate of 82-95%, 50-56% and 23-36% respectively. Behavioral methods (caregiver-induced, patient-active, and other interventions) and medical interventions are available. The most successful group studies include staff education and the application of interventions based on an assessment procedure and guide. No clinical trial on individual interventions achieved an outcome like the process-oriented studies. CONCLUSION: For the treatment of urinary incontinence, a multimodal approach is necessary: special education of nurses, applying and acting in a problem-solving process, for example in the Rehabilitation Cycle and providing care based on an evaluation procedure and guidelines. . The development of a guideline for the management of urinary incontinence after stroke may be recommended. More research is needed on the efficacy of individual interventions.",0,0,

1200,Massachusetts General Practitioner Organization quality incentive program yields encouraging results,"Physicians are increasingly becoming salaried employees of hospitals or large medical groups. However, few published reports have evaluated provider-driven quality incentive programs for salaried physicians. In 2006, the Massachusetts General Practitioner Organization began a quality incentive program for its salaried physicians. Eligible physicians received performance targets for three quality measures every six months. Incentive payments could be as high as 2 percent of a doctor's annual income. Over thirteen six-month periods, the program used 130 different quality measures. Although improvements in quality of care and cost reductions were difficult to estimate, anecdotal evidence points to multiple successes. For example, the program helped physicians meet many federal criteria for meaningful use of health information technology and produced $15.5 million in incentive payments. The program also facilitated the adoption of an electronic health record, improved hand hygiene compliance, increased efficiency in radiology and the cancer center, and decreased use of the emergency department. The program showed that even small incentives tied to carefully structured metrics, priority setting, and clear communication can help change the behavior of salaried physicians in ways that improve the quality and safety of health care and ease the administrative burden felt by physicians. the doctors.",0,1,

Furthermore, in only 1 patient all risk factors were within the limits defined in several guidelines, which underlines the relevance of our initiative.",0,0,
1202,Maternal dietary intake and physical activity habits during the postpartum period: associations with medical advice in a sample of Australian new mothers.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous health benefits are associated with achieving optimal dietary and physical activity behaviors during and after pregnancy. Understanding the predictors of these behaviors is an important public health consideration, yet little is known about the associations between medical advice and diet and physical activity behaviors in postpartum women. The objectives of this study were to compare the frequency of dietary and physical activity advice provided by physicians during and after pregnancy and to assess whether this advice is associated with postpartum diet and physical activity behaviors. METHODS: New mothers (n = 448) enrolled in the Melbourne InFANT Extend trial completed the Cancer Council of Australia Food Frequency Questionnaire when they were three to four months postpartum, which assessed usual fruit and vegetable intake (servings /day). Total physical activity time, time spent walking, and time in moderate and vigorous activity during the previous week (min/week) were assessed using the Active Australia survey. Advice received during and after pregnancy was assessed using separate survey items, which asked whether a health professional had discussed eating a healthy diet and being physically active. Linear and logistic regression evaluated associations of advice with dietary intake and physical activity. RESULTS: Overall, 8.6% of the women met the combined fruit and vegetable intake guidelines. In general, the mean total time of physical activity was 350.9 +/- 281.1 min/week. The time spent walking (251.97 +/- 196.78 min/week) was greater than the time spent in moderate (36.68 +/- 88.58 min/week) or vigorous (61.74 +/- 88.58 min/week) activity. /- 109.96 min/week) and 63.2% of the women fulfilled the physical activity recommendations. Most of the women reported receiving advice on healthy eating (87.1%) and physical activity (82.8%) during pregnancy. Fewer women reported receiving advice on healthy eating (47.5%) and physical activity (51.9%) at three months postpartum. No significant association was found between provision of dietary and/or physical activity advice and maternal dietary intake or physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Less healthy diet and physical activity advice was received after pregnancy than during pregnancy, but no association between advice receipt and behavior was observed. More intensive approaches than provision of advice may be required to promote healthy diet and physical activity behaviors in new mothers.

We evaluated PLUS in a cluster-randomized trial of 203 participating physicians in Northern Ontario, comparing a full-service version (which included new article alerts and a cumulative alert database) with a self-service version (which included a guide to passive for evidence-based literature). Service utilization was the primary endpoint of the trial. Results: Mean library logins increased by 0.77 logins/month/user (95% CI: 0.43, 1.11) in the full-service group compared to the self-service group. . The proportion of full-service participants who used the service during each month of the study period showed a sustained increase during the intervention period, with a relative increase of 57% (95% CI: 12, 123) compared to the group self service. There were no differences in these proportions during the reference period, and after crossover from the self-service to full-service group, use of the self-service group became indistinguishable from the full-service group (relative difference 4.4 (95% CI -23.7 , 43.0).In addition, during the intervention and crossover periods, measures of self-reported utility did not show a difference between the 2 groups.Conclusion: An online literature service rated for quality and relevance increased the use of information based on in evidence: information from a digital library by practicing physicians.",0,1,
1204,Measures to assess practice change in physicians,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing number of randomized trials and systematic reviews examining the efficacy of interventions designed to bring about change in clinical practice. Findings from this research are being used to guide strategies to increase the acceptance of evidence in clinical practice. Knowledge of the outcomes measured by these trials is vital not only to the interpretation and application of the work done to date, but also to inform future research in this expanding area of effort and to aid in the collation of results in systematic reviews and meta-analysis. . METHODS: The objective of this review was to identify the methods used to measure the change in clinical practices of health professionals after an intervention aimed at increasing the acceptance of evidence in practice. All published trials included in a recent comprehensive Health Technology Assessment of interventions to implement clinical practice guidelines and change clinical practice (n = 228) formed the sample for this study. Using a standardized data extraction form, one reviewer (SH) extracted relevant information from the methods or results sections of the trials. RESULTS: Measures of a change in the behavior of health professionals were the most common, with 88.8% of trials using them as outcome measures. Measures that assessed change at the patient level, either actual measures of change or surrogate measures of change, were used in 28.8% and 36.7% of the studies (respectively). The knowledge and attitudes of health professionals were evaluated in 22.8% of the studies, and changes at the organizational level were evaluated in 17.6%. CONCLUSION: Most trials of interventions aimed at changing clinical practice measured the effect of the intervention at the practitioner level, that is, did the practitioner change what they did, or did they change their knowledge and/or attitude toward that practice? Less than a third of the trials measured, with or without changes in practice, resulted in a change in the patient's health status end point.",0,0,

1206,Implementation Persistence Measurement: QUERI Series,"As more quality improvement programs are implemented to achieve performance gains, the need to assess their lasting effects becomes increasingly apparent. However, such long-term follow-up evaluations are rare in health care implementation science, largely relegated to the ""need for more research"" section of most projects. This article explores the variety of conceptualizations of implementation sustainability, as well as the organizational and behavioral factors that influence the maintenance of gains. It highlights the finer points of design considerations and draws on our own experiences with sustainability measurement, framed within the rich theoretical and empirical contributions of others. In addition, recommendations are made for the design of sustainability analysis.

1207,Measuring the effectiveness of a collaboration for quality improvement in pediatric asthma care: does implementation of the chronic care model improve care processes and outcomes?,"Objective.—To examine whether a collaboration to improve pediatric asthma care positively influenced the processes and outcomes of that care. Methods. Medical record summaries and patient/parent interviews were used to make pre- and post-intervention comparisons of patients at 9 sites participating in the evaluation of a Breakthrough Series (BTS) collaboration in asthma care with patients at 4 sites paired control. . Setting.—Thirteen primary care clinics. Patients.—Three hundred and eighty-five asthmatic children who received care at an intervention clinic and 126 who received care at a control clinic (response rate = 76%). Intervention.—Three 2-day educational sessions for quality improvement teams from participating sites followed by 3 “action” periods over the course of a year. Results. The overall process of asthma care was significantly improved in the intervention group but was unchanged in the control group (+13% vs. 0% change in process score""; P < 0.0001). Patients in the intervention group were more likely than patients in the control group to control their peak flows (70% vs. 43%; P < .0001) and to have a written action plan (41% vs. 22% better general health-related quality of life (scale score 80 vs 77; P = 0.05) and asthma-specific quality of life related to treatment problems (scale score 89 vs 85 ; P < 0.05).Conclusions.â€”The intervention improved some important aspects of care processes that have previously been associated with better outcomes.Patients who received care at intervention clinics also reported better quality of life general and specific for asthma.",0,1,
1208,Measuring the Effectiveness of Mentoring as a Knowledge Translation Intervention to Implement Empirical Evidence: A Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND: Mentoring as a knowledge translation (KT) intervention uses social influence among health professionals to increase the use of evidence in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of mentoring as an AT intervention designed to increase the use of evidence by health professionals in clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using electronic databases (ie, MEDLINE, CINAHL), gray literature, and handsearching. Eligible studies evaluated mentoring of healthcare professionals responsible for patient care to improve acceptance of evidence in practice. Mentoring is defined as (a) a mentor with more experience than the mentee""; (b) individualized support based on the needs of the mentee""; and (c) involved in an interpersonal relationship as indicated by mutual benefit, involvement, and commitment. Two review authors independently screened citations for eligibility, extracted data and assessed study quality. Data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Of 10,669 citations from 1988 to 2012, 10 studies were eligible. Mentoring as a KT intervention was evaluated in Canada, the USA and Australia. Exposure to tutoring compared with no tutoring improved some behavioral outcomes (one study). Compared with controls or other multifaceted interventions, multifaceted interventions with mentoring improved practitioner knowledge (four of five studies), beliefs (four of six studies), and impact on organizational outcomes (three of four studies). There were mixed findings about changes in practitioner behaviors and the impact on physician and patient outcomes: some outcomes improved, while others showed no difference. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Only one study evaluated the effectiveness of tutoring alone as a KT intervention and showed improvement in some behavioral outcomes. The other nine studies evaluating the effectiveness of mentoring as part of a multifaceted intervention showed mixed results, making it difficult to determine the additional effect of mentoring. More research is needed to identify effective tutoring as a KT intervention.",0,0,
1209,Measuring the effects of reminders for outpatient influenza vaccines at the point of clinical opportunity,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of computerized influenza vaccination reminders on the behavior of individual physicians at each clinical opportunity. DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective study of physicians' influenza vaccination behavior over four years. About half of the physicians in an internal medicine clinic used a computer-based patient record system (CPR users) that generated computer-based reminders. The other clinicians used traditional paper records (PR users). MEASUREMENTS: Each non-acute visit of a patient eligible for an influenza vaccine was considered an opportunity for intervention. Patients who had contraindications to vaccination were excluded. Guideline compliance was defined as documentation that a physician ordered the vaccine, counseled the patient about the vaccine, offered the vaccine to a patient who declined, or verified that the patient had received the vaccine elsewhere. The authors calculated the proportion of times each clinician documented the action in the CPR and PR user groups. RESULTS: The CPR and RP user groups had different baseline compliance rates (40.1 and 27.9 percent, respectively""; ""P < 0.05). Both rates were stable over a two-year baseline period (P = 0.34 and P = 0.47, respectively). Compliance rates in the CPR user group increased 78 percent from baseline (P < 0.001), while rates for the RP user group did not change significantly (P = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who used reminder CPR had higher rates of documenting adherence to influenza vaccination guidelines than those who used a paper record. Measurements of individual clinical behavior at the point of each clinical opportunity can provide an accurate assessment of interventions that are designed to improve adherence to guidelines.",0,1,

1211,Medical care of type 2 diabetes mellitus in light of international and national recommendations: a retrospective analysis,"STUDY QUESTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a chronic disease with a great economic impact. In 2009, the Swiss Society for Endocrinology and Diabetes (SSED) published recommendations for the treatment of DM2. In Switzerland, few data are currently available on metabolic control and medical adherence to treatment guidelines. Our aim was to investigate clinical care in T2Dm in the year after the publication of the SSED recommendations. METHODS: We retrospectively studied the records of all DM2 patients admitted to our general internal medicine clinic during 2009. Metabolic control was judged from glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Antidiabetic therapy was discussed and the frequencies of target organ damage screening were investigated. A group with newly diagnosed T2D was analyzed separately from patients with known T2D at admission. RESULTS: In patients with known Dm2, the mean (+/- standard deviation) HbA1c level was 7.66% +/- 1.73%. Only 44% of patients had target HbA1c levels of 8.5%, the proportion of those treated with insulin increased from 49% on admission to 76% on discharge. Only half of the patients received a lifestyle intervention in the year before admission or during their hospital stay. Screening for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy was performed in approximately one-third and two-thirds of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of unselected DM2 patients admitted to our hospital, metabolic control was suboptimal. Implementation of treatment recommendations by both general practitioners and hospitals needs to be improved.",0,0,
1212,Medical technology and communication: a video-based process study on the use of decision aids in primary care consultations,"BACKGROUND: Much of the research on decision making in health care has focused on consultation outcomes. Less is known about the process by which doctors and patients make a treatment decision. This study aimed to quantitatively describe the behavior displayed by physicians and patients during primary care consultations when three types of decision aids were used to promote treatment decision-making in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A video-based study set up in an efficacy trial comparing the use of paper-based guidelines (control) with two forms of computer-based decision aids (implicit and explicit versions of DARTS II). The treatment decision referred to anticoagulation with warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation. 29 consultations were recorded on video. A ten-minute ""slice"" of the consultation was sampled for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocols for verbal behavior and ethological techniques for nonverbal behavior. RESULTS: The median consultation times (quartiles) differed significantly according to the technology used. The paper guidelines took 21 (19-26) minutes to work compared to 31 (16-41) minutes for the implicit tool and 44 (39-55) minutes for the explicit tool. decision point, GPs dominated the conversation, accounting for 64% (58-66%) of all statements and this trend was similar across all three arms of the trial.They did this at twice the rate compared to patients and higher rates in consultations involving computerized decision aids. GPs' language was very technically focused and only 7% of their conversation was socio-emotional in content;"" this was half of the socioemotional content displayed by the patients (15%). However, frequent head nodding and a close reflection in the direction of gaze suggested that both parties were active participants in the conversation. these queries. However, even in practices designed to promote shared decision-making, GPs were verbally dominant and worked primarily as providers of information to patients. In addition, computer-based decision aids significantly lengthened consultations, particularly in later phases. These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to greater 'participation' in treatment decision-making and that, in their current form, they may take too long to be negotiated for use in primary care. routine.",0,0,
1213,Medical diagnosis through semiotics: giving meaning to the sign,"Physicians are committed to incorporating quantitative methods for clinical decision making into their practices. A knowledge of semiotics, the doctrine of signs, can complement this project. A sign represents something. We communicate indirectly through signs, and by interpreting what the signs mean, we make sense of our world and diagnose and understand our patients. Thus, through association and inference, we transform flowers into love, Othello into jealousy, and staring eyes into thyrotoxicosis. Characteristically in diagnosis, beginning with a shaky inference, we test and otherwise ask questions that are likely to produce signs that support (or discredit) our hypothesis. In a literary sense, we join the author in clarifying and rewriting the text”; creative interpretation is the key. The diagnosis is concluded through the narration, by the meaning that is revealed by telling the patient's story. as long as we respect the principles and warnings of the interpretation of signs. The sign is both the key to the unknown and the main imitator. The sign and its meaning are generally not the same; the meaning has to be inferred. Because interpretations are made subjectively, they are circumscribed by the experience and bias of the clinician. Furthermore, the contexts in which the sign appears sign shape the meaning of the sign and can completely change it.",0,0,

1217,Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: physician and patient preferences and satisfaction,"Practice guidelines recognize the importance of patient preferences in determining the appropriate treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recent literature suggests that patient and physician perspectives and satisfaction with BPH treatment management may differ"";"" this may have an impact on clinical outcomes and patient compliance. This review assesses patients' and clinicians' preferred treatment options for managing BPH and patient satisfaction with therapy. A Medline-based systematic review using the terms ""benign prostatic hyperplasia"" + ""patient preference/perception/satisfaction"" or ""physician/urologist preference/perception"" was performed. Patients prefer therapies that affect long-term disease progression to those that provide short-term symptom improvement, which is in contrast to their physicians' beliefs. The prescribing behavior of urologists and primary care physicians can be very varied. Studies of patient satisfaction with specific treatments generally show a high level of overall satisfaction, but comparisons between studies are limited due to heterogeneity in study design. The evidence to date suggests that the opinions and beliefs of patients and those of their physician may not always agree. Better doctor-patient communication will help determine the best treatment option for patients with BPH and can ensure greater adherence and treatment success.",0,0,

In this article, we compare, contrast, and strive to find areas of alignment between the perspectives of three stakeholders: regulators, the biopharmaceutical and device industry, and US taxpayers. First, we discuss how HTE evidence is generated and how it could be improved. For pharmaceuticals, much of the initial research is conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, guided by basic science but also constrained by potential markets, regulatory approval requirements, trial size considerations, and payer expectations. as to evidence of value. Once a drug is marketed, further evidence can be generated by combining trial data, conducting meta-analyses, and analyzing real-world results through observational research designs"";"" we explore how these efforts can benefit from cooperation between these stakeholders. Second, we discuss the equally important utilization of HTE evidence for clinicians and patients to access and benefit from the learnings from this research. Research findings need to be translated into actionable information and guidelines that can be incorporated into daily practice. Doing so requires interaction and collaboration between all involved, based on facilitated communication, as well as further evaluation research. We provide examples of various cross-sector initiatives that are underway in this area. Finally, we explore some economic aspects of HTE research as part of the drug development, commercialization and treatment process. Understanding the economic incentives present is critical to aligning those incentives to improve the availability and utilization of HTE evidence. Clear understandings among regulators, pharmaceutical companies, and payers about high-value targets, methods for efficiently generating and communicating information, and value propositions can lead to ""win-win"" scenarios for patients, individual payers, the health care system as a whole, and the future. of drug development in the production of new drugs.",0,0,
1223,Menopause and exercise,"OBJECTIVE: Accumulating data suggests that regular physical exercise reduces mortality and prolongs functional life in men and women. This review seeks to describe the current state of the medical literature on this topic. METHODS: A narrative review of current medical literature including randomized clinical trials and clinical guidelines addressing the health benefits of physical fitness and regular exercise in postmenopausal and middle-aged women. RESULTS: The reduction and prevention of obesity and its related comorbidities (hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and heart disease) are one of the main benefits of exercise. However, long-term physical exercise is also associated with reduced rates of cancer, dementia, and cognitive decline, adverse mood and anxiety symptoms, and reduced osteoporosis, osteopenia, falls, and fractures. Beneficial physical activity includes exercise that will promote cardiovascular fitness (aerobic), muscular strength (endurance), flexibility (stretching), and balance (many of the above and additional activities such as yoga). CONCLUSIONS: Since it is unequivocally beneficial, inexpensive, and of minimal risk, maintaining a healthy exercise regimen should be a goal for every participant to improve lifelong well-being. Clinicians should use a number of behavioral strategies to support the fitness goals of their participants.",0,0,

METHODS: A pragmatic iterative design involved a literature review and focus groups followed by a formative evaluation that included reflection, questionnaires, and interviews. General practices and associated community mental health teams in South East London participated. Participants included community mental health workers, psychiatrists, nurses, general practitioners, managers, and local experts interested in primary mental health care. RESULTS: The shared care model includes the core components of improved communication along with the development of a registry and database with review and retrieval systems. Local needs assessment, auditing, training and guidance are complementary components. The intervention, Mental Health Link, is a facilitated quality improvement program that aims to accelerate service development by bringing teams together to agree on a shared care model appropriate to local needs, skills and interests, and supporting practice development. systems CONCLUSIONS: A shared care model must take into account the interdependencies of the components, as well as the relationship with the context.

The effect of dietary advice on long-term weight change is unclear. Objective: To perform a meta-analysis of the effect of dietary advice compared to usual care on body mass index (BMI) over time in adults. Data sources: First studies (1980 to 1997) of a previously published systematic review""; MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1997 to July 2006. Study selection: English-language randomized controlled trials (≥16 weeks in duration) in overweight adults reporting the effect of dietary advice on weight. The authors included only weight loss studies with a dietary component. Data extraction: Full data extraction was performed by individual reviewers;"" at least 1 additional reviewer reviewed the data. Data Synthesis: Random-effects model meta-analyses of 46 dietary advice trials revealed a maximum net treatment effect of 1.9 (95% CI, 2.3 to 1.5) BMI units (approximately 6%). at 12 months. Meta-analysis of changes in weight over time (slopes) and meta-regression suggest a change of approximately 0.1 BMI units per month from 3 to 12 months of active programs and a recovery of approximately 0.02 to 0 .03 BMI units per month during the following maintenance phases. Different analyzes suggested that calorie recommendations, frequency of support meetings, inclusion of exercise, and diabetes may be independent predictors of weight change. Limitations: Interventions, study samples, and weight changes were heterogeneous. Overall, the studies were of moderate to poor methodological quality. They had high rates of missing data and were unable to explain these losses. Meta-analytic techniques could not fully explain these limitations. Conclusions: Compared with usual care, dietary advice interventions result in modest weight loss that decreases over time. In future studies, emphasis should be placed on minimizing losses to follow-up and determining which factors result in more effective weight loss.",0,0,

A joint commission of the German Medical Association and the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians developed guidelines for substitution therapy for opioid dependence that were adopted by the board of the German Medical Association in March 2002 and published in Deutsche Arzteblatt on May 24. 2002. The present study is a systematic review of the scientific literature on treatment success in general, as well as on particular aspects of methadone substitution therapy considered by the guidelines of the German Medical Association. The literature is current as of January 2004. The oldest randomized controlled trials and the most recent quasi-experimental studies provide evidence that methadone maintenance therapy is an effective strategy for reducing illicit drug use, improving the health status of drug users, decrease criminal behavior and to promote the rehabilitation of people dependent on opiates. The evaluation of international studies clearly shows that the criteria for access to substitution therapy beyond the diagnosis of opioid dependence, for example, the presence of a life-threatening comorbidity, is not a prerequisite for substitution in other countries and, therefore, it is not discussed in the international community. literature. The evidence from the study shows that the German Medical Association guidelines for substitution therapy of opioid dependence reflect the best available evidence from scientific studies and apply it to conditions in the German healthcare system.",0,0,

For the experimental group, the date of the last mammogram ordered and recorded in the clinical database was printed on the encounter form generated for each patient visit. Information on prior mammograms was not printed for patients in the control group. Women in the experimental group were more likely to request a mammogram during the study period (19% vs. 12%, p = 0.001) and, as a result, were more likely to meet mammography guidelines at the end of the study ( 27% vs. 21%, p = 0.011).

Phase 2 was a 1-year period in which we implemented a thromboprophylaxis guideline using a) interactive multidisciplinary educational services; b) verbal reminders for the intensive care unit team; c) daily computerized record of thromboprophylaxis by nurses; d) weekly graphical feedback to individual intensivists on adherence to guidelines;"" and e) publicly displayed graphical feedback on group performance. Phase 3 was a 3-month follow-up period 10 months later, during which we documented thromboprophylaxis Computerized diary recording of thromboprophylaxis by the nurse continued during this period.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Mortality rates in the intensive care unit and in the hospital were similar in all phases, although patients in the phase 2 had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment II scores than patients in phases 1 and 3. The proportion (median % [interquartile range]) of patient-days in the heparin thromboprophylaxis intensive care unit in the phases 1, 2, and 3 was 60.0 (0, 100), 90.9 (50, 100), and 100.0 (60, 100), respectively (p = 0.01).The proportion (median % [range int erquartile]) of days during which heparin thromboprophylaxis was mistakenly omitted in phases 1, 2, and 3 was 20 (0, 53.8), 0 (0, 6.3), and 0 (0, 0), respectively (p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: After the development and implementation of an evidence-based thromboprophylaxis guideline, we found significantly more patients receiving heparin thromboprophylaxis. Adherence to the guideline was maintained 1 year later. More research is needed on what are the most effective strategies for implementing patient safety initiatives in the intensive care unit.",0,1,
1234,Incorrect prescribing of controlled substances: an evaluation of a professional development program,"BACKGROUND: The abuse of controlled prescription drugs (CPD) has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Most physicians who attend a 3-day continuing medical education (CME) professional development program (PDP) lack training in identifying risks and managing patients who misuse CPDs. To address this issue, the authors conducted an evaluation of a PDP that trains clinicians on appropriate prescribing, identification of substance abuse, use of screening tests, brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT), and implementation of motivational interviewing (MI). METHODS: The authors conducted a program evaluation to assess the efficacy and impact of the PDP on physicians' prescribing knowledge and behavior. RESULTS: Participants (N = 174) were typically middle-aged (mean age 53 years), male (89%), and physicians (82%) and other health professionals (18%). Many physicians practice alone in primary care settings (46%). Course evaluations were completed by n = 155 (89%) participants who rated the course and presenters highly (mean 4.8/5 respectively). Physicians' knowledge scores at pre- and post-assessments increased significantly: pretest (M = 58.7, SD = 13.12) and posttest (M = 78.28, SD = 9.83) (t( 173) = 20.06, P </= 0.0001, 95% confidence interval, CI: [-21.51, -17.65]). Almost half of the participants, n = 83/174 (48%), completed the follow-up survey and 93% agreed/strongly agreed (A/SA) that they made changes in professional practice. Of practicing participants with an active Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration (n = 57), the majority agreed/strongly agreed that they implemented changes to align their practices with current guidelines (89% ), used CPD more appropriately (87%), implemented changes in office prescribing policies (81%), identified and referred more substance abuse patients to treatment (80%), shared new information/course experience with 25 other health professionals (93%) and felt that the course had a positive impact on their behaviors personally and professionally (90% and 96%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study evaluating a PDP in this population. Results demonstrated participant satisfaction and improvement in prescribers' knowledge and self-reported prescribing behaviors. However, more studies are needed to assess the actual changes in clinical practice, the direct impact on patient outcomes, and relapse rates.",0,0,
1235,Mitigation of prenatal Zika virus infection in the Americas,"Background: Due to the risk of Zika virus infection in the Americas and the links between infection and microcephaly, other serious neurological conditions, and stillbirth, health ministries in the region have advised women to delay pregnancy . However, the effectiveness of this policy in reducing prenatal Zika virus infection has yet to be quantified. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of pregnancy delay policies on the incidence and prevalence of prenatal Zika virus infection. Design: Model of vector-borne Zika virus transmission adjusted to 2015-2016 epidemiological data on Zika virus infection in Colombia. Setting: Colombia, August 2015 to July 2017. Patients: Population of Colombia, stratified by sex, age and pregnancy status. Intervention: Recommendations to delay pregnancy by 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 months, at different levels of adherence. Measurements: Weekly and cumulative incidence of prenatal infections and cases of microcephaly. Results: With 50% compliance with the recommendations to delay pregnancy from 9 to 24 months, the cumulative incidence of antenatal Zika virus infections is likely to decrease by 17% to 44%, while it is likely to increase recommendations to delay pregnancy for 6 months or less antenatal infections by 2% to 7%. This paradoxical exacerbation of prenatal Zika virus exposure is due to an elevated risk of pregnancies shifting toward the peak of the outbreak. Limitation: Sexual transmission was not explicitly considered in the model due to limited data, but was implicitly included in the overall transmission rate, which was calibrated to observed incidence. Conclusion: Pregnancy delays can have a substantial effect in reducing cases of microcephaly, but they risk exacerbating the Zika virus outbreak if the duration is not sufficient. Careful consideration should be given to the duration of the delay, the adherence of the population, and the timing of the start of the intervention.

1236,Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study: Trial of a Personalized Treatment/Behavioral Communication Intervention for Blood Glucose Control,"BACKGROUND: National data finds glycemic control within target (A1c o = 7.5%) at baseline (n = 260) enrolled in study groups based on PCP randomization. All study patients receive blood glucose (BG) meters and a one-year supply of testing materials. Patients in three treatment groups select one of two mobile phone models, receive a one-year service plan and unlimited mobile data, sign up for the individual web-based patient portal, and receive treatment phone software of the study according to study allocation. Patients in the control group receive their usual care from their PCP. The primary outcome is the mean change in A1c over a 12-month intervention period. CONCLUSION: Traditional disease management methods have failed to achieve adequate control of blood glucose and other conditions important to people with diabetes. Tools to improve communication between patients and PCPs can improve patient outcomes and satisfy patients and physicians. This RCT is ongoing.",0,0,
1237,Mobile web application for self-management of low back pain: randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) is the diagnosis for people with back pain that does not have an underlying medical cause (eg, tumor, infection, fracture, herniated disc, spinal stenosis) . The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Pain Society (APS) recommend multidisciplinary treatments for NLBP lasting longer than 4 weeks. This approach, however, is impractical for many clinicians to implement, and relatively few providers offer NLBP treatment that meets the joint ACP-APS guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of a mobile web intervention called ""FitBack"" in helping users implement personalized strategies to manage and prevent occurrences of NLBP. METHODS: A total of 597 adults were recruited, screened, consented, and assessed online at baseline, 2 months (T2), and 4 months (T3). After initial assessments, participants were randomized into three groups: FitBack intervention, alternative care group that received 8 emails urging participants to link to six Internet resources for NLBP, and control group. The FitBack group also received weekly email reminders for 8 weeks, in addition to emails to take assessments. The control group was only contacted for evaluation. RESULTS: FitBack program users showed greater improvement compared to the control group in every comparison of critical physical, behavioral, and workplace outcome measures at 4-month follow-up. Additionally, users of the FitBack program performed better than the alternative care group on current back pain, behavior, and workplace outcomes at 4-month follow-up. For example, subjects in the control group were 1.7 times more likely to report current back pain than subjects in the FitBack group; subjects in the alternative care group were 1.6 times more likely to report current back pain at 4-month follow-up. Additionally, users of the FitBack program showed greater improvement compared to control and alternative care groups at 4-month follow-up in patient activation, Theory of Planned Behavior constructs, and attitudes toward pain. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that a theory-based independent mobile web intervention that tailors content to user preferences and interests can be an effective tool in self-management of low back pain. When viewed from the RE-AIM perspective (i.e., reach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance), this study supports the notion that there is considerable value in this type of intervention as a potentially cost-effective tool. that can ers of the people. The results are promising considering that the FitBack intervention was not supported by professional caregivers or integrated within a health promotion campaign, which could have provided additional support to participants. Still, more research is needed on how self-guided mobile web interventions will be used over time and to understand the factors associated with continued user engagement.

1238,Modeling of Gaze Patterns in Doctor-Patient Interaction with Delay Sequential Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether delay sequential analysis could be used to describe gaze orientation between physicians and patients in the medical encounter. This topic is particularly important as new technologies are implemented in multi-user healthcare environments where trust is critical and non-verbal cues are essential to building trust. This method of analysis could lead to design guidelines for more effective technologies and evaluations of interventions. BACKGROUND: Nonverbal communication patterns are important aspects of doctor-patient interactions and can affect patient outcomes. METHOD: The gaze behaviors of physicians and patients in 110 videotaped medical encounters were analyzed using the delay sequential method to identify meaningful behavioral sequences. Sequential analysis of delays included both event-based delay and time-based delay. RESULTS: The results of the event-based delay analysis showed that the patient's gaze followed the physician's gaze, while the physician's gaze did not follow the patient's gaze. Time-based sequential analysis showed that patient responses generally occurred within 2 s after the clinician's initial behavior. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the physician's gaze significantly affects the medical encounter, but that the reverse is not true. APPLICATION: The findings of this research have implications for the design of clinical work systems and the modeling of interactions. Similar research methods could be used to identify different patterns of behavior in clinical settings (physical layout, technology, etc.) to facilitate and evaluate clinical work system designs.",0,0,
1239,Referral facilitators with interpersonal counseling or pharmacological treatment in primary care patients with depression: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that depressive disorders are very common, there has been little research to guide primary care physicians on the choice of treatment for patients with mild to moderate depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of interpersonal counseling compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in primary care attendants with major depression and to identify moderators of treatment outcome. METHOD: A nine center randomized controlled trial (DEPICS, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Number: ACTRN12608000479303). The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode (defined as a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score </=7 at 2 months). Daily functioning was assessed using the Social and Occupational Adjustment Scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify moderators of treatment outcome. RESULTS: The percentage of patients achieving remission at 2 months was significantly higher in the interpersonal counseling group compared to the SSRI group (58.7% vs. 45.1%, P = 0.021). Five moderators of treatment outcome were found: depression severity, functional impairment, anxious comorbidity, prior depressive episodes, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: We identified some patient characteristics that predict a differential outcome with pharmacological and psychological interventions. If our results are confirmed in future studies, these characteristics will help clinicians define criteria for first-line treatment of depression targeting patient characteristics.",0,0,
1240,Modifying management of dyspepsia in primary care: an educational outreach cluster randomized controlled trial compared with passive guideline dissemination,"BACKGROUND: Quality improvement initiatives in health services are based on the effective introduction of clinical practice guidelines. However, even well-crafted guidelines have little effect unless they are supported by dissemination and implementation strategies. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of ""educational outreach"" as a strategy to facilitate the acceptance of dyspepsia management guidelines in primary care. STUDY DESIGN: A pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled trial of guideline introduction comparing educational outreach with postal guideline dissemination alone. SETTING: One hundred and fourteen general practices (233 general practitioners) in the Salford and Trafford Health Authority catchment area in North West England. METHOD: All practices received guidelines by mail in July 1997. Practices in the intervention group began receiving educational outreach three months later. This consisted of practice-based seminars with hospital specialists in which guideline recommendations were evaluated and implementation plans formulated. The seminars were followed by ""booster"" visits after another 12 weeks. Outcome measures were: (a) appropriateness of referral for ""; and (b) open access upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings; (c) costs of GP prescriptions for acid-suppressing medications , and (d) the use of laboratory serological tests for Helicobacter pylori.Data were collected for seven months before and/or after the intervention and analyzed by intention to treat.RESULTS: (a) The proportion of appropriate referrals was higher in the intervention group in the six months post-intervention-intervention period (practice medians: control = 50.0%, intervention = 63.9%, P < 0.05);(b) the proportion of important findings on endoscopy was not significantly altered; (c) there was a greater increase in total expenditure on acid-suppressing drugs in the intervention compared to the control group (+8% vs. +2%, P = 0.005);"" and (d) the median testing rate per practice for H pylori in the post-intervention period was significantly higher in the intervention group (four versus 0, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that educational outreach may be more effective than passive outreach in changing clinical behavior. It also demonstrates that unpredictable and unforeseen results can arise.",0,0,
1241,Modify angiotensin receptor blocker prescribing behavior by selectively rescinding administrative prior authorization requirements for losartan.,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether rescission of the prior authorization (PA) requirement (pre-approval) for losartan in a health maintenance organization (HMO) could reduce the prescription of more expensive angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). METHODS HMO physicians were notified that losartan would no longer require PA, and appropriate changes were made to the electronic prescribing software. The monthly distribution by medication of the number of ARB prescriptions filled to new patients was calculated before and after the policy change from data captured from electronic records. The proportion of patients (percentage and 95% confidence interval) treated with losartan who met the criteria for treatment with AIIRAs (hypertension or heart failure in patients who have developed adverse effects in response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or macroproteinuria) during the first month after PA requirement was rescinded. RESULTS The total number of PA requests for ARBs dropped by 48.6%, from 961 in December 2008, the month before the policy change, to 494 the following January, rising again to 651 during January 2010. Prescription incidence changed from 121 to 255 patients treated per month (114% increase) for losartan, from 15 to 16 (6.7% increase) for candesartan, and from 89 to 71 (20.2% decrease) for valsartan . The duration of effect of the decrease in ARB requests for the most expensive drugs was approximately 1 year. Only 23.3% (95% confidence interval 18.1–28.4) of patients who received losartan met the criteria for receiving ARBs. CONCLUSIONS Rescission of the PC requirement for this drug alone was an effective strategy of limited duration for reducing the prescription of relatively expensive drugs",0,1,
1242,Modular ICT-based patient empowerment framework for diabetes self-management: design insights and validation results,"INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that more than 382 million people suffer from diabetes worldwide, most of whom are between 40 and 59 years old. ICTs can play a key role in better diabetes control and patient empowerment. Patient empowerment engages patients more in their own healthcare process and disease management becomes an integral part of their daily lives. Self-management opens the possibility for patients to contribute to their own medical care and have greater control of their disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to explore the impact of an ICT-based patient empowerment framework on diabetes self-management. METHODS: A modular patient empowerment framework that encourages diabetes self-management was designed and implemented. The framework incorporates expert knowledge in the form of clinical guidelines and supports patients in specifying personalized activities that are based on medical recommendations and personal goals, and in collecting observations from daily life. The usability and usefulness of the proposed framework were evaluated in a pilot study with the participation of 60 patients and 12 health professionals. RESULTS: The study revealed that a patient empowerment approach based on self-management ICT tools is useful and accepted by both patients and physicians. For those patients who were already disciplined in managing their disease, the pilot solution served as a facilitator for data recording. Otherwise, it served as an incentive for better adherence to disease management principles. ICT tools prompted many patients to be more physically active and to make adjustments in their eating habits. However, this impact proved to be closely related to the sociocultural background of the subjects. The study also showed that even in patient-centered self-management interventions, clinicians still have a key role to play. However, the acceptance of such interventions by health professionals depends not only on the level of impact on their patients' disease management, but also on the level of impact on their workflow. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that a patient empowerment approach based on self-management ICT tools is useful and accepted by patients and physicians. In addition, there are clear indications that ICT frameworks such as the one presented in this paper support patients in behavioral changes and better disease management. Finally, it was perceived that self-care solutions should be built around the goal of not only educating and guiding patients in self-care of the disease, but also helping them explore the decision space and providing information and explanations about the impact of their own values in the decision.",0,0,
1243,"Molecular sources of residual cardiovascular risk, clinical signs and innovative solutions: relationship with subclinical disease, undertreatment and poor adherence: implications of new evidence on the optimization of cardiovascular outcomes in patients","Residual risk, the continuing appreciable risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid goals, remains a concern among cardiologists. Factors contributing to this ongoing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including other risk factors, inherent properties of statins, and patient characteristics. that is, genetics and behavior. In addition, providers, health systems, the community, public policies and the environment play a role. Major statin studies suggest an average 28% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of about 69%. Incomplete risk reductions and failure to ameliorate the conditions that create risk can result in continued progression of atherosclerosis, with new and recurrent lesions at original and distant culprit sites, remodeling, arrhythmias, rehospitalizations, invasive procedures, and terminal disability. As a result, the identification of additional agents to reduce residual risk, particularly given in conjunction with statins, has been an ongoing search. The current model of atherosclerosis involves many steps during which the disease can progress regardless of guideline-defined elevations in LDL cholesterol. Differences in genetic response to statin therapy, differences in the ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair itself, and differences in susceptibility to nonlipid risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes can create a residual risk. A large number of inflammatory and metabolic processes can also provide potential therapeutic targets to reduce residual risk. Classically, epidemiologic and other evidence suggested that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. When LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to targets, low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely related to MCVE. Efflux capacity, or the ability to relocate cholesterol away from macrophages, is thought to be an important anti-atherogenic mechanism responsible for the reduction of MCVE mediated in part by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiplatelet and vasodilator properties, among which is the protection of LDL against oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has an important effect on endothelial function. Additionally, HDL promotes endothelial repair and progenitor cell health, and supports nitric oxide production. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disease may fail to protect or even become proinflammatory or prooxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL cholesterol has not been beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, together with extensive preclinical information on the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the ""HDL hypothesis"", ie, raising HDL cholesterol per se will lower VEVM. After the equivocal AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study and the withdrawal of two important cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target adverse effects and the other due to lack of efficacy, continues the development of two other agents, that is, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which substantially reduce LDL cholesterol. The negative but controversial HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2-HDL Treatment to Reduce Incidence of Vascular Events) trial casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by experimental evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic actions of HDL. Non-HDL cholesterol reflects the cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B and has surpassed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. In addition to including a measure of residual risk, the advantages of using non-HDL cholesterol as the primary lipid target are now compelling. Reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, hypertension, and diabetes will help reduce residual risk. Although much improved, control of risk factors other than LDL cholesterol currently remains inadequate due to poor adherence to guidelines and poor patient adherence. More efficient and increased use of proven simple therapies, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers, combined with statin therapy, may be more fruitful in improving results than the use of other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multi-mechanistic, global and national programs that use primordial, primary and secondary prevention are necessary to reduce the total level of cardiovascular risk.",0,0,
1244,Monitoring and management of metabolic effects of antipsychotics: a cluster randomized trial of an intervention combining evidence-based quality improvement and external facilitation,"Background Treatment of psychotic disorders consists mainly of second-generation antipsychotics, which are associated with metabolic side effects such as overweight/obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend timely evaluation and management of these conditions; however, research studies show deficits and delays in metabolic control and management of these patients. This protocol article describes the Â®Monitoring and Management for Metabolic Side Effects of Antipsychotics,Â¯ project, which is testing an approach to implement recommendations for these practices. Methods/Design This project employs a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the efficacy of an evidence-based facilitation and quality improvement intervention. Eligible study sites were VA medical centers with 300 patients started on one new antipsychotic prescription within a six-month period. A total of 12 sites, matched in pairs based on scores on an organizational practice survey, were then randomly assigned in pairs to intervention or control conditions. Study participants include VA employees involved in metabolic monitoring and management of patients treated with antipsychotics at participating sites. The intervention involves researchers partnering with clinical stakeholders to facilitate the adaptation of local implementation strategies to address barriers to the control and management of metabolic side effects. The intervention includes a Design Phase (initial site visit and subsequent development of a local implementation plan); Implementation Phase (guided by an experienced external facilitator)"" and a Sustainability Phase. The evaluation includes components of interpretive, implementation-focused, progress-focused, and developmental formative evaluation, as well as summative evaluation. The evaluation methods include surveys, qualitative data collection from participating provider, and quantitative data analysis of data from all patients prescribed a new antipsychotic drug at a study site who are required to monitor or manage metabolic side effects during phases of the study. study Changes in recommended monitoring rates and management actions at intervention and control sites will be compared using time series analysis Discussion Improve control of metabolic side effects of antipsychotics as well as promote timely management based on evidence when these effects arise, will lead to better patient safety and long-term results.

BACKGROUND: Greater understanding of the concept of adherence is needed for the development of nursing interventions and nursing guidelines for patients with coronary heart disease. DESIGN. Cross-sectional, multicenter study. METHODS: This study was conducted from February to December 2013 with 416 patients with coronary artery disease 4 months after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess their adherence to treatment. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The theory explained 45% of adherence to a healthy lifestyle and 7% of adherence to medication. Structural equation modeling confirmed that motivation and care outcomes had the strongest association with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Responsibility was associated with medication adherence. Support from relatives, support from nurses and doctors, and motivation, cooperation, fear of complications, and a sense of normalcy were associated with adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients who are motivated to perform self-care and consider outcomes of care important were more likely to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Responsible patients were more likely to adhere to their medication. It is important to consider these elements as part of secondary prevention strategies among patients with coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.",0,0,

Objective: To determine whether motivational enhancement therapy with or without cognitive behavioral therapy improves glycemic control in type 1 diabetes compared to usual care. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: 8 diabetes centers in London and Manchester, UK. Patients: 344 adults with type 1 diabetes for more than 2 years, with hemoglobin A1c levels of 8.2% to 15%, and without complications or serious comorbid disease. Intervention: nurse-provided motivational enhancement therapy (4 sessions over 2 months), motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavioral therapy (12 sessions over 6 months), or usual care. Measurements: 12-month change in hemoglobin A1c levels (primary outcome), hypoglycemic events, depression, quality of life, fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes self-management activities, and body mass index x (secondary outcomes). Results: In an analysis that included all randomized patients, the 12-month change in hemoglobin A1c levels compared to usual care was 0.46% (95% CI, 0.81% to 0 .11%) in the motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavioral therapy group and 0.19% (CI, 0.53% to 0.16%) in the motivational enhancement therapy alone group. There was no evidence of treatment effects on secondary outcomes. Limitations: Of 1659 patients screened, only 507 were eligible and 344 participated. Data on the primary outcome were not available for 11.3% of participants. The study design did not allow us to distinguish the additive effect of cognitive behavioral therapy plus motivational enhancement therapy from the effect of greater intensity and duration of the combined intervention compared to motivational enhancement therapy alone. Conclusion: Motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy provided by nurses is feasible for adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Combination therapy results in a modest 12-month improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels compared with usual care, but motivation-enhancing therapy alone does not.",0,0,

It also has an impact on the quality of life of patients. In the stem cell transplant ward of a Swiss university hospital, patients are instructed according to current mouthwash guidelines and the condition of their mouth is assessed daily. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do patients experience oral mucositis and what factors influence their behavior to mouthwash regularly? METHOD: In this qualitative part of a concurrent nested mixed methods investigation, 14 patients were interviewed using an interview guide. The data was analyzed using content analysis methods. RESULTS: The results showed that oral mucositis cannot be viewed separately from disease, isolation, and care. Mucositis was only a heavy burden for patients with a severe occurrence. For patients with lesser-grade occurrences, other symptoms were more important. The research identified motivating and debilitating factors for regular mouthwashing, which is one of the most important preventive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how important it is to see oral mucositis in the transplant context and that knowledge about the motivating and hindering factors can help nurses in the care of patients. Improving patient self-control is a key aspect.",0,0,
1252,"Much cheaper, almost as good: decreasingly profitable medical innovation","Under conditions of limited resources, cost-saving innovations can improve overall results, even when they are slightly less effective than available options, by allowing for a more efficient reallocation of resources. The authors systematically reviewed all MEDLINE-cited cost-utility analyzes written in English between 2002 and 2007 to identify and describe cost- and quality-lowering medical innovations that might offer ""decreasingly"" favorable cost-effective trade-offs, defined as savings in minus $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year lost. Of 2128 cost-effectiveness ratios from 887 publications, only 9 comparisons (0.4% of the total) described 8 innovations that were considered to be decreasingly profitable. Examples included percutaneous coronary intervention (rather than coronary artery bypass grafting) for multivessel coronary disease, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rather than electroconvulsive therapy) for drug-resistant major depression, watchful waiting for inguinal hernias and the sterilization and reuse of the hemodialyzer. Per patient, these innovations generated savings of $122 to nearly $12,000 but losses of 0.001 to 0.021 quality-adjusted life years (approximately 8 hours to 1 week). These findings demonstrate the rarity of declining profitable innovations in the medical literature.",0,0,
1253,Multidimensional analyzes to assess relationships between clinicians' treatment options and patient characteristics: the example of COPD,"BACKGROUND: In some situations, practice guidelines do not provide robust evidence-based guidance regarding COPD treatment options, especially when large trials have failed to identify subgroups of particularly good or poor responders to available medications. METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study explored the performance of four types of multidimensional analyzes to assess associations between clinical characteristics of COPD patients and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments prescribed by lung specialists in a real-life setting. RESULTS: In total, 2494 patients were recruited by 515 respiratory physicians. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering identified 6 clinical subtypes and 6 treatment subgroups. Strong bidirectional associations were found between clinical subtypes and treatment subgroups in multivariate logistic regression. However, although the overall frequency of prescriptions varied from one clinical subtype to another for all types of pharmacological treatments, the clinical subtypes were not associated with specific prescription profiles. When canonical redundancy analysis was used, the proportion of variation in drug treatments explained by clinical characteristics remained modest: 6.23%. This proportion was higher (14.29%) for the non-pharmacological components of care. CONCLUSION: This study shows that, although pharmacological treatments for COPD are quantitatively very well related to the clinical characteristics of patients, there is no particular patient profile that can be qualitatively associated with prescriptions. This underlines the uncertainties perceived by clinicians in differentiating the respective effects of available pharmacological treatments. The methodology applied here is helpful in identifying areas of uncertainty that require further investigation and/or clarification of the guidance.",0,0,
1254,Multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric obesity: evaluation and nutritional management,"Methods of evaluation and treatment of pediatric obesity are rapidly evolving. Thought to be caused by an imbalance in caloric intake and expenditure, obesity requires a comprehensive evaluation of patient, family, environmental, genetic, and cultural characteristics so that clinicians can design successful interventions. Quantitative nutritional assessment of caloric intake is difficult and time consuming and should be used only in isolated settings, such as in the research setting, or if initial management approaches have been unsuccessful. Alternatively, providers should identify dietary patterns or behaviors that have been linked to obesity and are promising targets for change. Clinicians should tailor interventions based on the patient's and family's motivation and readiness to change. Current guidelines recommend gradual increases in treatment plans, and multidisciplinary treatment teams are recommended for patients who require intense intervention. Providers involved at a multidisciplinary level should incorporate their area of expertise into that of the team to develop a comprehensive management plan. This article reviews current recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of pediatric obesity with a focus on nutritional assessment as part of a multidisciplinary team.",0,0,
1255,Multifactorial influences and biases on the safety and quality of medication administration in the acute medical/surgical setting,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although numerous factors influence medication administration, our understanding of the interaction of these factors on medication quality and safety is limited. The aim of this study was to explore multifactorial influences on medication quality and safety in the context of a single verification policy for medication administration in intensive care. APPROACH: An exploratory/descriptive study using non-participant observation and follow-up interview was used to identify factors influencing medication quality and safety in medication administration episodes (n=30). Observations focused on nurses' interactions with patients during medication administration and the characteristics of the environment in which they occurred. Confirmation of the observed data occurred at the end of the observation period during short semi-structured interviews with the participating nurses. FINDINGS: Findings showed that nurses developed therapeutic relationships with patients in terms of assessing patients before administering medications and educating patients about drugs during medication administration. Nurses experienced more frequent distractions when medications were stored and prepared in a community medication room according to the room layout. Nurses deviated from best practice guidelines during medication administration. IMPLICATIONS: Nurses' skills and preparation to develop therapeutic relationships with patients increased the quality and safety of medications, thereby protecting patients from potential adverse events. Deviations from best drug administration practices had the potential to decrease drug safety. System factors, such as room layout that determines drug storage areas, can be easily addressed to minimize potential error. CONCLUSIONS: The nurses showed behaviors that increased the quality and safety of medication administration"";"" however, violations of practice standards were noted. These findings will inform future intervention studies to improve drug quality and safety.",0,0,
1256,Multifactorial intervention with nursing professionals does not change cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Strict implementation of multi-target guidelines reduces vascular risk in diabetic patients. It is not known if this also applies to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To assess this, the MASTERPLAN study randomly assigned 788 patients with CKD (estimated GFR 20 to 70 mL/min) to receive additional intensive skilled nursing support (the intervention group) or renal care (the control group). The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. During a mean follow-up of 4.62 years, modest but significant decreases in blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, anemia, proteinuria were found along with increased use of active vitamin D or analogs, aspirin, and statins in the intervention group. compared to controls. No differences were found in smoking cessation rate, weight loss, sodium excretion, physical activity, or glycemic control. Intensive control did not reduce the rate of the composite endpoint (21.3/1000 person-years in the intervention group compared to 23.8/1000 person-years in controls (hazard ratio 0.90)). No differences were found in the secondary outcomes of vascular interventions, all-cause mortality, or end-stage kidney disease. Therefore, the addition of intensive support by nurse practitioners in patients with CKD improved some levels of risk factors, but did not significantly reduce the rate of primary or secondary endpoints.",0,0,
1257,Multi-level support for physical activity and healthy eating.,"OBJECTIVE: This article reports on a study evaluating the relationship between social and community-level supports and physical activity and dietary behaviors among a low-income Latino population with multiple chronic conditions. BACKGROUND: With consistently lower physical activity than whites and documented nutritional deficiencies, Latinos in the United States of America represent a disproportionate share of the population with chronic disease. This pattern of health disparities is seen in every country, where there is a struggle to improve the health status of Aboriginal, immigrant, and low-income communities. Socioecological theories of healthy behavior highlight the importance of considering social and community support for healthy behavior and provide a useful framework for considering ways to improve physical activity and nutrition for immigrant and Aboriginal groups. METHOD: We present here data from an initial assessment of 200 patients from a health clinic in the United States of America serving a low-income, primarily Latino population. Participants were enrolled in Resources for Health, a randomized controlled trial to promote multilevel support for chronic disease self-management. Measures included self-reported physical activity, dietary behavior, and multilevel support for chronic disease management, as well as demographic data. Baseline data reported here were collected between February 2002 and September 2003. RESULTS: Use of multilevel supports (eg, family, individual, and health care provider) was statistically significantly associated with adherence to physical activity patterns and better eating habits. Being female and having multiple chronic diseases were also associated with better dietary behavior. These variables explained 20% of the variance in dietary behavior. CONCLUSION: The results support a socioecological approach to promoting healthy behavior in this low-income, primarily Latino sample with multiple chronic conditions. Addressing multiple levels of support for healthy behavior is important in interventions to improve physical activity and diet, and nurses may be particularly well placed to address these issues for low-income Aboriginal, immigrant, and chronically ill patients.",0,0,
1258,Multiple antipsychotic medication prescription patterns,"OBJECTIVE: To assess current prescribing practices regarding the concomitant use of antipsychotic medications and to summarize the reasons why clinicians may prescribe >1 scheduled agent. METHODS: Pharmacy identified patients at William R Sharpe Jr Hospital who are currently receiving antipsychotic therapy. All patients receiving >/= 2 concomitantly scheduled antipsychotic agents were included in the study. Data related to demographics, current drug combinations used, history of tried therapeutic regimens, and prescriber rationale were prospectively evaluated over a 60-day period beginning December 13, 2000, and ending February 10, 2001. Prescriber rationale for using >1 antipsychotic concurrently and other drug treatment regimens that had been tested were compared with documented medical records and published therapeutic guidelines for schizophrenia. RESULTS: During a 60-day surveillance period, 206 patients received scheduled antipsychotic medications, and 85 (41%) received at least 2 agents. Respondents to a questionnaire for prescribers (59%) indicated that the most common justification for combination therapy was augmentation"";"" the least likely reason was cross-titration. Survey responses also indicated a belief that there was questionable therapeutic benefit in more than half of patients treated with multiple antipsychotic combinations. Additionally, chart documentation showed that most of these patients did not receive an adequate trial of monotherapy with other atypical or typical agents, or clozapine prior to the combination antipsychotic regimen. Fifty-one percent of medical records did not document justification for concomitant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to a lack of published data, the practice of using multiple antipsychotic agents is considered a gray area that requires a higher level of awareness by the prescriber when evaluating effectiveness and safety. Documentation of the rationale, adverse effects, and response to the treatment regimen is essential to providing optimal patient care.",0,0,
1259,Multi-screen electronic alerts to increase venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in high-risk patients is frequently underutilized. Previously, we designed a one-screen computer alert program that identified hospitalized patients at high risk for VTE who were not receiving prophylaxis and advised their physicians to prescribe prophylaxis. Although this strategy reduced the incidence of symptomatic VTE at 90 days by 41%, most electronic alerts were ignored. We have now developed a serial three screen alert software designed to educate clinicians who initially refused to order prophylaxis after a single screen alert. Of a total cohort of 880, physicians responsible for 425 patients received a single electronic alert, while 455 who declined prophylaxis after the first screen received the second and third screens of the new three-screen alert. Our enhanced three-screen serial alert program generated VTE prophylaxis orders for 58.4% of the 455 patients whose physicians initially refused to order prophylaxis after the one-screen alert. There was no significant difference in the rates of symptomatic VTE at 90 days between the two cohorts (2.8% for the single test vs. 2.2% for the triple test, p = 0.55). We conclude that our three-screen computer alert program can markedly increase prophylaxis among clinicians who decline an initial single-screen alert.",0,1,
1260,Should diabetes be a deadly disease in Africa? Study of treatment costs,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the costs of diagnosing and treating diabetes in Tanzania. DESIGN Estimated costs from reported and recorded experience of patients with new-onset diabetes in 1989-1990 and of diabetic patients seen for the first time in 1981-2. SETTING Muhimbili Medical Center, Dar es Salaam. SUBJECTS 464 patients (315 men and 149 women). 262 patients diagnosed between September 1, 1989 and August 31, 1990 (group 1) and 202 between June 1, 1981 and August 31, 1982 (group 2). RESULTS The average annual direct cost of diabetes care in 1989-1990 was $287 for a patient who required insulin and $103 for a patient who did not. Insulin purchases accounted for 68.2% ($156) of the average annual outpatient costs for patients requiring insulin. For patients who did not require insulin, the cost of oral hypoglycemic agents and treatment of chronic complications and infections represented 42.5% ($29.3) and 48.8% ($33.7) of the costs, respectively. The cost of diabetic outpatient care for all of Tanzania was estimated at $2.7 million, of which *75,128 (32.2%) was for insulin. Physician and nurse costs accounted for 0.2% of the total cost of outpatient care. Direct annual hospital care costs were estimated at $1.25 million. About 0.2% of the Tanzanian population aged 15 and over used the equivalent of 8% of total government health spending, which was $47,4088,382. CONCLUSION Diabetes places a heavy strain on the limited resources of developing countries. If African diabetes patients have to pay for their treatment, most will not be able to and will die.",0,0,
1261,National Survey of Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention Practices in US Level I Trauma Centers.,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma implemented a requirement that Level I trauma centers must have a mechanism to identify patients who have a drinking problem and the ability to provide an intervention for patients with positive outcomes. Although the historic alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) mandate is anticipated to affect trauma practice across the country, a review of the literature revealed no studies that have consistently documented the pre-ACS requirement of SBI practice. . STUDY DESIGN: Trauma programs at all US level I trauma centers were contacted and asked to complete a survey on the ACS prerequisite trauma center SBI practice. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight of 204 (73%) Level I trauma centers responded to the survey. More than 70% of responding facilities routinely used laboratory tests (eg, blood alcohol concentration) to screen patients for alcohol, and 39% routinely used a standardized screening question or screening instrument. Screen-positive patients received a formal alcohol consultation or had an informal discussion about alcohol with staff members approximately 25% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation noted marked variability among Level I centers in the percentage of patients screened and in the nature and extent of intervention delivery in screen-positive patients. Following the ACS Committee on Trauma requirement, future research could systematically implement and evaluate training in the delivery of evidence-based alcohol interventions and training in building trauma center organizational capacity for sustained delivery. of SBI.",0,0,
1262,Naturopathic treatment for ear pain in children,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis media is one of the most frequent diseases of early infancy and childhood and one of the most frequent reasons for children to visit the doctor. In the last 2 decades, there has been a substantial increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least one episode of acute otitis media (AOM) before the age of 7 years. Ear pain is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children complain of ear pain or exhibit behavior that parents interpret as indicating ear pain. Treating ear pain early in the course of AOM decreases both parental anxiety and child discomfort and speeds the healing process. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic versus traditional treatment for the management of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. METHODS: The study was designed as a double-blind trial in a community outpatient clinic. A total of 171 children who were between 5 and 18 years old and had otalgia and clinical findings associated with middle ear infection were studied. The children were randomly assigned to receive treatment with naturopathic herbal extract (NHED) ear drops or anesthetic ear drops, with or without amoxicillin. At enrollment, children were assigned by computer numbered randomization to receive NHED (contains: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flowers, hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily, alone (group A) or together with a topical anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerin) 5 drops 3 times a day (group B), or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/d (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with NHED 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or topical anesthetic 5 drops 3 times daily (group D). A double-blind design was used and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (MS) evaluated and treated all patients included in the study and recorded all data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days with a visual analog scale. Ear pain was assessed using a specially designed observational instrument based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale, from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. The reverse contained a scale of 5 facial expressions, ranging from a wide smile (no pain) to a sad, tearful face (worst possible pain), and a corresponding color scale, ranging from blue to dark red. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the age or sex of the patients, the degree of fever, the main symptoms, the associated symptoms and the severity or laterality of the acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain within 3 days. Patients who received ear drops alone had a better response than patients who received ear drops together with amoxicillin. The results were better in the NHED group than in the controls. However, the findings indicated that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could simply be explained by time elapsed. Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Since we found no evidence that systemic antibiotics alone improved treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not change the natural course of otitis media, then the primary goal of treatment, as in the present study, should be pain relief. by ear Alternative medications, naturopathic herbal extracts, may offer many new possibilities in the treatment of ear pain associated with AOM. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried one or more forms of complementary/alternative medicine before coming to the practice. As widely reported in the medical literature, these herbs, these herbal extracts have the potential to meet all the requirements of appropriate medication that could be routinely used in the pediatric patient, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against common pathogens, immunostimulation ability, antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well absorbed with good penetration into the tissue surrounding the tympanic membrane. They have been found to enhance local immune activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well tolerated (because of their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the newer antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. Based on our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthesia) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we propose that sometimes the general practitioner or pediatrician needs to give the human body the opportunity to repair itself. However, if the doctor believes that some treatment is indicated, especially if the parents are anxious, then a local treatment such as the one used in our study may be adequate. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in cases of ear pain caused by AOM in children where active treatment is needed, in addition to a simple 2-3 day waiting period, an herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Concomitant antibiotic treatment does not appear to contribute.",0,0,

Little empirical evidence is available on the attitudes and values that underlie such decisions in different countries and cultures. Objective To explore the variability of attitudes of neonatal physicians across 10 European countries and the relationship between such attitudes and self-reported practice of end-of-life decisions. Design and Environment Survey carried out during 1996-1997 in 10 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania). Participants A total of 1,391 physicians (response rate, 89%) regularly employed in 142 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Main outcome measures Scores on an attitude scale, which measured opinions about the absolute value of life (score of 0) versus the value of quality of life (score of 10)"";"" self-report of ever setting limits on intensive neonatal interventions in cases of poor neurological prognosis. Results Physicians most likely to agree with statements consistent with preserving life at any cost were from Hungary (mean attitude scores, 5.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.9-5.5]), Estonia (4.9 [95% CI, 4.3-5.5]), Lithuania (5.5 [95% CI, 4.8-6.1]), and Italy (5.7 [95% CI, 5.3-6.0 ]), while physicians more in agreement that quality of life should be taken into account were from the United Kingdom (attitudinal scores, 7.4 [95% CI, 7.1-7.7 ]), the Netherlands (7.3 [95% CI, 7.1-7.5]), and Sweden (6.8 [95% CI, 6.4-7.3]) . Other factors associated with having a view in favor of quality of life were being female, not having had children, being Protestant or not having a religious background, considering religion not important, and working in a NICU with a high number of very low . -Newborns with birth weight. Physicians with scores reflecting a more quality-of-life view were more likely to report that their practice had set limits on intensive interventions in cases of poor neurological prognosis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI %, 1.3-1.7) per unit change in attitude score. Conclusions In our study, the likelihood that physicians report setting limits to intensive neonatal interventions in cases of poor neurological prognosis is related to their attitudes. After adjusting for potential confounders, country remained the most important predictor of physician attitudes and practices.",0,0,
1266,Neurobehavioral morbidity associated with sleep-disordered breathing in children: a comprehensive review.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review the research on the association between childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and neurobehavioral functioning. DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative review of the literature. SCENARIO: N/A. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: N/A. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Findings from 61 studies on the relationship between childhood SDB and neurobehavioral functioning were critically appraised and synthesized. There is strong evidence that childhood SDBs are associated with deficits in behavior and emotion regulation, school performance, sustained attention, selective attention, and alertness. There is also evidence that SDB has minimal association with a child's typical mood, expressive language skills, visual perception, and working memory. Findings have been insufficient to draw conclusions about intelligence, memory, and some aspects of executive functioning. The mechanisms by which RRT might cause neurobehavioral morbidity are being explored, but clinical symptoms, such as chronic snoring, remain the best predictors of morbidity. Short-term studies of RRT treatment outcomes are encouraging, but long-term results are unknown. Failure to treat SDB appears to leave children at risk for long-term neurobehavioral deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood RRT is associated with neurobehavioral morbidity. By applying commonly used guidelines for causal inference, even in the absence of a much-needed randomized clinical trial, there is strong evidence of association, consistent findings, and specificity of effect. There is suggestive evidence that this association fits the expected temporal pattern and that SDB is a biologically plausible cause of neurobehavioral deficits. Clinicians should be alert for the coexistence of RSD symptoms and concerns about the child's academic progress, attention, arousal, or regulation of behavior or emotions.",0,0,

DESIGN Population-based case-control study. SETTING Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital Research Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Newborn screening cards from 443 white cerebral palsy patients and 883 white controls were analyzed for enterovirus and herpesvirus viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction. Group A herpesviruses included herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV). -8) and group B herpesviruses included varicella zoster virus (VZV) and human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7). RESULTS The prevalence of viral nucleic acids in the control population was high: 39.8% of the controls were positive, and the prevalence was higher in preterm infants. Detection of herpes group B viral nucleic acids increased the risk of developing cerebral palsy (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.59).

1268,Never so old? Age should not be a barrier to enrollment in cancer clinical trials,"Across Europe and the US, more than 60% of the total incidence of cancer occurs in the elderly population (> or = 65 years), a group of patients that requires special consideration when making treatment decisions due to to a number of factors. Despite this, elderly patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials, so study data should be interpreted with caution because results in younger cancer patients may not always be extrapolated to the typical elderly cancer patient. . Reports suggest that elderly cancer patients represent about 22% of patients enrolled in phase II clinical trials. Barriers to accrual of elderly patients for clinical trials include lack of appropriate trials, high burden of comorbidity, restrictions imposed by the study, and clinician attitudes. There is a belief that elderly patients may be unable to tolerate various cancer therapies, which may result in this patient population being excluded from prospective trials. However, clinical data show that age alone is not a sufficient reason to discontinue treatment. The lack of clinical trial data and the associated lack of evidence-based guidelines for elderly patients means that clinicians have little to guide them, with the result that patients may not receive optimal therapy. Since clinical trials are the primary method for evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant and palliative cancer therapies, trials specifically targeting elderly cancer patients are required to adequately assess the risks and benefits of treatment in this vulnerable population. This review aims to assess the clinical reality and age mismatch of clinical trials to assess the implications for older cancer patients and to identify how this situation can be addressed. Possible reasons for the disparity and resulting clinical consequences are also considered.",0,0,

1271,New drugs in anesthesia: can we afford them?,"The most important challenge facing physicians today is the dilemma of providing high-quality care in a fiscally responsible manner. The cost can no longer be ignored. Pharmacoeconomics is a fundamental component of medical education. Economic issues must be an integral part of drug development and clinical trials. Although anesthesiologists are concerned that the use of less expensive medications may compromise patient outcome and satisfaction, there is little evidence to support such concerns. This is a fertile area for intense future research. Pharmacoeconomics is dynamic. Drug cost is not static, patterns of drug use change rapidly, and clinical practice is in a state of constant flux. The answer to cost containment is not simply to cut back, cap, delist, or simply hope for the best, but to manage and modify the practice as they adapt to changing needs. Educational programs, guidelines, departmental policies, system changes, and financial incentives can be implemented to ensure consistent and long-lasting adherence to the principles of pharmacoeconomics and value-based care. Some suggest that national societies should create guidelines for cost-effective practice. Others favor physician autonomy in drug selection. Changing physician behavior is difficult. This change will occur gradually and will be the subject of many emotionally charged philosophical debates. There will be a great reluctance to deny patients pharmacologically superior drugs based solely on cost, especially since drugs represent such a small portion of total costs. We must be careful to ensure that we do not become stingy and foolish. Drug acquisition costs are just one element in a large and complex equation. Focusing on the cost of purchasing medicines can be dangerous, even naive, if we are prey to knowing the cost of everything but the value of nothing.",0,0,

As it happens, in August, the Australian Center for Post-Traumatic Mental Health released the Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for ASD and PTSD. These have been endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The treatment described in the diver injury case is consistent with these guidelines. NHMRC guidelines suggest that immediately after a traumatic event (eg, diver death or serious injury), psychological first aid is the most helpful response. This includes providing information about traumatic stress reactions, encouraging self-care, and using available social support. It is recommended that the physician monitor the patient, noting improvement, plateau, or deterioration, and be ready to offer assistance or appropriate referral if necessary. The guidelines recommend the use of trauma-focused psychological therapy as a first-line intervention for ASD and PTSD. EMDR, including in vivo exposure, and CBT are considered the most effective treatments. If medication is required, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are considered the best option. For the benefit and convenience of patients and clinicians, the NHMRC guidelines and a comprehensive set of ASD and PTSD information guides are available online as pdf file downloads at http://www.acpmh.unimelb.edu .au. An update in the Medical Journal of Australia provides information on traumatic stress for clinicians, including screening questions that can be used to identify patients suffering from ASD and PTSD. This article is available online at: http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/187_02_160707/for10467_fm.html.

1279,No impact of active dissemination of the Ottawa Ankle Rules: further evidence of the need for local implementation of practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Local implementation strategies are often required to promote consistent adherence to clinical guidelines, but are time consuming and costly. The authors tested an educational intervention designed to increase use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules, a widely publicized set of clinical guidelines that had previously been shown to reduce the use of radiographs for the diagnosis of acute ankle injuries. METHODS: The study consisted of a quasi-experimental comparative analysis, before and after. Trained experts delivered 1-hour educational sessions and provided resource materials on the Ottawa Ankle Rules to healthcare professionals from 63 Ontario hospitals. Participants were asked to rate the intervention. The authors then compared, for the periods before and after the educational sessions, the use of ankle radiography for adults with acute ankle injury in 10 hospitals that received the educational intervention and did not report (n = 5) or some ( n = 5) previous use. standards and in 5 control hospitals, which declined the educational intervention because they were already implementing the standards. RESULTS: Although participants gave very positive ratings of the Ottawa Ankle Rules and the educational sessions, there was no reduction in ankle radiography use for the 10 hospitals that received the educational sessions (73% before and 78% after). intervention, p = 0.11). In contrast, the use of radiography decreased significantly, from 75% to 65%, in the 5 control hospitals (p = 0.022). INTERPRETATION: Even when a dissemination strategy is well received and involves a widely accepted clinical guideline, the impact on behavior in clinical practice may be small. In addition to wide dissemination, an active local implementation strategy is needed to encourage clinicians to adopt clinical guidelines.",0,0,
1280,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis in youth taking psychotropic medications: literature review, case reports, and management.","OBJECTIVE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a global epidemic due to the increased prevalence of obesity. Despite the implications for young people with severe mental disorders, little has been published in the psychiatric literature on this increasingly common medical comorbidity. The objectives of this article are: 1) to provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NAFLD, including progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)""; 2) to describe two clinical cases that illustrate the difficulties encountered in management; "" and 3) review screening recommendations, differential diagnosis, and follow-up and intervention approaches. METHODS: A review of the literature, including guidelines and recommendations, was conducted with case presentations that included case-control liver histology biopsy photographs. RESULTS: NAFLD in childhood and adolescence, as a precursor to NASH, progresses to fibrosis in a small percentage of young people, leading to risk of early-onset cirrhosis and the need for transplantation. The cases presented raise concerns that youth with serious mental health disorders, who are already at increased risk of obesity and its sequelae, may be at increased risk of progression to NASH, possibly due to higher rates of weight gain in addition to state of overweight or obesity, and to changes in the hepatic metabolism of psychotropic drugs that favor fat deposition. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rapid weight gain in the overweight or obese categories, or who develop elevated liver transaminase levels that persist for 3 to 6 months, should be evaluated or referred for screening by their psychotropic provider physicians. for early detection, diagnosis, and co-management by a pediatric gastroenterologist, to decrease the risk of progression to NASH, which is reversible if early and sufficient lifestyle change results in significant weight loss. There is an urgent need for controlled research on the relationships between weight gain, psychotropic medications, ultrasound and biopsy results, and rates of progression to NAFLD and NASH in youth taking psychotropic medications that induce weight gain. .",0,0,
1281,Noninvasive Imaging Predicts Failure Loading of the Spine with Simulated Osteolytic Defects,"BACKGROUND: Clinical management of lytic spinal tumors is currently based on geometric measurements of the defect. However, the mechanical behavior of a structure depends on both its material and its geometric properties. Quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were investigated as noninvasive tools to measure the material and geometric properties of vertebrae with a simulated lytic defect. From these measurements, yield loads were predicted using composite beam theory. METHODS: Thirty-four fresh-frozen cadaveric spines were segmented into functional spinal units of three vertebral bodies with two intervertebral discs at the thoracic and lumbar levels. Equally sized lytic defects were created in one of three locations: the anterior, lateral, or posterior region of the vertebra. Each column unit was scanned using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography, and axial and flexural stiffnesses were calculated from the image data. Each specimen was driven to failure under combined compression and forward bending, and the axial load and bending moment at yield were recorded. RESULTS: Although relative defect size was nearly constant, the measured yield loads had a large scatter, suggesting that defect size alone was a poor predictor of failure. However, the image-derived structural stiffness measures correlated moderately well with the measured yield loads. Furthermore, using composite bundle theory with computed tomography-derived quantitative stiffnesses, vertebral yield loads were predicted one-to-one (concordance, r(c) = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Although current clinical guidelines for predicting fracture risk are based on geometric measurements of the defect, we have shown that relative defect size alone does not explain variation in vertebral yield loads. However, composite beam theory analysis with quantitative computed tomography-derived stiffness measures can be used to prospectively predict yield loads of vertebrae with lytic defects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Image-predicted vertebral yield loads and analytical models that approximate the loads applied to the spine during activities of daily living can be used to calculate a fracture risk factor that clinicians can use to plan treatment or appropriate intervention.",0,0,

1283,Nonpharmacologic Therapies for Acute and Chronic Low Back Pain: An Evidence Review for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline,"BACKGROUND: Many non-pharmacological therapies are available for the treatment of low back pain. PURPOSE: To assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture, back schools, psychological therapies, exercise therapy, functional restoration, interdisciplinary therapy, massage, physical therapies (interferential therapy, low-level therapy). laser therapy, lumbar supports, shortwave diathermy, superficial heat, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasonography), spinal manipulation, and yoga for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain). DATA SOURCES: Studies in English were identified by searching MEDLINE (up to November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by handsearching reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews and randomized trials of one or more of the above therapies for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain) reporting outcomes of pain, specific back function, general health status, work disability or patient satisfaction. DATA EXTRACTION: We extracted information on study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To rate methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found good evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are all moderately effective for chronic or subacute low back pain (>4 weeks' duration). Benefits over placebo, sham therapy, or no treatment averaged 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analog pain scale, 2 to 4 points on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, or a standardized mean difference of 0.5 to 0.8. We found fair evidence that acupuncture, massage, yoga (Viniyoga), and functional restoration are also effective for chronic low back pain. For acute low back pain (<4 weeks duration), the only non-pharmacological therapies with evidence of efficacy are superficial heat (good evidence of moderate benefit) and spinal manipulation (fair evidence of small to moderate benefit). Although serious damage appeared to be rare, damage data was poorly reported. No trials have addressed the optimal sequencing of therapies, and methods for tailoring therapy to individual patients are still in early stages of development. Evidence is insufficient to assess the efficacy of sciatica therapies. LIMITATIONS: Our main source of data was systematic reviews. We included trials in languages other than English only if they were included in systematic reviews in English. CONCLUSIONS: Therapies with good evidence of moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute low back pain are cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation. . For acute low back pain, the only therapy with good evidence of efficacy is superficial heat.",0,0,
1284,Non-pharmacological management of hypertension: results of interviews with 100 general practitioners.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the type and level of non-pharmacological management offered by general practitioners for essential arterial hypertension. DESIGN: An open-ended, interviewer-administered survey using a standard case of a 60-year-old man with essential hypertension. Seventy interviews were conducted face-to-face and 30 by telephone. SETTING: Auckland General Practice. SUBJECTS: A random sample of 100 Auckland general practitioners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aspects of patient medical records, physical examination, laboratory tests, and treatments relevant to non-pharmacological management. RESULTS: There was a response rate of 84%. Most general practitioners reported that they offer non-pharmacological management at the first consultation before prescribing medications. However, few offered detailed programs. Most general practitioners suggested dietary therapy, restriction of alcohol consumption, and exercise. Restriction of sodium intake and behavioral therapy were less popular non-pharmacological interventions. The median number of patient visits to a general practitioner before medications were prescribed was five, which is in accordance with guidelines. The median number of days from the first visit to the prescription of pharmacological treatment was 42 (range 2-341). The clinical advice provided by most participants was consistent with current hypertension management guidelines, but the range of advice provided was wide. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that general practitioners are aware of non-pharmacological interventions for the management of hypertension. They report routine use of nonpharmacologic therapies for blood pressure reduction and other health benefits early in the clinical process before considering pharmacologic therapy. These non-pharmacological therapies are not delivered with well-defined and detailed programs.",0,0,

So far, the group has conducted 12 clinical trials, involving more than 2,500 patients, ranging from smaller phase II trials to large randomized phase III trials. At the time of writing, two randomized trials (comparing two doses of intravenous pamidronate and melphalan-prednisone (MP) versus MP-thalidomide in elderly patients) are ongoing. The group has striven for a simple organization with much responsibility delegated to regional coordinators (Denmark 3, Norway 5, Sweden 5). With regard to trial design, the group has considered it important that studies are based on sound scientific questions, are user-friendly for participants, population-based, investigator-initiated, include quality-of-life assessment, and health resources as endpoints, and can be used as the basis for various spin-off science projects. Like other clinical trial groups, the NMSG faces a number of challenges in the coming years. The financial situation of trials initiated by independent investigators is far from satisfactory, especially with regard to the resource-intensive implementation of stricter good clinical practice rules and ethics committee requirements. The NMSG has also found it increasingly difficult to recruit patients for recent trials, in part due to problems related to participating physicians (lack of support, laborious paperwork, insufficient credit for participation). Solutions to these problems must be found if industry-independent clinical trial groups are to survive.",0,0,

1289,Pushing guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing: a randomized clinical trial,"IMPORTANCE: ""Nudges"" that influence decision making through subtle cognitive mechanisms have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of applications, but there have been few experiments to improve clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of a behavioral 'nudge' based on the principle of public engagement to encourage the judicious use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial in 5 primary care outpatient clinics. A total of 954 adults had ARI visits during the study time period: 449 patients were treated by physicians randomly assigned to the published commitment letter (335 in the reference period, 114 in the intervention period)"";"" 505 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to standard practice control (384 baseline, 121 intervention). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of displaying poster-size commitment letters in examination rooms for 12 weeks. These letters, with photos and physician signatures, declared their commitment to prevent the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for ARIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescription rates for AKI diagnoses with inappropriate antibiotics in the baseline and intervention periods, adjusted for patient age, sex, and insurance status. RESULTS: Baseline rates were 43.5% and 42.8% for control and poster, respectively. During the intervention period, inappropriate prescribing rates increased to 52.7% for controls, but decreased to 33.7% in the published commitment letter condition. Controlling for baseline prescribing rates, we found that the published commitment letter resulted in a 19.7 absolute percentage reduction in the rate of prescribing inappropriate antibiotics relative to control (P = 0.02). There was no evidence of diagnostic coding switching, and appropriate antibiotic prescription rates did not decline over time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Displaying poster-sized engagement letters in exam rooms decreased inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The effect of this simple, low-cost intervention is comparable in magnitude to more expensive and intensive quality improvement efforts.

1290,Driving prescription decisions by partitioning the order set: results of a vignette-based study.,"Background Electronic health records (EHRs) are being rapidly adopted by healthcare professionals. Within EHRs, seemingly innocuous menu layout configurations can influence vendor decisions for better or worse. Objective The purpose of this study was to examine whether the grouping of menu items systematically affects prescribing practices among primary care providers. Participants We surveyed 166 primary care providers in a network of research practices in the Chicago metropolitan area, of whom 84 responded (51% response rate). Respondents and non-respondents were similar on all observable dimensions, except that respondents were more likely to work in an academic setting. Design The questionnaire consisted of seven clinical vignettes. Each vignette described typical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infections, and providers chose treatments from a menu of options. For each vignette, vendors were randomly assigned to one of two menu partitions. For inappropriate antibiotic vignettes, the treatment menu listed over-the-counter (OTC) medications individually while grouping prescriptions, or showing the reverse partitioning. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, the treatment menu listed narrow-spectrum antibiotics individually while grouping broad-spectrum antibiotics, or showed the reverse partitioning. Main measures The main outcome was provider choice of treatment. For inappropriate antibiotic vignettes, we categorized responses as either prescription drugs or over-the-counter-only options. For the appropriate vignettes for antibiotics, we classified the responses as either broad or narrow spectrum antibiotics. Key results Across all vignettes, there was an 11.5 percentage point reduction in the choice of aggressive treatment options (eg, broad-spectrum antibiotics) when aggressive options were pooled compared with when those same options were listed individually (95% CI 2.9 to 20.1%""; ""p?=?.008). Conclusions Provider choice of treatment appears to be influenced by menu option grouping, suggesting that the design of EHR order sets is not an arbitrary exercise. Careful crafting of EHR order sets can serve as an important opportunity to improve patient care without limiting physicians' ability to prescribe what they believe is best for their patients.",1,1,
1291,Pushing prudence? The effect of reminders on antibiotic prescriptions.,"Antibiotic resistance is a large and growing global health threat with significant consequences. The judicious use of antibiotics is vital to slow the spread of resistance. In this study I use a randomized controlled trial to test the effect on antibiotic use of reminders for primary care patients. The intervention was implemented in 31 clinics during the flu season in Stockholm. Two-level randomization was used, with randomization at the clinic level as well as at the individual patient level. With reminders, antibiotic use was reduced by 12.6 percent relative to control clinics. The effect is at the clinical level, suggesting that doctors or doctor-patient interactions, not individual patients, are affected. The results of a follow-up experiment further suggest that an effect on doctor-patient interactions is the main driver of the main results. Behavioral interventions targeting these interactions have the potential to reduce antibiotic use. However, more research is needed as control and adherence may also play a role.",0,1,

DESIGN Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING 186 general practices in the North West of England between February 2005 and May 2007. PARTICIPANTS 296 patients aged 18 years or older with ME/CFS (median disease duration seven years) diagnosed according to the Oxford criteria. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to pragmatic rehabilitation, supportive listening, or general medical treatment as usual. Both therapies were delivered at home in 10 sessions over 18 weeks by one of three adult specialist nurse practitioners who had received four months of training, including supervised practice, in each of the interventions. GP treatment, as usual, had no restrictions, except that patients were not to be referred for systematic psychological therapies during the treatment period. Main outcome measures The primary clinical outcomes were fatigue and physical functioning at the end of treatment (20 weeks) and 70 weeks from enrollment compared to usual treatment with general practitioners. Lower fatigue scores and higher physical functioning scores indicate better outcomes. RESULTS A total of 257 (87%) of the 296 patients who entered the trial were evaluated at 70 weeks, the primary outcome point. Analysis was by intention to treat, with robust treatment effects estimated after adjustment for missing data using probability weights. Immediately after treatment (at 20 weeks), patients allocated to pragmatic rehabilitation (n=95) had significantly improved fatigue (effect estimate -1.18, 95% confidence interval -2.18 to -0 .18""; P=0.021), but not physical functioning (-0.18, 95% CI -5.88 to +5.52; P=0.950) compared with patients assigned to treatment as usual (n One year after the end of treatment (70 weeks), there were no statistically significant differences in fatigue or functional physical activity between patients assigned to pragmatic rehabilitation and those in treatment as usual (-1.00, CI of 95%: -2.10 to +0.11, P = 0.076 and +2.57, 95% CI 3.90 to +9.03, P = 0.435). n=101) had poorer physical functioning than those assigned to treatment as usual (-7.54, 95% CI -12.76 to -2.33, P=0.005) and no difference in fatigue. 70 weeks, patients allocated to supportive listening did not differ significantly from those allocated to treatment as usual on any of the primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For ME/CFS patients in primary care, pragmatic rehabilitation provided by trained nurse practitioners improves short-term fatigue compared with unrestricted usual GP treatment, but the effect is small and not statistically significant at one year. of follow up.

1293,Nurse practitioners improve quality of care in chronic kidney disease: two-year results of a randomized study.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Here we assess whether strict implementation of multi-target guidelines with the help of nurse practitioners (NPs) improves management in patients with CKD. METHODS: MASTER PLAN is a randomized controlled clinical trial, conducted in nine Dutch hospitals. Patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20-70 mL/min) were randomized to receive PN support (intervention group (IG)) or medical care (control group (CG)). The patients were followed for a median of five years. The data presented is an interim analysis on the control of risk factors at two years of follow-up. RESULTS: We included 788 patients (532 F, 256 F), (393 CG, 395 IG), mean age (+/-SD) 59 (+/-13) years, eGFR 38 (+/-15) mL/min/ 1.73m(2), blood pressure (BP) 138 (+/-21)/80 (+/-11) mmHg. At two years, 698 patients (352 IG, 346 CG) could be analyzed. The IG compared to the CG had lower systolic BP (133 vs 135 mmHg; p= 0.04) and diastolic BP (77 vs 80 mmHg; p=0.007), LDL cholesterol (2.30 vs 2.45 mmol(-l );” p= 0.03) and increased use of ACE inhibitors, statins, aspirin, and vitamin D. The intervention had no effect on smoking cessation, body weight, physical activity, or sodium excretion . CONCLUSION: In both groups, the management of risk factors improved. However, changes in BP control, lipid management, and medication use were more pronounced in the IG than in the CG. Lifestyle interventions were not effective. Coaching by NPs thus benefits the daily care of CKD patients. Whether these changes translate into improvement in clinical endpoints remains to be established.",0,0,
1294,Nurse-led motivational interviewing to change the lifestyle of patients with type 2 diabetes (MILD project): protocol for a group randomized controlled trial on the implementation of lifestyle recommendations,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes in many patients is treated in general practice"";"" health care providers aim to promote healthy behaviors, such as a healthy diet, adequate physical activity, and smoking cessation. These measures can decrease insulin resistance, improve glycemic control, lipid abnormalities, and hypertension. They can also prevent cardiovascular disease and diabetes complications. However, practitioners do not optimally adhere to guidelines for lifestyle advice. Motivational interviewing to change the lifestyle of patients with type 2 diabetes aims to improve diabetes care in accordance with national guidelines for lifestyle counseling. Primary care nurses will receive training in motivational interviewing integrated into structured care in general practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the design and methods of a study evaluating the effects of nurse education on patient outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial involving 70 general practices (35 practices in the intervention arm and 35 in the control arm) from March 2007. A total of 700 patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited. 2. Patients in the intervention arm will receive care from the primary care nurse, who will be trained in an implementation strategy with motivational interviewing as a core component. Other components of this strategy will be the adaptation of the diabetes protocol to local circumstances, the introduction of a social map to support lifestyle, and educational and support tools to maintain motivational interviewing. The control arm will be encouraged to maintain usual care. The measures of effect will be the process of care, metabolic parameters (glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure and lipids), lifestyle (diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol), health-related quality of life and willingness of patients to change of behavior Measurements will be made at baseline and after 14 months. DISCUSSION: The application of motivational interviewing for patients with diabetes in primary care has been studied, but to our knowledge, no other study has yet evaluated the implementation and sustainability of motivating and engaging patients in daily diabetes care in general practice. If this intervention proves to be effective and cost-effective, large-scale implementation of this nurse-oriented intervention will be considered and anticipated.

1295,Nurse-led telephone outreach to improve lipids in people with diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Prospective randomized trials of case management interventions with resource utilization analyzes are needed. OBJECTIVES: To determine if algorithm-based telephone nursing care improves lipid control in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes at a federally funded community health center were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 381) or usual care (n = 381) groups. INTERVENTIONS: Nurses independently initiated and titrated lipid therapy and promoted behavior change through motivational interviewing and self-management techniques. Other parameters of diabetes care were addressed based on time constraints. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dl. Secondary outcomes included the number of hospital admissions, total hospital charges per patient, and the proportion of patients who met other guidelines for lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure. KEY RESULTS: The percentage of patients with LDL < 100 mg/dL increased from 52.0% to 58.5% in the intervention group and decreased from 55.6% to 46.7% in the control group (p < 0.01). The average cost per patient to the health system was lower for the intervention group ($6,600 vs $9,033, P = 0.03). Intervention patients tended to have fewer hospital admissions (p = 0.06). The intervention did not affect the results of blood glucose and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can improve lipid control in patients with diabetes in a primarily indigent population through telephonic care using moderately complex algorithms, but a more targeted approach is warranted. Phone-based outreach may decrease resource utilization, but more study is needed.",0,0,
1296,Nurses' evaluations on the use of CPOT at 12 months post-implementation in the intensive care unit,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend routine pain assessment for all intensive care unit (ICU) patients. As many ICU patients are unable to self-report, the Intensive Care Pain Monitoring Tool (CPOT) is one of two suggested behavioral pain scales for clinical use. Still, no study has described evaluations of its use in daily ICU practice. OBJECTIVE: To describe the nurses' evaluation of the feasibility, clinical relevance and satisfaction with the use of CPOT 12 months after its implementation in the ICU. METHOD: A descriptive design was used. It was carried out in the medical-surgical ICU of a university-affiliated setting in Greenfield Park (Quebec, Canada). ICU nurses, all trained to use the CPOT, completed a self-administered assessment questionnaire that included four sections (ie, feasibility, clinical relevance, satisfaction, and sociodemographic information). The questionnaires were completed anonymously. RESULTS: A total of 38 ICU nurses returned their completed questionnaire (63% participation rate). Regarding its feasibility, the majority rated the CPOT as quick to use, simple to understand and easy to complete (92-100%). Based on clinical relevance, about 70% of ICU nurses recognized that CPOT had influenced their practice, but lower results (<50%) were found for effective communication of pain assessment findings with physicians and other health professionals. More than 80% of ICU nurses were satisfied with its daily use. CONCLUSION: The use of CPOT was considered feasible and relevant in daily practice according to the nurses' evaluations, but it did not allow effective communication with other members of the ICU care team. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Training should be offered to all members of the ICU care team, and other implementation strategies should also be explored to ensure optimal adoption of a pain assessment approach that impacts their decision-making process. decision-making for pain management.",0,0,

BACKGROUND: Nurses work in many settings and with diverse clients. Certain clienteles have needs that require specific approaches, such as people who have an intellectual disability. The care offered to these patients can be influenced by the representations that the nurses who care for them have. Design. Descriptive qualitative study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews using thematic analysis were conducted with 18 nurses working in hospital and community settings. RESULTS: Nurses are concerned about their ability to recognize the specific nature and complex needs associated with patients' intellectual disabilities, promoting quality care by managing behavioral and communication challenges, as well as coping with the perception of lack of time and organization within the work environment. . Current strategies involve trying to promote continuity of care. Participants also identified their learning needs, which are relational and informational in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses are often aware of wanting to provide quality care to patients who have an intellectual disability, while acknowledging that there are many contextual and practical elements that require improvement to ensure the safety of these patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be educated to accommodate the findings emerging from current research showing that people with intellectual disabilities want to be part of their local communities and encourage these people to do so. This can be facilitated by adopting specific care guidelines, protocols and programs. More research is needed to develop a better understanding of the expectations of these patients and their caregivers, focusing on self-advocacy and health promotion techniques, with the aim of improving standards of personalized practice and reducing inequalities in health education for these patients.",0,0,
1299,Nursing strategies to address aspects of self-care related to medication adherence and symptom recognition in patients with heart failure: an in-depth look,"OBJECTIVE: Despite a growing body of knowledge about self-management in patients with heart failure, the need for effective interventions remains. We sought to deepen our understanding of the interventions that heart failure nurses use in clinical practice to improve patient adherence to medication and symptom monitoring. METHODS: A qualitative study with targeted content analysis was conducted, using data from a selected sample of Dutch-speaking heart failure nurses who completed two-vignette booklets on medication adherence and symptom recognition. RESULTS: Nurses regularly assess and reassess patients before deciding on an intervention. They assess basic/factual information and barriers in a patient's behavior, and try to find room for improvement in a patient's behavior. Interventions used by heart failure nurses to improve medication adherence and symptom control were grouped under the themes of increasing knowledge, increasing motivation, and providing practical tools to patients. Nurses also described the use of technology-based tools, increased social support, alternative communication, partnership approaches, and care coordination to improve medication adherence and symptom control. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong focus on educational strategies, nurses also reported other strategies to increase patient adherence.

At the professional level, codes, guidelines, and the Patient Bill of Rights address the issues of protecting the dignity, privacy, and autonomy of people who serve as research subjects. At the public level, regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services have become the standard for protecting human beings. At the private level, United States common law regulates the conduct of individual investigators by requiring them to act in a manner consistent with generally accepted standards of care. As professionals, nurses must actively participate in the formation of public policy regarding the conduct of research and strive to formulate a research agenda that ensures that the ethics of nursing research is above question.",0,0,

1302,"Nursing students' beliefs about smoking, their own smoking behaviors and the use of professional intervention for the treatment of smoking","As the largest group of healthcare professionals, nurses are in a unique position to influence their patients who smoke. They also have more contact with patients than any other provider. The purpose of this survey study was to describe nursing students' beliefs about smoking, their smoking behaviors, and the use of evidence-based smoking treatment interventions. Of 200 undergraduate nursing students surveyed, only 6% were smokers. The most inaccurate perception about smoking cessation treatment was that counseling of less than 3 minutes had no effect on improving smoking cessation rate. Eight percent of surveyed smokers reported that they provide anti-smoking treatment to all patients who smoke compared to 26% of non-smokers. Smoking-related morbidity and mortality justify the consistent use of clinical practice guidelines by nursing students and nurse practitioners.",0,0,

The Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Department of Health and Human Services","OBJECTIVES: The development of recommendations for physicians, nurse practitioners, and nutritionists to guide the evaluation and treatment of overweight children and adolescents. METHODS: The Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services convened a committee of experts on pediatric obesity to develop recommendations. RESULTS: The Committee recommended that children with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 85th percentile with complications of obesity or with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile, with or without complications, be evaluated and possibly treatment. . Physicians should be aware of the signs of rare exogenous causes of obesity, including genetic syndromes, endocrine diseases, and psychological disorders. They should detect complications of obesity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, orthopedic disorders, sleep disorders, gallbladder disease, and insulin resistance. Conditions that indicate consultation with a pediatric obesity specialist include pseudotumor cerebri, obesity-related sleep disorders, orthopedic problems, massive obesity, and obesity in children younger than 2 years. Recommendations for treatment evaluation included an assessment of the patient's and family's readiness to participate in a weight management program and a focused assessment of diet and physical activity habits. The primary goal of obesity therapy should be healthy eating and activity. The use of weight maintenance versus weight loss to achieve weight goals depends on each patient's age, baseline BMI percentile, and the presence of medical complications. The Committee recommended treatment that begins early, involves the family, and gradually institutes permanent changes. Parenting skills are the foundation for a successful intervention that implements targeted, gradual increases in activity and targeted reductions in high-fat, high-calorie foods. Continued support for families after the initial weight management program will help families maintain their new behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations provide practical guidance for pediatric clinicians evaluating and treating overweight children.",0,0,
1306,Observational Study of Telephone Consultations by Stroke Experts Supporting Administration of Tissue Plasminogen Activator in the Community,"OBJECTIVES: Barriers to the use of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke include the limited treatment experience of community physicians. Models of acute stroke care have been designed to address these limitations by providing community support. These include telephone or televideo support, with or without subsequent transport to tertiary care centres. The authors describe the frequency, characteristics, and effect of community telephone consultations to a 24/7 stroke ""hotline"" staffed by stroke physicians at an academic stroke center. strokes using that model. METHODS: Twelve intervention hospitals participating in the INcreasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Change Tactics (INSTINCT) trial were provided with a single access number (""hotline"") for expert consultation on tPA use. The experts consisted of physicians trained in stroke at an academic medical center. The use of the hotline was not mandatory in the study protocol, nor was patient transfer required. Consultants were asked to record all treatment questions in a web-based log. All patients discussed through the hotline and/or treated with tPA at an INSTINCT hospital underwent multi-level chart review by trained nurse coordinators. Cases were linked to recorded hotline calls, based on time of treatment and hospital of initial treatment. Medical judges evaluated the adequacy of tPA treatment, the presence of deviation from standard guidelines, and treatment complications (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], systemic hemorrhage, or death). RESULTS: Over 27 months, there were a total of 204 calls to the hotline regarding 116 patients. 91% of calls were made between 8 am and midnight, and 77% of questions explored eligibility issues for IV tPA, particularly for minor strokes or stroke improvement (26%). A total of 243 patients were treated with IV tPA at the 12 intervention hospitals, 54 of whom followed telephone consultations. Seventy-six percent of hotline patients recommended for tPA actually received tPA, while 2% of those not recommended for tPA received the drug. There were no differences in protocol deviations (27.8% hotline group vs 23.8% no hotline group), incidence of symptomatic ICH (5.6% vs 7.3%) or hospital mortality (5.6% vs. 13.2%). No medicolegal issues have been reported for any case in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Providing tPA decision support through telephone consultation to community physicians is feasible and safe. Consultants may play a more prominent role in determining tPA ineligibility than in acceptance. Future work should include a real-time survey of medical providers to determine the potential qualitative benefits of a stroke hotline.",0,0,
1307,Oncologists' Perspectives on Care for Rare Cancers: A National Survey,"PURPOSE: In response to the challenges and difficulties posed by rare cancers, multi-stakeholder initiatives dedicated to improving rare cancer care were launched, and several recommendations were made by professional societies. However, these primarily reflect the views of advocates and supporters, and may not represent the views of the ""average"" clinician or researcher. In this study, we sought to investigate perceived difficulties regarding rare cancer care and potential solutions supported by oncologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative sample of 420 oncologists recruited from 13 cancer centers participated in a nationwide survey. RESULTS: Oncologists faced several difficulties in treating patients with rare cancers, including lack of clinical practice guidelines (65.7%) and personal experience (65.2%), lack of approved treatment options (39, 8%) and refund issues (44.5%). . They generally supported recent recommendations from multi-stakeholder initiatives as well as professional societies for the development of clear clinical practice guidelines (66.0%), flexible reimbursement guidelines (52.9%), and a national registry of rare cancer (47.4%). However, there was only moderate support for referrals to high-volume centers (35.5%) and encouragement of unapproved treatments (21.0%). CONCLUSION: Insights into the general attitudes of oncologists gained through our national survey of representative samples would be useful in developing clinical practice and public health policy in rare cancer treatment and research.",0,0,
1308,Implementation of the 5A brief smoking cessation model by health professionals in oncology: patient perceptions,"OBJECTIVE: Health care providers (HCPs) can play an important role in promoting smoking cessation and relapse prevention. Public Health Service guidelines recommend the ""5A"" brief intervention model. The aim of the current study was to examine cancer patients' perceptions of the implementation of the 5A model by their oncology HCPs. METHODS: This study included 81 thoracic and 87 head and neck cancer patients at a large NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Patients completed questionnaires to assess perceptions of the implementation of the 5A's brief intervention model by their oncology professionals. RESULTS: The results indicate a partial implementation of the 5A model. However, most patients reported that their providers had asked them about smoking and advised them to quit"";"" only half reported that their interest in quitting had been assessed, and few reported smoking cessation assistance or follow-up. Delivery of the 5As was higher among patients who sought smoking cessation advice from their HCP. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest the need to increase adherence to 5As in the oncology setting. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to increase the provision of smoking cessation treatments by health professionals may improve the quit rate among cancer patients and ultimately translate into better long-term cancer treatment outcomes. term.",0,0,
1309,"One size? Mixed Methods Evaluation of the Impact of 100% Single Room Accommodation on Staff and Patient Experience, Safety, and Costs","Background and objectives There is little strong evidence regarding the impact of single room accommodation on the quality and safety of healthcare. We explored the impact of all single rooms on staff and patient experience, safety outcomes, and costs. Methods Mixed methods before/after 'move-in' comparison within four case study rooms nested in a single acute hospital with 100% single rooms; quasi-experimental before-and-after study with two control hospitals;"" analysis of capital and operating costs associated with individual rooms. Results Two-thirds of patients expressed a preference for single rooms with comfort and control that outweigh any disadvantage (feeling of isolation) felt by some. Patients appreciated the privacy, confidentiality, and flexibility of individual visitor rooms. Staff perceived improvements (patient comfort and confidentiality), but single rooms were worse in terms of visibility, vigilance, teamwork, monitoring, and patient safety. Staff walking distances increased significantly after the move. A temporary increase in falls and medication errors in a ward is likely to be associated with the need to adjust work patterns rather than with individual rooms per se. We found no evidence that single rooms reduced infection rates. A one-room hospital may cost 5% more to build with higher maintenance and cleaning costs, but the difference is marginal over time. Conclusions Staff needed to significantly adapt their work practices and did not feel ready for new ways of working with potentially significant implications for the long-term nature of teamwork. Staff preference remained for a combination of single rooms and bays. Patients preferred single rooms.",0,0,
1310,One-year outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatments for discogenic back pain: a community-based prospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The clinical entity ""discogenic back pain"" remains controversial at fundamental levels, including its pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and optimal treatment. This is true despite the availability of four randomized trials comparing the efficacy of surgical and non-surgical treatments. One trial showed benefits for lumbar fusion compared to unstructured non-surgical care, and three others showed more or less similar results for lumbar surgery and structured rehabilitation. PURPOSE: To compare the outcomes of community-based surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with chronic back pain attributed to degeneration at one or two lumbar disc levels. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients presenting with axial back pain to academic and private practice orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in a large metropolitan area. OUTCOME MEASURES: Roland-Morris back disability score (main outcome), current rating of overall pain severity on a numerical scale, back and leg pain bother measures, the Physical Function Scale of Questionnaire 36 short form version 2, pain medication use, employment status, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and additional surgery. METHODS: Patients who received spinal surgery within 6 months of enrollment were designated as the ""surgical treatment"" group and the remainder as ""nonsurgical treatment."" Outcomes were evaluated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. RESULTS: We enrolled 495 patients with discogenic back pain who presented for initial surgical consultation at the offices of 16 surgeons. Eighty-six patients (17%) underwent surgery within 6 months of enrollment. Surgery consisted of instrumented fusion (79%), disc replacement (12%), laminectomy or discectomy (9%). Surgical patients reported more severe pain and physical disability at baseline and were more likely to have had prior surgery. Adjusting for baseline differences between groups, surgery showed a limited benefit over non-surgical treatment of 5.4 points on the Modified Roland Disability Questionnaire (23 points) (main outcome) 1 year after enrollment. Using a composite definition of success that incorporates a 30% improvement in Roland score, a 30% improvement in pain, no use of opioid analgesics, and work (if applicable), the 1-year success rate was 33 % for surgery and 15% for non-surgical. treatment. The reoperation rate was 11% in the surgical group"";"" the surgery rate after treatment appointment in the non-surgical group was 6% at 12 months after enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical group showed greater improvement at 1 year compared with the nonsurgical group, although the composite success rate for both treatment groups was fair. The results should be interpreted with caution because the results are short term and treatment was not randomised. Only 5% of non-surgical patients received cognitive behavioral therapy. The non-surgical treatment received by the patients was variable and the majority did not comply with the main guidelines.",0,0,
1311,Continuous supply of individual physician performance data improves practice behavior,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines summarize the evidence from science and attempt to translate those findings into clinical practice. Widespread and consistent adoption of these guidelines in providers' daily practice has been slow. METHODS: Using compliance with postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis (PONV) guidelines as our metric, we compared the effects of continuing medical education (CME) alone (I), CME with a single snapshot of provider compliance (II). and ongoing provider reporting. compliance data without further CME (III). We retrospectively analyzed guideline compliance for 23,279 anesthetics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Compliance was defined as a patient with 1 risk factor for PONV receiving at least 1 antiemetic, 2 risk factors receiving at least 2 antiemetics, and 3 risk factors receiving at least 3 antiemetics. Drugs in the same class were counted as single antiemetic administration. Anesthetic techniques based on propofol were counted as receiving 1 antiemetic. Patients with 0 risk factors for PONV were not included. We estimated compliance rates for each of the 4 study time periods by adjusting for multiple observations from the same physician. Individual performance feedback was provided once at 6 months after intervention I coinciding with a PONV update presentation (start of intervention II) and quarterly during intervention III. RESULTS: Compliance rates were not significantly influenced by CME (intervention I) compared to baseline behavior (54.5% vs. 54.4%, P = 0.9140). There was a significant improvement over the time period when CME was matched to performance data (Intervention II) compared to Intervention I (59.2% vs. 54.4%, P = .0002) . There was a further significant improvement when data were presented alone (intervention III) compared to intervention II (65.1% vs 59.2%, p < 0.0001). For patients with 3 risk factors, we observed a significant improvement in compliance rates during intervention III (P = 0.0002). In the post hoc analysis of overtreatment, the percentage differences between baseline and time period III decreased as the number of risk factors increased. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the greatest improvement in adherence to guidelines with continuous feedback on personal performance. Provider feedback can be an effective tool for changing clinical practice, but it can have unintended consequences.",0,1,
1312,Online interventions for social marketing health behavior change campaigns: a meta-analysis of psychological architectures and adherence factors.,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online interventions that encourage people to reduce their alcohol consumption, increase their exercise, and better manage their weight. Motivations for developing eHealth interventions may be driven by reach, interactivity, cost-effectiveness, and Internet studies showing that online interventions work. However, when designing online interventions suitable for public campaigns, few evidence-based guidelines exist, taxonomies are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and previous meta-analyses are not applicable to large-scale public campaigns targeting the voluntary behavior change. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis evaluated online intervention design features to inform the development of online campaigns, such as those employed by social marketers, that seek to encourage voluntary health behavior change. Another objective was to increase understanding of the relationships between intervention adherence, study adherence, and behavioral outcomes. METHODS: Based on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 query terms in 5 bibliographic databases with additional gray literature searches was used. This resulted in 1,271 abstracts and articles; 31 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 29 articles describing 30 interventions were included in the main meta-analysis, and the additional 2 studies qualified for compliance analysis. Using a random effects model, the first analysis estimated the overall effect size, including groupings by control conditions and time factors. The second analysis evaluated the impacts of psychological design features that were coded with taxonomies from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive technology, and other fields of behavioral influence. The systems were integrated into a coding framework model called the Communication-Based Influence Component Model. Finally, the third analysis evaluated the relationships between intervention adherence and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: The overall impact of online interventions across all studies was small but statistically significant (standardized). mean difference effect size d=0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.11-0.28, p<0.001, number of interventions k=30). The greatest impact with a moderate level of efficacy was exerted by online interventions compared to waiting lists and placebos (d = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.17-0.39, p < 0.001, k = 18), followed by the comparison with those with less technology. online interventions (d=0.16, 95% CI=0.00-0.32, p=0.04, k=8); no significant difference was found compared to sophisticated print interventions (d=-0.11, 95% CI=-0.34 to 0.12, p=0.35, k=4), although online interventions offer a small effect with the advantage of lower costs and greater reach. Time turned out to be a critical factor, with shorter interventions generally achieving higher impacts and better adherence. By design, most interventions were based on the transtheoretical approach and were goal-oriented, deploying numerous influencing components aimed at showing users the consequences of their behavior, helping them achieve goals, and providing normative pressure. Inconclusive results suggest a relationship between the number of influencing components and the effectiveness of the intervention. Despite a conflicting correlation, evidence suggests that study adherence, intervention adherence, and behavioral outcomes are correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that online interventions have the ability to influence voluntary behaviors, such as those often targeted by social marketing campaigns. Given the high reach and low cost of online technologies, the stage can be set for increased public health campaigns that combine interpersonal online systems with mass media reach. Such a combination of approaches could help people achieve personal goals that, at the individual level, help citizens improve the quality of their lives and, at the state level, contribute to healthier societies.",0,0,
1313,"Operations Research as Implementation Science: Definitions, Challenges, and Research Priorities","Background Operations research (OR) is the discipline of using models, either quantitative or qualitative, to aid decision-making on complex implementation problems. Operating room methods have been used in health care since the 1950s in a variety of areas, such as emergency medicine and the interface between acute and community care""; hospital performance; visit scheduling and management patients' home visits; scheduling patient appointments""; and many other complex implementation issues of an operational or logistical nature. Discussion To date, there has been limited debate about the role of operations research in implementation science. I detail three such roles for OR, all based on early systems thinking: structuring implementation problems, prospective evaluation of improvement interventions, and strategic reconfiguration. Case studies from mental health, emergency medicine, and stroke care are used to illustrate each role. I then describe the challenges for applied OR within implementation science at the organizational, interventional, and disciplinary levels. Two key challenges include the difficulty faced in achieving a position of mutual understanding between implementation scientists and research users and a marked lack of evaluation of OR interventions. To address these challenges, I propose a research agenda to assess applied OR through the lens of implementation science, freeing OR from the specialized research and consulting environment, and co-designing models with service users. . Abstract Operations research is a mature discipline that has developed an important volume of methodology to improve health services. OR offers implementation scientists the opportunity to think more about the system up front before committing resources or taking risks. OR has three functions within implementation science: the structuring of an implementation problem, the prospective evaluation of implementation problems, and a tool for the strategic reconfiguration of health services. Challenges facing OR as an implementation science include limited evidence and impact evaluation, limited engagement of service users, lack of managerial awareness, effective communication between research users and OR modelers, and availability of care data. medical. To advance the science, a focus on three key areas is needed: evaluation of OR interventions, incorporation of OR knowledge into health services, and education of OR modelers on the goals and benefits of user engagement. from service.",0,0,

Most respondents noted the relevance of ethics in different medical situations, although in certain areas, such as community health and animal research, ethical issues were considered less important. Patients' inability to follow up regularly and illiteracy were considered to be the main limitations to obtaining consent. Opinion about the amount of information to be imported to research participants as part of informed consent differed from standard guidelines. Physicians who reported taking an orientation course in medical ethics and those with prior research experience were more aware of ethical issues.

Despite the availability of numerous treatment regimens, hypertension remains inadequately controlled and only a small proportion of patients reach target BP levels. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. The main determinants include the implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not allow patients to reach the goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely recognized that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve target BP"";"" however, clinicians may be reluctant to employ such treatment strategies.

1320,Optimizing Hypertension Management with Combination Therapy: Considerations for the Nurse Practitioner,"Hypertension is a major contributor to the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but success in achieving blood pressure (BP) control has been limited. Most patients will require 2 or more medications to control their blood pressure. Nurse practitioners play a vital role in treating patients with hypertension and can help overcome barriers to achieving BP goals. Measures to improve therapeutic adherence include educating the patient and simplifying the medication regimen. The use of single-pill combination therapy, which reduces pill burden, may help improve medication persistence and adherence. Rational combination therapy combines drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor"";"" it is often more effective than monotherapy and allows the use of lower doses of the individual components, generally resulting in better tolerability. Current guidelines support the first-line use of combination therapy in many patients. Starting treatment with an RAAS inhibitor-based combination can lower BP and cardiovascular risk and may be more effective for some patients than traditional combinations, such as a beta-blocker with a diuretic. Adverse events associated with any medication may compromise its therapeutic usefulness. Peripheral edema is a common and dose-dependent adverse event seen with dihydropyridine CCBs, which can cause significant patient distress, reduce adherence to therapy, and result in dose reduction or even reversal. interruption of therapy. In most cases, CCB-induced peripheral edema can be successfully controlled and discontinuation of CCB therapy is not necessary.

Key suggestions include the following: All patients should be asked about their smoking status at each visit, and all smokers should be encouraged and helped to quit. The decision to prescribe an oral contraceptive requires a detailed personal and family history of thrombotic disease. Lipid profile measurement, along with exercise and dietary intervention, should be considered for smokers >35 years of age who use or request oral contraceptives. Patients older than 35 years who are heavy smokers (>15 cigarettes/day) should be denied the use of oral contraceptives.

To determine if a computerized decision support system could increase the proportion of orders for oral quinolone antibiotics for hospitalized patients. Design. Prospective analysis of interrupted time series. Around. Teaching hospital in the southeastern United States. Subjects. Inpatient orders for quinolones placed from February 1, 2001 to January 31, 2003. Intervention. On February 5, 2002, a web-based intervention was implemented as part of an existing order entry system at a university hospital. Based on an automated query of active medications and dietary requests, some users requesting intravenous quinolones were suggested to consider choosing an oral formulation. Main outcome measure. The proportion of inpatient quinolone orders placed for oral formulations before and after intervention deployment. Results. There were a total of 15,194 orders for quinolones during the study period, of which 8,962 (59%) were for oral forms. Orders for oral quinolones increased from 4,202 (56%) before the intervention to 4,760 (62%) after, with no change in total orders.

1324,Orbital/periorbital plexiform neurofibromas in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: multidisciplinary recommendations for care,"TOPIC: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant condition, manifest a variety of ophthalmologic conditions. Plexiform neurofibromas (NPs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can cause significant visual loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause a significant alteration in physical appearance secondary to proptosis, ptosis, and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and decreased self-esteem. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease requiring routine eye examinations, there are no formal recommendations for the clinical care of children with OPPN. Although medical and surgical interventions have been reported, there are no agreed criteria for when OPPNs require therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome. METHODS: Because management decisions are directed by a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics, pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and neuro-oncology), the absence of a uniform outcome measure representing visual or cosmetic sequelae complicates treatment design. evidence. based studies and feasible clinical trials. RESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force, comprised of pediatric physicians from tertiary care centers with experience caring for children with OPPN, was convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines for children with OPPN. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for ophthalmologic management, describes treatment indications and upcoming biologic therapy, and discusses the challenges of conducting clinical trials in this complicated condition.",0,0,
1325,Organization of surveillance in GI practice,"BACKGROUND: Several reports documented inefficient use of available resources, as well as suboptimal compliance with surveillance recommendations. Although evidence suggests that organizational issues can influence the quality of care provided, surveillance protocols are generally based on unorganized approaches. METHODS: We conducted a literature search (publication date: 01/2000-06/2016) in PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to obtain guidelines or consensus statements for practice surveys, patient information reports, or provider attitudes and behaviors, for intervention studies to improve guideline adherence. Related articles were also analyzed. Based on the clinical relevance and burden on endoscopy services, this review focused on surveillance for Barrett's oesophagus, IBD, and post-polypectomy surveillance for colonic adenomas. RESULTS: Existing guidelines generally acknowledge the structure and process requirements that influence the delivery of surveillance interventions, while less attention has been paid to transitions and interfaces in the process of care. Available evidence from practice surveys suggests the need to design organizational strategies aimed at enabling patients to attend and providers to provide timely and appropriate care. However, well-designed studies evaluating the effectiveness of specific interventions in this setting are lacking. Indirect evidence from screening settings would suggest that implementation of automated standardized retrieval systems, use of clinical records, removal of financial barriers, could improve appropriateness of use and adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of solid evidence on the usefulness and methodology of surveillance may help explain the observed variability in provider and patient attitudes and adherence to recommended surveillance.",0,0,
1326,Organizational theory for the dissemination and implementation of research,"Background Even under optimal internal organizational conditions, implementation can be undermined by changes in organizations' external environments, such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in hiring practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in guidance and practice recommendations clinical or other environmental changes. . Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in implementation frameworks, but nuanced explanations of how organizations' external environments influence implementation success are lacking in implementation research. Organizational theories offer implementation researchers a wealth of extant, highly relevant, and as yet largely untapped explanations of the complex interplay between organizations and their environment. In this article, we demonstrate the usefulness of organizational theories for implementation research. Discussion We applied four well-known organizational theories (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, contingency theories, and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice to prevent abuse and neglect. childish. Transaction cost economics theory explained how the frequent and uncertain processes for contracting SafeCare may have created inefficiencies and thus compromised implementation among private child welfare organizations. Institutional theory explained how child welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare because doing so aligned with the expectations of key stakeholders within the professional communities of child welfare systems. Contingency theories explained how efforts such as collaborative interagency teams promoted SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to the internal and external contexts of child welfare agencies. Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) explained how interagency relationships, supported by contracts, memorandums of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare implementation by balancing autonomy and dependency on funding agencies and SafeCare developers. . Summary In addition to the retrospective application of organizational theories demonstrated above, we advocate the proactive use of organizational theories to design implementation research. For example, implementation strategies should be selected to minimize transaction costs, promote and maintain consistency between the organizations' dynamic internal and external contexts over time, while addressing the organizations' financial and financial needs. preserve their autonomy. We describe the implications of applying organizational theory in implementation research for implementation strategies, evaluation of implementation efforts, measurement, research design, theory, and practice. We also offer guidance to implementation researchers in applying organizational theory.",0,0,
1327,Education for the prevention of osteoporosis: behavioral theories and calcium intake,"Osteoporosis is a global health problem. The prevention of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures has become a goal of many health professionals, especially dietetic professionals. However, few prevention models have proven effective. The goal of this project was to determine whether a theory-based osteoporosis prevention education program would have a significant impact on calcium intake. This project used a convenience sample of 42 women who participated in an 8-week educational intervention, similar to a community class. The program included practical activities to increase self-efficacy and was based on the Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). The main outcome measures were calcium intake and the TRA and Health Belief Model constructs. Significant changes in health belief model and TRA constructs after intervention included higher perceived susceptibility to osteoporosis (p < 0.001), perceived benefits of increasing calcium intake (p < 0.001), and higher self-efficacy related to calcium intake (p < 0.001). /=.003). Statistically significant regression equations were found for all calcium-related preintervention intentions.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial nested within a baseline cross-sectional survey of body mass index (BMI). Randomisation and outcome measurement, but not participants, were blinded to group assignment. SETTING 45 family practices (66 general practitioners) in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 3,958 children who visited their general practitioner between May 2005 and July 2006 were surveyed for their BMI. Of these, 258 children aged 5 years 0 months to 10 years who were overweight or obese according to the International Obesity Taskforce criteria were randomized to intervention (n=139) or control (n=119) groups. Children who were severely obese (UK BMI z-score > or = 3.0) were excluded. INTERVENTION Four standard consultations over 12 weeks targeting change in nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, supported by specifically designed family materials. Main outcome measures The primary measure was BMI at 6 and 12 months after randomisation. Secondary measures were 7-day accelerometry mean activity count/min, 4-day food frequency abbreviated diary nutrition score, and infant health-related quality of life. Differences were adjusted for socioeconomic status, age, sex, and baseline BMI. RESULTS Of 781 eligible children, 258 (33%) entered the trial; attrition was 3.1% at 6 months and 6.2% at 12 months. The adjusted mean differences (intervention - control) at 6 and 12 months were, for BMI, -0.12 (95% CI -0.40 to 0.15, P=0.4) and -0.11 (-0.45 to 0.22, P=0.5); for physical activity in counts/min, 24 (-4 to 52, P=0.09) and 11 (-26 to 49, P=0.6);"" and for nutrition score, 0.2 ( -0.03 to 0.4, P=0.1) and 0.1 (-0.1 to 0.4, P=0.2).

DESIGN Cluster randomized trial nested in a population-based survey. SETTING Three local government areas in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Parents who attended controls of healthy 12-month-olds over a six-month period completed a baseline questionnaire. At 18 months, children at or below the 20th percentile on an expressive vocabulary checklist entered the trial. INTERVENTION Maternal and child health centers (groups) were randomized to either intervention (modified 'You make a difference' program for six weekly sessions) or control ('usual care') arms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was expressive language (Preschool Language Scale-4) at ages 2 and 3; secondary outcomes were receptive language at 2 and 3 years, Vocabulary Checklist raw score at 2 and 3 years, Expressive Vocabulary Test at 3 years, and Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 raw score at 2 years. and 3 years RESULTS 1,217 parents completed the baseline survey, 1,138 (93.5%) completed the 18-month checklist, when 301 (26.4%) children had vocabulary scores at or below the 20th percentile and were randomized (158 intervention, 143 control). 115 (73%) intervention parents attended at least one session (mean 4.5 sessions), with most reporting high satisfaction with the program. Intermediate outcomes at 2 years of age were similar in Similarly, at age 3 years, the adjusted mean differences (intervention-control) were -2.4 (95% confidence interval -6.2 to 1.4, P = 0.21) for expressive language; -0.3 (-4.2 to 3.7, P = 0.90) for receptive language; 4.1 (-2.3 to 10.6; P=0.21) for a list control list; -0.5 (-4.4 to 3.4, P=0.80) for the expressive vocabulary test; -0.1 (-1.6 to 1.4, P=0.86) for externalizing behavior problems; and -0.1 (-1.3 to 1.2;"" P = 0.92) for internalizing behavior problems.

1331,"Overweight and obesity in pregnancy: the evidence-practice gap in staff knowledge, attitudes, and practices","BACKGROUND: State (Queensland) clinical guidelines reflecting current best practice are recently available for the management of pregnancy-related obesity. However, dissemination of the guidelines alone does not change practice. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the gap between evidence and practice in the multidisciplinary management of overweight and obesity in pregnancy to inform an intervention that facilitates the translation of obesity guidelines into practice in a tertiary maternity service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey, available over a three-week period (May-June 2011), was distributed to obstetrics, midwifery, and allied health personnel. Outcomes of interest included a 15-point guideline adherence score, knowledge of guideline content, advice provided, knowledge of obesity- and pregnancy-related complications, prior training, and referral patterns. RESULTS: Eighty-four staff members completed the surveys (57% response rate). A general disagreement with the guideline was observed. The majority (88.1%) referred to overweight/obesity (p/ob) as an important/very important general obstetric problem, most correctly identified the associated complications. However, only 32.1% were aware of the existing guidelines, and only half correctly identified the BMI categories for ow/ob. Compliance with referral recommendations ranged"";"" 20% of staff felt that referral was 'not their job'. CONCLUSIONS: Staff are aware of the negative outcomes associated with maternal discharge/obstetrics, although few fully comply with referral guidelines or provide advice according to recommendations. These findings will be sorted through the implementation of scientific methodological frameworks, and effective behavior change interventions will be built to facilitate the translation of this important guideline into practice.",0,0,
1332,Oxygen therapy in hospitalized patients: the impact of local guidelines,"OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of local guidelines on the behavior of medical and nursing staff to optimize the use of oxygen in hospitalized patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in a district university hospital. The guidelines produced suggested indications, monitoring, use of arterial blood gases (ABG), and advice on when to stop oxygen therapy. The guidelines were implemented both verbally and in writing to all medical and nursing staff before and after an audit studying oxygen use by patients in medical and surgical wards. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included in the pre-intervention audit and 59 in the post-intervention study. Oxygen prescription did not change with the 30% (27/90) vs. 32% (19/59). Nurses administered oxygen better 95% (18/19) vs 70% (19/27) (P = 0.043) and monitored more frequently using oximetry 91% (54/59) vs 69% (62/90) (P = 0.001) after the guidelines. Patients with airway disease had their ABG checked more frequently 87% (14/16) vs. 65% (15/23) on admission and after initiation of oxygen inhalation 68% (11/16) vs. 34% (8/23). CONCLUSION: Verbal and written guidelines did not influence oxygen prescription, but improved the practice of close follow-up of patients with airway disease.

1333,Postoperative pain management practices of pediatric nurses in non-critical care hospital settings: a narrative review,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the postoperative pain management practices of pediatric nurses with the goal of identifying factors associated with insufficiently managed pediatric postoperative pain. DESIGN: Search and systematic review. DATA SOURCES: PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and handsearching. METHODS OF REVIEW: We included peer-reviewed English-language quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research articles published between 1990 and 2012 that explored pediatric postoperative pain management practices of registered nurses. Articles with a primary focus on pain management practices of nurses in neonatal or pediatric intensive care units, recovery room, and/or focused on children with cognitive impairment were excluded. Search terms used were: ""postoperative pain""; nurses*; paediatrics; pediatrics; children; pain assessment; non-pharmacist*; analgesic*. Titles and abstracts were used for initial selection. Two investigators extracted data and assessed rigor of each RESULTS: Of the initial 248 citations, 27 studies were included Most studies were descriptive and examined relationships between personal factors and nurses' pain management practices Observational data from four articles added information provided in self-report studies Two articles used vignette experimental designs Data were categorized into four themes: pain assessment, pharmacological practices, non-pharmacological practices, and factors affecting practices Despite improvements in the administration of analgesics in the last 20 years, the practices continue to be suboptimal. of children appears to influence nurses' assessment of pain more than validated measures. A significant proportion of children had no pain scores recorded in the first 24 hours postoperatively. Children receive more analgesia when it is requested 24 hours a day compared to when it is required. However, the prescription of analgesia 24 hours a day did not guarantee administration. Nurses reported using several non-pharmacological strategies routinely, but some are not evidence-based. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicate that nurses' assessment and management of pain in children is not consistent with published guidelines. Results from studies exploring nurse-child related factors are inconclusive. Research should examine the impact of organizational factors on nurses' pain care practices. Intervention studies are needed to determine the most effective strategies to support and improve nurses' care of children's pain.",0,1,
1334,Pain descriptors for critically ill patients unable to self-report,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the descriptors used by nurses in two Canadian intensive care units to document the presence of pain in critically ill patients who are unable to self-report. BACKGROUND: Systematic documentation of pain assessment is essential for communication and continuity of pain management, allowing for better pain control, maximizing recovery, and reducing physical and psychological sequelae. METHOD: Retrospective, mixed method, with observational design in two level III intensive care units of a quaternary academic center in Toronto, Canada. During 2008-2009, data were abstracted through chart review guided by a reference compendium of potential behavioral descriptors compiled from existing behavioral pain assessment tools. RESULTS: A total of 679 narrative descriptions were extracted. Behavioral (232, 34%), physiological (93, 14%), and descriptors indicating that the patient was pain-free (117, 17%) were used to describe the presence or absence of pain. Narratives also described analgesia administered without pain assessment descriptors (117, 17%) and assessment and administration of analgesics before a known painful procedure (30, 4%). Emerging themes included life-threatening treatment interference, decision-making uncertainty, and a continuum of wakefulness. CONCLUSION: Inconsistent or ambiguous documentation was problematic in this sample. This may reflect confusing behaviors and concomitant security priorities. Developing a lexicon of pain assessment descriptors for critically ill patients who cannot self-report for use in combination with valid and reliable measures may improve documentation that facilitates appropriate analgesic management. Unit protocols or guidelines that prioritize an analgesia test before the administration of sedatives can reduce uncertainty in decision making when patients exhibit ambiguous behaviors such as agitation or restlessness.",0,0,

1336,Parallel Pathways to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes: The Evidence Matters,"Gaps and disparities in the delivery of HF education by nurses and performance in achieving self-care behaviors by patients with advanced HF may be factors in clinical decompensation and unplanned health care consumption . Is nurse-led education delivered effectively before hospital discharge? Nursing leaders need to understand the strength of the nurses' knowledge base around self-care principles and significant barriers to best practice. Nurses may not feel comfortable teaching patients about dry weight, meal planning, heart failure medications, or progressive activity and exercise steps. Additionally, clinical nurses may not have the time to provide detailed patient education prior to discharge. Equally important, research is needed to understand the factors that improve patients' adherence to heart failure self-management behaviors, because adherence to evidence-based national heart failure guideline recommendations improves clinical outcomes. Thus, nurses and patients are on parallel paths related to laying the groundwork for better adherence to self-management in advanced heart failure. Through research, we found that nurses were not adequately prepared as heart failure educators and that patients did not believe they could control heart failure. In 2 educational intervention studies that aimed to help patients understand that they could control fluid management and follow a strict daily fluid limit, patients had better clinical outcomes. Therefore, misperceptions about heart failure can be overcome with interventions that go beyond communicating ""what"" self-care behaviors are recommended. The research results reflect that evidence matters! Systems and processes are needed to support nurses' awareness, comfort, and frequency of providing predischarge self-management education, to increase the accuracy of patients' beliefs about managing heart failure, and to improve patient care. patients' willingness to adhere to guideline-recommended heart failure guidelines. - Care behaviors.

1337,Parental presence during invasive procedures and resuscitation: evaluation of a change in clinical practice,"BACKGROUND: The presence of parents during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation is a relatively underdeveloped and controversial practice. Much of the concern stems from apprehension in the medical community. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the implementation of formal practice guidelines and corresponding interprofessional education would improve physicians' sense of preparedness and comfort in providing parents with options during their child's procedures. METHODS: Multiphase pre-post survey of (1) physician perceptions and (2) practice from the perspective of physicians and parents undergoing the same procedure. Data were collected over 4 years from a cardiovascular and critical care program at a US children's hospital. and 274 parents participated in the practice surveys. After the intervention, clinicians reported that parents were present during the more invasive procedures and reported higher levels of comfort with the practice of providing parents with options during resuscitation events. Comfort levels were higher in clinicians who had practiced skills in a simulated learning environment. During both phases, few clinicians reported that the presence of parents affected their technical performance (4%), therapeutic decision-making (5%), or ability to teach (9%). During the later phase, physicians reported more active parental behaviors during the procedures. Parents who reported receiving information to help them prepare for their child's procedures reported higher levels of procedural understanding and emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of practice guidelines and interprofessional education had a positive impact on physicians' perceptions and practices by providing parents with options and support during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation of their children.",0,0,

PARTICIPANTS 153 parents from socially disadvantaged areas, with children aged 36 to 59 months at risk for conduct disorder defined by scores above the clinical cutoff on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio, 104 to the intervention and 49 to remain on the waiting list (control). Twenty (13%) were lost to follow up six months later, 18 from the intervention group. INTERVENTION The Webster-Stratton Incredible Years core parenting program, a 12-week group intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Children's problem behavior and parenting skills assessed by parent self-reports and by direct observation at home. Parental competence, parental self-reported stress and depression. Standardized and well-validated instruments were used at all times. RESULTS At follow-up, most measures of parenting and child behavior problems showed significant improvement in the intervention group.

SETTING Sure Start areas in North and Mid Wales. PARTICIPANTS Parents of 116 children aged 36 to 59 months (87% of the clinical sample) at risk of developing behavioral disorders defined by score above the clinical cutoff on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory). The children were identified by health visitors and recruited by the research team. INTERVENTION Webster-Stratton Incredible Years Basic Parenting Program or a six-month waiting list check. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incremental cost per unit of improvement in intensity score of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory. RESULTS The point estimate of incremental cost-effectiveness with snatch was £73 (€109, $142) per one point improvement in intensity score (95% confidence interval £42 to £140) . It would cost 5,486 (€8,190, $10,666) to bring the child with the highest intensity score below the clinical cut-off point and 1,344 (€2,006, $2,618) to bring the average child in the intervention group to the non-clinical limits on the score. intensity (below 127). For a maximum ratio of £100 (€149, $194) per point increase in intensity score, there is an 83.9% chance that the intervention will be cost-effective. The average cost per child attending the parent group was £1,934 (€2,887, $3,760) for eight children and £1,289 (€1,924, $2,506) for 12 children, including start-up costs and training materials. the group leaders. When we categorized the sample into relatively mild, moderate, and severe behavioral groups based on intensity scores at baseline, the intervention seemed most cost-effective in those at highest risk of developing conduct disorder. CONCLUSION This parenting program improves infant behavior as measured by the Eyberg Infant Behavior Inventory Intensity Score at relatively low cost and was cost-effective compared to the waiting list control. This rearing program involves modest costs and demonstrates a strong clinical effect, suggesting that it would represent good value for money for public spending.",0,0,

1341,Participant- and study-related characteristics predicting treatment completion and study retention in an adolescent smoking cessation trial.,"Purpose: To determine what factors predict completion and retention of smoking cessation treatment among adolescents. Methods: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy of motivational interviewing with brief structured advice to quit smoking and reduce tobacco use in adolescents (n = 355) aged 14 to 18 years (55% female, 45% Black, 12% Hispanic). Treatment spanned 12 weeks, with follow-up evaluations at 24 weeks. Completion of treatment was defined as the completion of all five counseling sessions. Study retention was defined as completing the 24-week evaluation. Participant and study variables served as predictors of treatment completion and retention. Results: Overall, 79% of participants completed all five counseling sessions and the same percentage completed the 24-week evaluation. Black race, stage prior to reduction contemplation, and shorter time period between initial assessment and first counseling session were significantly associated with treatment completion. For every 7.5 days of delay in starting treatment after the initial visit, there was a 50% decrease in the odds of completing all five treatment sessions. Retention at 24 weeks was predicted by black race, younger age, higher maternal education, expectations of graduating from college, and structured brief counseling intervention. Conclusions: High rates of treatment completion and study retention can be achieved in a multi-session behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in adolescents. The findings suggest that treatment should start soon after the intake session to maximize treatment completion. Improved efforts to retain older adolescents and youth with lower academic goals and lower family income will be important in future studies.

1344,Participatory Action Research in Antimicrobial Stewardship: A Novel Approach to Improve Antimicrobial Prescription in Hospitals and Long-Term Care Facilities,"It is a challenge to change the antimicrobial prescribing behavior of physicians. Although antimicrobial prescribing is determined by contextual (eg, lack of guidelines), cultural (eg, peer practice), and behavioral (eg, perceived autonomy in decision making), most antimicrobial stewardship programs do not take these factors into account in their approach. This may lead to suboptimal efficacy of the intervention. We present a new approach in antimicrobial stewardship program development that addresses the relevant determinants of antimicrobial prescription: participatory action research (PAR). PAR is a collaborative process that aims to bring about change in social situations by producing practical knowledge that is useful in local practice. It requires substantial engagement of relevant stakeholders to address the determinants of the studied behavior and facilitate empowerment. PAR is suitable for complex problems in multidisciplinary settings as it is tailored to local needs, providing a tailored approach to improve local practice. We describe how PAR can be applied to antimicrobial stewardship and describe the PAR design of two ongoing multicenter antimicrobial stewardship projects, in the acute care setting and the long-term care setting, respectively.",0,0,

METHODS: Family physicians from two practices were asked to discuss the importance of early breast cancer detection with all eligible patients who visited the clinic for any reason and to help them schedule a screening appointment. The files of the patients who received the recommendation were sealed accordingly. At the end of the program, the doctors' records were audited and the potential candidates for breast cancer screening were divided into two groups: those who had received the intervention (n = 251) and those who had not (n = 187). ; "" The results were also compared with those of a third group of patients who had attended an examination on their own initiative (n = 100) before the study (i.e., did not require intervention). A random sample of half of the patients also completed an ad hoc questionnaire covering sociodemographic variables and the impact of the physicians' intervention on their behavior.RESULTS:Patients in the intervention group showed a significantly greater change in behavior regarding breast cancer screening than controls (32% versus 13%, P = 0.001).This change was particularly apparent in the group of women aged 50 to 74 years who were recommended to undergo mammography (according to the guidelines).CONCLUSION: Although this is a study In just two practices, the results suggest that primary care physicians can significantly alter their patients' behavior regarding screening. regular loves. The use of a special reminder can also help the individual clinician to ensure that each patient has received the proper instructions.",0,0,
1348,Patient Advocacy and Advance Care Planning in the Acute Hospital Setting,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explain the role of patient advocacy in the advance care planning (ACP-ing) process. Nurses rate the prolongation of the dying process with inappropriate measures as their most troubling ethical issue and the protection of patients' rights as a major concern (Johnston et al 2002). Paradoxically, ethical codes assume that nurses have the autonomy to advocate for patients' health care choices. Advance directives (ADs) designed to improve end-of-life care are poorly accepted, and acute care hospitals are often unprepared for the few that receive them. The Respect for Patient Choices Program (RPCP) enhances AD utilization by providing a supportive framework for ACP-ing and primarily equipping nurses as RPC consultants. Helping patients in this process requires attributes consistent with patient advocacy stemming from the most basic principle of nursing, caring for others. DESIGN: Likert scale survey administered before and six months after the intervention to pilot and control groups, with matching focus groups. SETTING: Selected wards in a public acute care hospital in South Australia. SUBJECTS: Nurses from the pilot palliative, respiratory, renal and colorectal care wards and from the haemo-oncology, coronary care, cardiology and neurology/geriatric control wards. INTERVENTION: The RPCP during the 2004-2005 South Australian pilot of the (RPCP). MAIN RESULTS: The organizational support of ACP-ing gave nurses the autonomy to be patient advocates regarding end-of-life care, reconciling clinical practice with its code of ethics and alleviating distress over prolonging life. inappropriate death process. RESULTS: Statistically significant survey results in the post-intervention group showed that nurses experienced: encouragement to ensure patients were able to make informed decisions about their end-of-life treatment (84%); the ability to fulfill these wishes in practice (73%) ; and job satisfaction in providing adequate end-of-life care (67%);"" compared to about half (42-55%) of respondents in the pre-intervention and control groups. Focus group participants shared that they used to be difficult to advocate for patients, but now they could act legitimately and felt ethically comfortable regarding end-of-life care.CONCLUSION: Findings suggested that patient advocacy, fostered by the supportive CPR environment, effects the ACP-ing process It is recommended that the RPCP be recognized and developed as an integral part of promoting end-of-life quality assurance and associated job satisfaction.",0,0,
1349,Patient and physician reminders to promote colorectal cancer screening: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Screening reduces colorectal cancer mortality, but effective screening tests remain underused. Systematic reminders for patients and doctors could increase detection rates. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patient and physician reminders at 11 ambulatory health care centers. Participants included 21,860 patients aged 50 to 80 years who had missed colorectal cancer screening and 110 primary care physicians. Patients were randomly assigned to receive mailings containing an educational brochure, a fecal occult blood test kit, and instructions for direct scheduling of a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive electronic reminders during office visits for patients due for screening. The primary outcome was receiving fecal occult blood tests, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy for 15 months, and the secondary outcome was detection of colorectal adenomas. Results Detection rates were higher for patients who received mailings compared to those who did not (44.0% vs. 38.1%""; P < 0.001). The effect increased with age: +3.7% for ages 50 to 59 years, +7.3% for ages 60 to 69 years, and +10.1% for ages 70 to 80 years (P = 0.01 for trend). between patients of physicians who received electronic reminders and the control group (41.9% vs. 40.2%; P = .001).47 However, electronic reminders tended to increase detection rates among patients with 3 or more primary care visits (59.5% vs. 52.7%; P = .07) Adenoma detection tended to increase with mailings to patients (5.7% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.10) and medical reminders (6.0% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.09).Conclusions Reminders sent by mail to patients are an effective tool to promote detection cancer r colorectal, and electronic reminders to physicians may increase screening among adults who have more frequent primary care visits.",1,1,
1350,Patient education about cough: effect on consultation behavior of general medicine patients,"The aim of this general practice study was to examine how the consultation behavior of cough patients was affected when the tasks and responsibilities of patients, nurses, and general practitioners were reorganized. In four 'average' one-person general practices, the effects on patient consultation behavior of a rational cough practice policy and the provision of systematic cough patient education were compared with patient behavior in four general practices. paired controls. Behavioral changes were measured in 548 patients who consulted for cough at least twice, in two successive autumn-winter periods. Significantly more patients in the experimental practice changed their behavior to follow the practice guidelines than patients in the control practices (56% versus 30%, P less than 0.001). The proportion of patients who continued to consult in the approved manner was higher among patients who received the intervention (66% versus 29%, P less than 0.001). This was equally true for patients who had experienced fewer than four cough episodes or more than four episodes. The more often the patients received the education, the more effective it was. All patients who consulted their GP for cough during the first autumn-winter period completed a cough diary during the second period. From this, it appeared that the intervention did not cause patients to delay consultation when they had a cough lasting more than three weeks or one with 'severe' symptoms. It would seem that a rational practice policy and the provision of patient education can encourage patients to modify their consulting behaviour. This could result in a reduction in health care costs.",0,0,
1351,Patient education for colon cancer screening: a randomized trial of a video mailed before a physical examination,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening is underutilized and primary care physicians are challenged to provide patient education within the constraints of busy practices. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of an educational video, mailed to patients' homes before a physical examination, on the performance of colorectal cancer screening, particularly sigmoidoscopy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 5 primary care practices in central Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: 938 patients aged 50 to 74 years who were scheduled for an upcoming physical examination, had no personal history of colorectal cancer, and were eligible for lower endoscopy screening according to current guidelines. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n = 488) or a video about colorectal cancer, the importance of early detection, and screening options (n = 450). MEASUREMENTS: Baseline and 6-month follow-up telephone assessments were performed. A dependent variable classified screening from baseline as 1) sigmoidoscopy with or without other tests, 2) another test or combination of tests, or 3) no test. RESULTS: Overall detection rates were the same in the intervention and control groups (55%). In the regression model, intervention participants were nonsignificantly more likely to complete sigmoidoscopy alone or in combination with another test (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.70]) . Intervention dose (watch at least half of the video) was significantly associated with receiving a sigmoidoscopy with or without another test (odds ratio, 2.81 [CI, 1.85 to 4.26]). Recruitment records showed that at least 23% of people presenting for regular health assessments were currently undergoing a lower endoscopy procedure and were therefore ineligible. LIMITATIONS: The primary care sample studied consisted primarily of white, middle-class people who had high screening rates at baseline. The results may not be generalizable to other populations. The trial was conducted during a period of increased health insurance coverage for lower endoscopy procedures and public media attention to colon cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: A mailed video had no effect on the overall colorectal cancer screening rate and only modestly improved sigmoidoscopy screening rates among patients in primary care practices.",0,0,
1352,Patient engagement programs for the recognition and initial treatment of depression in primary care,"Importance Encouraging primary care patients to address depression symptoms and care with clinicians might improve outcomes, but may also result in unnecessary treatment. Objective To determine whether a depression engagement video (DEV) or personalized interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) improves initial depression care compared with a control without increasing unnecessary prescribing of antidepressants. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial comparing SVD, PPMI, and control among 925 adult patients treated by 135 primary care physicians (603 patients with depression and 322 patients without depression, defined by the C9 [PHQ-9] score of the Patient Health) conducted from June 2010 through March 2012 at 7 primary care clinical sites in California. DEV interventions targeting gender and income, an IMCP tailored to individual patient characteristics, and a sleep hygiene video (control). Main outcomes and measures Among depressed patients, superiority assessment of the composite measure of patient-reported antidepressant drug recommendation, mental health referral, or both (primary outcome)""; depression at 12-week follow-up, as measured by the PHQ -8 (secondary outcome).Among nondepressed patients, noninferiority assessment of physician- and patient-reported antidepressant drug recommendation (primary outcomes) with a noninferiority margin of 3.5%. adjusted for groups.Results Of the 925 eligible patients, 867 were included in the analysis (depressed, 559; nondepressed, 308).Among depressed patients, the rates of achieving the primary outcome were 17.5% for SVD, 26% for PPMI and 16.3% for control (DEV vs. control, 1.1 [95% CI, ?6.7 to 8.9], P = .79; PPMI vs. control, 9.9 [95% CI, 1.6 to 18.2], p = 0.02).There was no effect on score PHQ-8 measurement of depression at 12-week follow-up: DEV vs. control, 0.2 (95% CI, 1.2 to 0.8), PPMI vs. control, 0.9 (95% CI, ?0.1 to 1.9). Among nondepressed patients, physician-reported antidepressant prescription in the DEV and PPMI groups was noninferior to control (mean percentage point difference [PPD]: DEV vs control, 2.2 [90% CI, 8, 0 to 3.49], P = ? 0.0499 for noninferiority, PPMI vs control, 3.3 [90% CI, 9.1 to 2.4], P = 0.02 for noninferiority); patient-reported antidepressant recommendation did not achieve noninferiority (mean PPD: SED vs. control, ≥ 0.9 [90% CI, ≥ 4.9 to 6.7], P = ≥ 0.23 for noninferiority ;"" PPMI vs control, ≥ 0.3 [90% CI], ?5.1 to 5.7], P?=?.16 for non-inferiority). Conclusions and relevance A personalized PPMI increased physicians' recommendations for antidepressant medications , a mental health referral, or both among depressed patients, but had no effect on mental health at 12 The possibility that IMCP and DEV increased patient-reported medical recommendations for a drug could not be excluded antidepressant among nondepressed patients.",0,0,
1353,Patients' perceptions of risky drinking: knowledge of low-risk daily and weekly guidelines and standard drink sizes,"BACKGROUND: Effective intervention for hazardous drinking requires clinicians and patients to be aware of low-risk daily and weekly guidelines and what constitutes a 'standard drink'. The authors hypothesized that most patients lack this knowledge and that education is required. METHODS: After primary care visits, patients completed anonymous exit questionnaires that included the 3 questions of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Consumption Test (AUDIT-C): ""How many drinks (containing alcohol) can you take safely in one day?"" and questions about the size, in ounces, of a standard drink of wine, beer, and liquor. Descriptive analyzes were performed in Stata. RESULTS: Of 1,331 respondents (60% women, mean age: 49.6, SD = 17.5), 21% tested positive on the AUDIT-C for hazardous use. Just 10% of those accurately estimated low-risk daily limits, with exactly 9% at the weekly limits, and half of the estimated low-risk limits at or below the guidelines. Fewer than half who marked ""Yes"" to ""Do you know what a 'standard drink' is?"" provided accurate answers for beer, wine, or liquor. Patients with a positive test were twice as likely to say they knew what a standard drink is, but only a third gave precise estimates. When asked about plans for the next month regarding changing drinking behavior, 23% with a positive AUDIT-C indicated that they were at least considering a change. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in primary care are unaware of the specific National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for low-risk alcohol use. Exploring patients' perceptions of low-risk patterns and current drinking behavior may reveal discrepancies worth discussing. For at-risk drinkers, most of whom are unaware of low-risk daily and weekly guidelines or standard drink sizes, education can be vital to intervene. The findings suggest the need for detailed and explicit social marketing and communication about exactly what low-risk drinking entails.",0,0,
1354,Patient Safety Research: An Overview of the Global Evidence,"Background Unsafe medical care can cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite imprecise estimates of the magnitude of the problem. To better understand the scope and nature of the problem of unsafe care, the WHO World Alliance for Patient Safety commissioned a review of the world literature on patient safety research. Methods Major patient safety issues were identified through a consultative and investigative process and classified under the framework of structure, process, and outcomes of unsafe care. Leading experts reviewed the current evidence and identified important knowledge gaps related to issues in developing, transition and developed countries. The report was reviewed by internal and external experts and made improvements based on feedback. Findings Twenty-three major patient safety issues were examined. Much of the evidence for unsafe care outcomes comes from developed countries, where prevalence studies show that between 3% and 16% of hospitalized patients are harmed by medical care. Data from transition and developing countries also suggest substantial harm from health care. However, considerable gaps in knowledge about the structural and process factors underlying unsafe care globally make it difficult to identify solutions, especially in resource-poor settings. Interpretation The harm caused by medical care appears to represent a substantial burden on the world's population. However, much of the evidence base comes from developed countries. Understanding the scope of, and solutions to, unsafe care for the rest of the world is a critical component of providing safe and effective care to all of the world's citizens.",0,1,
1355,Patient Safety: The Physician's Perspective,"Medical errors can be defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as planned or the use of an incorrect plan to achieve a goal. Beyond their economic cost and their cost in human lives, errors cause loss of trust in the health system by patients and a decrease in the satisfaction of both patients and health professionals. There are many evidence-based safety-oriented behaviors and interventions that are easily implemented, such as ultrasound-guided central venous catheter insertion, prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, and more. In vascular access, the development of patient safety research has raised a variety of issues that require study to provide the optimal approach to patient safety. Patients are the primary contributors to their own safety, and as such, clinicians must develop a new approach to involving them in the decision-making cycle at every step of their treatment. There are many opportunities along this path for the patient to engage in safety behaviors and for the access team to ensure such behaviors using simple strategies. The advent of the access center, based on multidisciplinary teamwork, has increased the potential to improve patient safety by preventing errors in planning and performing access surgery, avoiding delays in treating access malfunctions. access and improving communication between team members. However, a significant research effort is still needed to implement an intervention based on evidence-based data and focused on patient safety.",0,0,
1356,Card prompts carried by the patient versus computer generated prompts to remind private practice physicians to perform health maintenance measures.,"Background: We compared the efficacy of a computer-generated instruction sheet placed at the front of patient charts with a patient-carried instruction card in reminding clinicians to perform selected elements of health maintenance. Methods: A single-blind prospective randomized study was conducted in private practice offices in rural eastern North Carolina, involving 28 family physicians and nine general internists. Twenty-two physicians were randomly assigned to the computer prompt group and 22 to the card prompt group. Four physicians in the computer group did not complete the study due to problems with the computer software, and three physicians did not complete the study because their limited staff were unable to enter patient data into the computer. Before the intervention, the medical records of 20 patients (10 men and 10 women) of each doctor were audited to determine the performance of influenza vaccinations, fecal occult blood, Pap tests, breast exams performed by the doctors and mammograms One year after the intervention was instituted, record audits were again performed for the above five items on 20 different patient records for each physician. Results: There was a 7% increase in influenza vaccine yield in the card group (17% vs. 24%) compared to a 6% increase in the computer group (20% vs. 26%). ). There was a 5% decrease in stool yield for occult blood in the card group (28% vs. 23%) compared to a 1% increase in the computer group (30% vs. 31%). There was an 11% decrease in Pap smear performance in the card group (26% vs. 15%) compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (23% vs. 26%) . There was a 2% decrease in physician performance of breast exams in the card group (35% vs. 33%) compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (30% vs. 33% ). Finally, there was a 3% increase in mammography throughput in the card group (22% vs. 25%) compared to an 11% increase in the computer group (15% vs. 26%). Conclusions: Our data show a greater increase in the performance of health maintenance items in the computer-assisted group. Yield of stool for occult blood, Pap smears, physician-performed breast exams, and mammograms increased more in the computer-guided group than in the card group. However, there was no statistically significant difference after intervention for any of the health maintenance items audited for either the computer group or the card group. In general, health maintenance measures were performed only in a minority of suitable patients. (Arch Intern Med. 1994"";""154:1957-1960)",0,1,
1357,Patients with gout adhere to curative treatment if adequately informed: a proof-of-concept observational study,"INTRODUCTION: Many physicians believe that gout patients are unwilling to receive urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and blame them for poor treatment adherence. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a complex gout intervention that incorporates key elements of current guidelines, including comprehensive patient information, delivered in an optimal setting (specialized hospital clinic). METHOD: Observational study of patients reporting ongoing gout attacks recruited from primary care lists. A total of 106 participants (94 men, 12 women""; mean age 61 years) were enrolled in the study. Patients received a predominantly nurse-led intervention that included education, individualized lifestyle counseling, and appropriate ULT. The predefined goal was to achieve serum uric acid (SUA)</=360 mumol/L after 1 year in at least 70% of participants.RESULTS: Of 106 participants at baseline, 16% had tophi;mean (SD) baseline SUA was 456 (98) micromol/L All participants agreed to co-aspiration to confirm gout and all wanted to receive ULT At 12 months, 92% of 106 participants had achieved therapeutic goal (SUA</=360 micromole);"" 85% had SUA <300 micromol/l. Allopurinol was the most widely used ULT, requiring a mean dose of 400 mg daily to reach target. Improvements in Short Form-36 (significant for pain) were seen after 1 year. CONCLUSION: A predominantly nurse-led intervention that includes education, lifestyle advice, and ULT can successfully achieve the recommended treatment goal in more than 9 out of 10 patients. The full explanation and discussion of the nature of gout and its treatment options and the individualization of management probably explain this success.",0,0,
1358,"Pearls, dangers and pitfalls in the evaluation and treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adolescents","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide clinicians with an up-to-date overview of key considerations related to the clinical evaluation and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: The recently revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 of the American Psychiatric Association included significant changes regarding the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recently revised its Clinical Practice Guidelines for ADHD"";"" while the previous guidelines focused on children ages 6 to 12, the new guidelines extend to ages 17. Understanding these revised diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines is essential for pediatricians and others who care for adolescents. In addition to providing an updated review of the clinical approach to the assessment and treatment of ADHD in adolescents, recent findings related to common comorbidities, psychosocial risks, and long-term outcomes are briefly described. ABSTRACT: The diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD presents unique challenges and obstacles. Clinicians should be careful and deliberate in their evaluation of an adolescent with new-onset symptoms suggestive of ADHD, taking into account other conditions that might mimic ADHD and screening for common comorbid conditions. When it comes to treating adolescents, the AAP recommends medication as a first-line intervention, noting that stimulants have a much broader evidence base and effect size than non-stimulants. Although clinicians now have a multitude of drug formulations to choose from, they must also be vigilant about the potential for misuse and diversion of stimulants.",0,0,

Many communities have a shortage of mental health providers, and most children with anxiety do not receive the evidence-based treatment they need. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and effects of a brief, seven-session cognitive-behavioral skill-building intervention, Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE), that was administered to anxious children by a pediatric nurse in a primary care center. around. METHODS: A pre-experimental, single-group, pre-test and post-test design was used. RESULTS: Children who participated had a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms (13.88 points, SD = 17.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.13-28.89), as well as a increased knowledge of cognitive-behavioral coping skills (M = 11.38, CI = 5.99-8.26, p = .00) and better functioning (at school and at home).

PARTICIPANTS 395 patients (192 in the intervention group, 203 in the control group) and 29 support partners with type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION All practices introduced a standardized system of diabetes care. The peer support intervention was developed over a two-year period and contained four elements: the recruitment and training of support peers, nine support peer-led group meetings in the participant's own general practice, and a retention plan. for fellow supporters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES HbA(1c)""; cholesterol concentration; systolic blood pressure;"" and well-being score. RESULTS There was no difference between intervention and control patients at baseline. All practices and 85% (337) of patients were followed up. At two years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in HbA(1c) (mean difference -0.08%, 95% confidence interval -0.35% to 0.18%), systolic blood pressure (-3 .9 mm Hg, -8.9 to 1.1 mm Hg), total cholesterol concentration (-0.03 mmol/L, -0.28 to 0.22 mmol/L), or wellness scores (-0, 7, -2.3 to 0.8). While there was a trend toward a decrease in the proportion of patients with poorly controlled risk factors during follow-up, particularly for systolic blood pressure (52% (87/166) >130 mm Hg at intervention vs. 61% (103 /169) > 130 mm Hg in the control), these changes were not significant. Process evaluation indicated that, overall, the intervention was delivered as planned, although 18% (35) of patients in the intervention group never attended any group meetings. CONCLUSIONS A peer-based group support intervention is feasible in general practice settings, but the intervention was not effective when targeted to all patients with type 2 diabetes. they do not support the widespread adoption of peer support.

DESIGN: This was a descriptive study using baseline data from an intervention study in course, Testing the Impact of Care Focused on Function Intervention, Res-Care-AL. SETTING: Four assisted living communities in Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 171 residents and 96 ANs gave their consent, approved eligibility, and were included in this study. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive data from NA and residents were obtained. Resident data also included self-efficacy and outcome expectations associated with functional tasks and exercise, social support for exercise, and subjective and objective information about functions. and physical activity. NA data included self-efficacy and outcome expectations, knowledge, and function-focused care performance. RESULTS: The residents were mostly female, white, and widowed; needed some help with activities of daily living; and participated in very little physical activity based on subjective and objective reports. NAs were predominantly female and black, had more than a decade of nursing experience, high confidence but limited knowledge of function-focused care, and performed this care in 76% of observed care interactions. There were no site-specific differences between NAs regarding role-focused care beliefs, knowledge, or performance. There were site-specific differences in residents regarding self-efficacy for functional capacity; functional presentation; social supports for expert exercise""; and family, person-environment adjustment, and physical activity based on subjective surveys. No differences were observed based on actigraphy. CONCLUSION: Residents of AL communities participate in very limited amounts of physical activity and staff at these sites could benefit from continued education on how to increase physical activity among residents and help them meet current guidelines for physical activity to optimize overall health.",0,0,
1362,Performance of the TREAT decision support system in an environment with a low prevalence of resistant pathogens.,"Objectives To evaluate a decision support system (TREAT) for the guidance of empiric antimicrobial therapy in a setting with a low prevalence of resistant pathogens. Methods A retrospective TREAT trial was conducted at the University of Copenhagen, Hvidovre Hospital. The patient cohort included adults with systemic inflammation and suspected community-acquired bacterial infection. TREAT-recommended empiric antimicrobial therapy was compared with empiric antimicrobial therapy prescribed by the first treating clinician. Results Of 171 patients recruited, 161 (65 with microbiologically documented infections) met the TREAT inclusion criteria. The coverage achieved by TREAT was significantly greater than that of clinical practice (86% versus 66%, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the cost of future resistance between TREAT-selected and physician-selected treatments. Direct costs for antimicrobials were higher in TREAT when patients without antimicrobial treatment were included, while there were no significant differences in other cases. The cost of side effects was significantly lower with TREAT. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that TREAT may improve the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy and reduce the cost of side effects in regions with a low prevalence of resistant pathogens, however, at the expense of increased use of antibiotics.",0,1,
1363,Perioperative Care Map Improves Compliance with Best Practices for the Morbidly Obese,"BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity can complicate perioperative management. Best practice guidelines have been published but are generally followed only in bariatric patients. Little is known about clinicians' awareness of and adherence to these clinical recommendations for non-bariatric operations. Our study evaluated whether an educational intervention could improve medical screening and adherence to established best practices for all surgically treated morbidly obese patients. METHODS: In 2013, a care map outlining best practices for morbidly obese patients was distributed to all surgeons and anesthesiologists at 4 university hospitals. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were sent to participants in 2012 and 2015 to assess changes in clinical practice. A post-intervention record audit determined physician compliance with distributed guidelines. RESULTS: In the study, 567 physicians completed the survey in 2012 and 375 physicians completed the survey in 2015. Post-intervention, statistically significant improvements were seen in the percentage of surgeons and anesthesiologists combined who reported changing their management of morbidly obese patients surgically treated to meet best practice preoperatively (89% vs. 59%), intraoperatively (71% vs. 54%), postoperatively (80% vs. 57%), and overall (88% vs. to 72%). Results were similar when surgeons and anesthesiologists were analyzed separately. An audit of 170 case files from the 4 hospitals found that 167 (98%) cases met best practice. CONCLUSION: After the distribution of the map of care, the percentage of doctors who reported having changed their management to adapt to best practices improved significantly. These findings highlight the beneficial impact that this educational intervention can have on medical behavior. Continued research is needed to assess the influence of this intervention on clinical outcomes.",0,0,

1365,Person-Centered Primary Care Strategies for the Assessment and Intervention of Aggressive Behaviors in Dementia,"With an increase in the number of people affected by dementia, it is imperative that health care providers are well versed in the most effective ways to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as aggression. Aggression can be particularly difficult to manage because it creates a risk of harm for formal and informal caregivers, and medical intervention options are complex and situation-dependent. Although multiple guidelines for the management of aggression in dementia are available in the literature, their scope is broad and suggested treatments often vary, making decision-making difficult for busy clinicians. Using a composite case as a model, the current article provides guidelines that guide outpatient providers through the steps necessary to provide effective treatment for aggression in people with dementia. Shifting the current focal point of care for patients with aggressive dementia to a more person-centered approach will have a positive impact on patient care.

The PC interventions consisted of: adapting the dose (42.2%) and adding treatments (31.9%). The main drugs involved referred to the cardiovascular (33.1%), digestive-metabolic (28.6%) and hematopoietic (21.6%) systems. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of a PC in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is necessary for the identification and prevention of PRM. In addition to the medical improvement of CKD patients, the CP participates in the development of prescription recommendations and therapeutic education programs for patients. In addition, redefining the roles and practices of members of a clinical team has been shown to be effective in optimizing care for CKD patients. In addition, the patient's admission to dialysis is postponed, which translates into a reduction in health care insurance costs.",0,0,
1367,Pharmacoeconomic consequences of measuring and modifying hospital drug use,"Patterns of drug use affect the provision of medical care in hospitals in various ways. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) precipitate around 5% of admissions and impair the care of around 20% of hospitalized patients, while inadequate pharmacological treatment impairs outcomes and prolongs hospital stay. On the contrary, the appropriate application of medications can promote recovery and increase the quality of care. Well-documented examples include the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and postoperative wound infections. Consequently, optimizing drug use represents an important quality assurance issue in addition to determining the cost-effectiveness of health care delivery. Drug utilization review (DUR) requires all elements of the quality assurance process. In practice, therapeutically meaningful and cost-effective exercises can only be mounted if the link between patterns of drug use and clinical outcomes is known. These measurement processes currently limit the speed of quality assurance. There are several ways to measure drug use in hospitals. These range from readily available and relatively inexpensive quantitative methods to methods that require the availability of expert personnel. There is a sequence of methods involving increasing costs and increasing demands on resources that produce ever greater detail of the information obtained. This sequence begins with pharmacy purchases, followed by pharmacy shipments to particular clinical areas, prescription or treatment sheet survey, chart review, and finally reports from trained investigators working in the clinical area. The simplest methods can provide useful information and an efficient basis for choosing and planning definitive studies. Once a category of drug use is appropriately selected for intervention, drug use can be changed through planned intervention with improved clinical outcomes and reduced economic costs in many cases. Intervention strategies to modify drug use can be classified into re-educational, persuasive, facilitative and power strategies. Other models for implementing behavior change have been considered, including the impact of trained researchers and the use of online electronic prescriptions with interactive software with appropriate guidelines. The challenge is to achieve sustained change when interventions are implemented. Quality assurance of cost-effective medicine use is possible with modest resources if results-oriented activities are prioritized.",0,0,
1368,Pharmacological treatment of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline,"Background: Pharmacological interventions are often prescribed for insomnia disorder. Purpose: To assess the benefits, harms, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for adults with insomnia disorder. Data sources: Various electronic databases (2004Â¨C September 2015), reference lists, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents. Study selection: 35 randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks duration that evaluated pharmacotherapies available in the United States and reported global or sleep outcomes; 11 long-term observational studies reporting harm information; FDA review data for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists and product labels for all agents. Data extraction: data extraction by a single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer; risk of bias assessment by two investigators; consensus determination of the strength of the evidence. Data synthesis: eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant better short-term sleep and global outcomes compared with placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low- to moderate-strength evidence) The evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, agonists of melatonin and antidepressants, and for most pharmacological interventions in older adults, was insufficient or underpowered. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or between pharmacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. The evidence of harm reported in the trials was judged to be insufficient or of low strength; observational studies suggested that the use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with an increased risk of dementia, fractures, and serious injuries. FDA documents reported that most drug therapies had risks of cognitive and behavioral changes. , including difficulty driving and other side effects, recommending dose reduction in women and older adults. Limitations: Most trials were small and short-term and included people who met strict criteria. Often minimal important differences in outcomes were not stated or reported. Data were sparse for many treatments. Conclusion: Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term sleep and global outcomes in adults with insomnia disorder, but the comparative effectiveness and long-term efficacy of the treatments are unknown. Pharmacotherapies for insomnia. it can cause cognitive and behavioral changes and may be associated with rare but serious harm. Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

1369,Pharmacological treatment of low bone density or osteoporosis to prevent fractures: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians,"Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the available evidence on various drug treatments to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. Methods: Published literature on this topic was identified using MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006), ACP Journal Club database, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (no date limit), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (no date limits), UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Websites (no date limits), and the UK Health Technology Assessment Program (January 1998 to December 2006). Searches were limited to publications in English and human studies. Keywords for the search included terms for osteoporosis, osteopenia, low bone density, and medications listed in the key questions. This guideline rates the evidence and recommendations according to the ACP clinical practice guideline rating system. Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians offer drug treatment to men and women who have known osteoporosis and those who have experienced fragility fractures (Grade: ""Strong recommendation""; high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians consider drug therapy. pharmacological treatment for men and women who are at risk of developing osteoporosis (Grade: Weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clinicians choose between pharmacological treatment options for osteoporosis in men and women based on an assessment of risks and benefits in individual patients (Grade: Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence.)

1371,Pharmacological treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents,"It is increasingly recognized that bipolar disorder often first presents in adolescence. Preadolescents with volatile behavior and severe mood swings also comprise a large group of patients whose difficulties may fall within the bipolar spectrum. However, the preponderance of scientific effort and clinical trials for this condition has focused on adults. This review summarizes the complexity of bipolar disorder and the diagnosis of the illness among young people. It proceeds to review the principles of pharmacotherapy, evaluates current treatment options, and highlights areas where evidence-based guidance is lacking. Recent developments have expanded the range of possible treatments for bipolar disorder. However, differences in the phenomenology, course, and sequelae of bipolar disorder among youth call for greater attention to the benefits and drawbacks of therapy for those affected by early-onset bipolar disorder. By summarizing current research and opinion on diagnostic issues and treatment approaches, this review aims to provide an update on a clinically important but controversial topic.",0,0,
1372,Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium,"During the last 21 years since the birth of SP in the diagnostic nomenclature, there have been significant advances in knowledge about effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacological treatment, although good evidence shows the efficacy of benzodiazepines""; MAOIs;"" and anticonvulsant agents, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence for the efficacy of the newer antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism about the potential usefulness of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas that require more research. There has been much excitement over the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, which demonstrates the efficacy of fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Since SP begins in childhood and adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group because early intervention may prevent the sequelae of chronic SP. There needs to be more research into what is required for people with social phobia to have a good response to pharmacotherapy to go into full remission. Additional research is needed regarding the evaluation of the comparative efficacy of different drug classes and to develop an improved ability to predict treatment response for a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research on treatment resistance is needed. In most anxiety disorders that have been studied, the combination of CBT with psychopharmacological treatment has shown little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodological problems. Research is needed on how to sequence treatments to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of people who have had untreated SP their entire lives now presenting for treatment in their ""golden years."" Currently established treatments need to be further evaluated in this geriatric population.",0,0,
1373,Pharmacy Asthma Care Program (PACP) improves outcomes for patients in the community.,"Background: Despite national disease management plans, optimal management of asthma remains a challenge in Australia. Community pharmacists are in an ideal position to implement new strategies that aim to ensure that asthma care meets current best practice standards. The impact of the Pharmaceutical Asthma Care Program (PACP) on asthma control was assessed using a multisite randomized intervention repeated measures study design versus control. Methods: Fifty Australian pharmacies were randomized into two groups: intervention pharmacies implemented PACP (a continuous cycle of assessment, goal setting, monitoring and review) to 191 patients for 6 months, while control pharmacies provided their usual care. to 205 control patients. Both groups administered questionnaires and performed spirometric tests at baseline and 6 months later. The main outcome measure was asthma control status/severity. Results: 186 of 205 control patients (91%) and 165 of 191 intervention patients (86%) completed the study. The intervention resulted in better asthma control: patients who received the intervention were 2.7 times more likely to improve from 'severe' to 'not severe' than control patients (OR 2.68, 95% CI : 1.64 to 4.37""; p<0.001). The intervention also resulted in better adherence to preventive medication (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.30; p?= ?0.03), decrease in mean daily dose of reliever medication (difference -149.11 µg, 95% CI -283.87 to -14.36, p?=?0.03), a change in medication profile from reliever alone to a combination of prevention, reliever with or without long-acting ß-agonist (OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.40 to 10.32; p?=?0.01) and improved scores on risk of non-compliance (difference -0.44, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.18, P = 0.04), quality of life (difference -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to 0 .00, p = 0.05), asthma knowledge (difference 1.18, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.63, p<0.01), and perceived control of cue asthma questionnaires (difference -1.39, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.35; p<0.01). There were no significant changes in spirometric measurements in either group. Conclusions: A pharmacist-managed asthma care program based on national guidelines improves asthma control. The sustainability and implementation of the program within the health system remains to be investigated.",0,1,
1374,Physical activity under prescription (PAP) from the perspective of the general practitioner - a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Prescription physical activity (PAP) is a successful intervention to increase physical activity among patients with a sedentary lifestyle. The method appears to be used sparingly by general practitioners (GPs) and there is limited information on GP attitudes towards counseling using PAP as a tool. The aim of the study was to explore and understand the meaning of prescribing physical activity from the perspective of the general practitioner. METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 15 Swedish general practitioners in southern Sweden. Participants were invited to talk about their experience using PAP. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, analyzed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four categories: Tradition hinders attitude change, Shared responsibility is necessary, The PAP has a low status and is viewed with mistrust, and Lack of clear procedures and guidelines. Traditionally, GPs talk to patients about the importance of a higher level of physical activity, but do not prescribe physical activity as a treatment. Physician education focuses on the use of pharmaceuticals. Responsibility for the level of physical activity of patients is shared with other health professionals, the patient and society. GPs express reservations about prescribing physical activity. A heavy workload is a source of frustration. PAP is viewed with mistrust and considered a task of lesser value and status. Using a prescription to emphasize an increased level is considered redundant, and doctors believe it should be administered by someone else in the health care system. Skepticism was also expressed about the result of the method. CONCLUSIONS: There is uncertainty about the use of PAP as a treatment since clinicians lack education in non-pharmaceutical methods. GPs do not consider the written referral as a priority task and rather refer other professionals in the health system to prescribe PAP. GPs pointed out the need to create routines and arrangements for the method to gain credibility and become a daily practice among GPs.",0,0,
1375,Smoking Medical Advice for Teens: Who Gets the Advice and Who Benefits Most?,"PURPOSE: The Clinical Practice Guidelines instruct physicians to ask their patients about smoking and to discourage tobacco use. Physicians are especially urged to care for racial minorities and adolescents because of the increased susceptibility of these groups to smoking. Research on race and medical advice against smoking has produced conflicting results. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationships between physician communication about tobacco, race, and smoking among adolescents. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study explored (1) racial differences in rates of receiving physician communication and (2) whether the relationship between physician communication and smoking among adolescents was moderated by race. Multiple measures of smoking status (eg, intentions to quit, attempts to quit, quitters, relapse status) were used. We used a large sample (N = 5,154), predominantly African American (82.9%) of 11th graders. RESULTS: Regular smokers were more likely to be screened for smoking. African-Americans were discouraged from smoking more often than Caucasians. Among African Americans, non-smokers were more likely to be screened and counseled"";"" among Caucasians, regulars were more likely to be tested and counseled. Overall, physician intervention was associated with greater benefits for African American youth, including fewer intentions to smoke, more likely to quit, and fewer relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Physician communication about smoking may hold particular promise for African-American adolescents, reducing health disparities due to racial differences in smoking-related mortality and morbidity. Physicians should be encouraged to screen and counsel all youth about tobacco, regardless of race or smoking status.",0,0,
1376,Physician and patient predictors of evidence-based prescribing in heart failure: a multilevel study.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with heart failure (HF) must take into account the changing and complex individual clinical characteristics. The guidelines recommend the use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAAS-I) at target doses. But physicians appear to be insufficiently following this recommendation, while little is known about predictors of physician and patient adherence. METHODS: To examine the consistency of primary care physicians' (PC) self-perceived knowledge and competencies about RAAS-I with their respective prescribing behavior related to patient-associated barriers. Cross-sectional follow-up study after a randomized trial of educational medical intervention with an observation period of seven months. PC physicians (n = 37) and patients with systolic HF (n = 168) from practices in Baden-Württemberg. Measures were knowledge (blueprint-based multiple choice test), self-perceived competencies (global confidence in therapy and RAAS-I frequency of use questionnaire), and patient variables (age, gender, NYHA performance status , blood pressure, potassium level, kidney function). The prescription was obtained from the trial documentation. The target variable was >/=50% of the recommended dose of RAAS-I investigated using two-level logistic regression models. RESULTS: The patients (69% male, mean age 68.8 years) presented symptomatic and objectified left ventricle (NYHA II vs. III/IV: 51% vs. 49% and mean LVEF 33.3%) and renal (GFR/ =50%). of the improvement in the prescription of RAAS-I were the age of the patient (OR 0.95, CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.01), the global self-confidence of the doctor at follow-up (OR 1.09 , CI 1.02-1.05, p = 0.01) and NYHA class (II vs. III/IV) (OR 0.63, CI 0.38-1.05, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: A change in physician confidence as a predictor of RAAS-I dose escalation is a new finding that might reflect an improved physician intervention effect. ' and that it could encourage novel strategies to improve safe evidence-based prescribing, which should include knowledge, attitude and skills guidance.",0,0,
1377,Willingness of physicians and patients to pay for electronic management of cardiovascular diseases,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important target for electronic decision support. We examined the potential sustainability of an electronic CVD management program using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Our goal was to estimate physician and patient willingness-to-pay (WTP) for current and improved programs. METHODS: Focus groups, expert input, and literature searches decided on the attributes to be assessed for physician-patient ECDs, which were conducted using a web-based program. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis estimated preference coefficients for each respondent, and latent class analysis segmented each sample. Simulations were used to estimate the WTP for each of the attributes individually and for an improved vascular management system. RESULTS: 144 participants (70 physicians, 74 patients) completed the DCE. In general, speed of access to up-to-date records and monthly payments for a nurse coordinator were the main determinants of physician choice. Two distinctly different segments of physicians were identified: one highly sensitive to the monthly subscription fee and the speed of updating the tracker with new patient data, and the other highly sensitive to the monthly cost of the nurse coordinator and government billing incentives. Patient choices were most significantly influenced by annual subscription cost. Physician-estimated willingness-to-pay was slightly above the estimated threshold for sustainability, while patient-estimated willingness-to-pay was below. CONCLUSION: Current willingness to pay for electronic cardiovascular disease management should encourage innovation to provide economies of scale in program development, delivery, and maintenance to meet sustainability thresholds.",0,0,
1378,Physicians' attitudes toward the spread of optical spectroscopy devices for cervical cancer monitoring: an industry-academic collaborative study.,"BACKGROUND: Optical spectroscopy has been studied for biological plausibility, technical efficacy, clinical effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and cost effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: We seek to identify the attitudes or practices of health providers that could act as barriers or for the diffusion of this new technology. METHODS: Through an academic-industry partnership, we conducted a series of focus groups to examine medical barriers to optical diagnosis. The study was carried out in 2 stages. First, a pilot group of 10 physicians (8 OB-GYNs and 2 family physicians) from 8 regions of the United States were randomly selected and each physician was interviewed individually. Clinicians were presented with the results of a large trial (N = 980) that tested the accuracy of a spectroscopy-based device in detecting cervical neoplasia. They were also shown a prototype of the device and given a period of time to ask questions and receive answers about the device. They were also asked to provide feedback on a questionnaire that was later revised and presented to 3 larger focus groups (n=13, 15, and 17 for a total N=45). The largest focus groups were conducted during national scientific meetings with 20 obstetrician-gynecologists and 25 primary care physicians (family physicians and internists). RESULTS: When asked about the potential for diffusion of new cervical cancer screening technology, all study groups tended to rely on the established clinical guidelines of their respective professional societies regarding screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer. cervical cancer. Additionally, study participants agreed that real-time spectroscopy would be viewed positively by their patients. Participants were positive about the potential of the new technology as an adjunct to colposcopy, agreeing that improved accuracy would result in reduced healthcare costs (due to fewer biopsies and fewer visits). Although all participants saw the potential of real-time diagnostics, many barriers were perceived. These barriers included schedule and workflow changes, liability, documentation, ease of use, length of training, device cost, and third-party reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS: There are barriers to the diffusion of optical technologies in medical practice. These will need to be addressed before cervical screening and diagnostic programs can take advantage of spectroscopy-based tools for cancer control.",0,0,
1379,Physician behavior in the care of pediatric chronic diseases: association with health outcomes and adherence to treatment,"OBJECTIVE: Physician behavior is an important but understudied influence on children's and parents' adherence to medical treatment. METHOD: To address this need, research was reviewed in the following topic areas: children's and adolescents' perceptions of physicians' behavior in managing pediatric chronic diseases, parents' perceptions of physicians' behavior in managing pediatric chronic diseases; Physician adherence to pediatric chronic disease management guidelines; chronic disease management; communication of information by physicians on the treatment of pediatric chronic diseases; the relationship of medical behavior with adherence to treatment;"" and interventions to improve the management of pediatric chronic diseases by physicians. RESULTS: The findings highlight the discrepancies between the needs of parents and adolescents and the behavior of the physician, as well as inconsistencies in physician behavior, including adherence to practice guidelines, that may limit children's adherence to medical treatment.However, the results of interventions designed to improve the medical management of pediatric asthma have been CONCLUSIONS: Future research should be guided by a comprehensive model of physician behavior in chronic disease management that considers contextual determinants (eg, culture and socioeconomic status), identifies clinically relevant targets for intervention, and documents impact on outcomes. should be developed and evaluated Use approaches to chronic disease management that engage clinicians in active communication, support, and decision-making with children with chronic disease and their parents.",0,0,
1380,Medical intervention and patient risk perception among smokers with acute respiratory disease in the emergency department,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses account for more than 12 million visits to emergency departments in the United States each year. Between a quarter and a half of these patients are smokers. We examined the frequency of physician intervention to quit smoking among patients with acute respiratory illness in the emergency department, and examined the influence of physician intervention on patients' perceived risk of smoking and motivation to quit. . METHODS: This study was conducted in the emergency department of a large downtown hospital. Adult smokers (n = 63) presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory illness were surveyed by exit interview while in the emergency department. The frequency and extent of medical interventions for smoking cessation were examined using the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines as a model. We also assessed patients' perceptions of smoking risk, the presence of other smokers in the home, and patients' motivation to quit. RESULTS: Emergency department physicians provided an incomplete and inconsistent intervention for smoking. Although most patients reported being asked if they smoked, only half of the smokers were advised to quit. Only 9% were offered help to quit smoking. Risk perception was generally low, however, most smokers were willing to receive on-site smoking cessation counseling while in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The small sample size in this study requires that the results be interpreted with caution. However, the findings of this study suggest that the emergency department setting may provide a unique ""teachable moment"" in which to initiate smoking cessation counseling for this high-risk population.",0,0,
1381,Participation of the physician in the management of obesity as a primary medical condition,"As the obesity epidemic grows, the number of patients with serious comorbidities related to excess body weight is increasing. Obesity must be recognized and treated as a primary medical condition that is progressive, chronic, and relapsing. Effective treatment of obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and comorbid conditions. Physician involvement is necessary for medical evaluation, management, counseling, and coordination of multidisciplinary obesity treatment. Obese patients who receive weight control and counseling from physicians are much more likely to undertake weight control programs than those who do not. Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from various health organizations. A comprehensive weight management program should include dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavior modification. Nutritional modifications should take into account the energy content, composition, and suitability of the diet for the individual patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical, including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily lifestyle activities. Several behavioral strategies allow the patient to make lifestyle changes that will promote weight loss and weight control. Adjunctive therapies may serve to support lifestyle modifications in cases of severe or resistant obesity. Multidisciplinary care models vary depending on whether they are designed for an individual medical practice or as part of the health care services of a larger facility. Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management should be permanently incorporated into a patient's daily lifestyle to reduce obesity and associated health risks. Such intervention is necessary if the growing obesity epidemic is to be slowed and reversed.",0,0,

A randomized trial of continuing medical education,"To determine the effect of continuing medical education (CME) on adherence to the recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on high serum cholesterol levels in adults, we randomly assigned physicians primary care in 174 clinics to 3 groups, 2 who underwent standard treatment or intensive CME and a control group. The standard CME group was offered a free 3-hour seminar on elevated serum cholesterol levels; the intensive CME group was also offered follow-up seminars and free office supplies. After 18 months, we audited 13,099 medical records from the 140 practices that remained in the study. There were no significant differences (P > 0.15) in detection of high serum cholesterol or adherence to guidelines between groups receiving continuing medical education (51% detection; 33% compliance) and the control group (57% detection;"" 37% compliance). In the prespecified subgroup of patients with hypercholesterolemia, there was a trend toward modest benefit from education interventions continuous medical: compliance was 21% in the control group, 23% in the standard CME group, and 27% in the intensive CME group (p=0.07 overall).These results emphasize the need for best ways to change the behavior of practicing physicians and the importance of studying the implementation of preventive health recommendations.",0,0,
1383,Physician reimbursement for salary or fee for service: effect on medical practice behavior in a prospective randomized study.,"We used a resident continuity clinic to prospectively compare the impact of salary versus fee-for-service reimbursement on medical practice behavior. This model allowed for the randomization of physicians into salary and fee-for-service groups and the separation of the effects of reimbursement from patient behavior. Physicians reimbursed for fee-for-service scheduled more visits per patient than salaried physicians (3.69 visits vs. 2.83 visits, P less than 0.01) and saw their patients more often (2.70 visits vs. 2.21 visits, P less than 0.05) during the 9-month study. Almost all of this difference was due to fee-for-service physicians taking better care of patients than salaried physicians (1.42 visits and 0.99 visits per enrolled patient, respectively, P less than 0.01). Evaluation of visits according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines indicated that fee-for-service physicians saw more well-child care patients than salaried physicians because they missed fewer recommended visits and scheduled visits in excess of those recommendations. Fee-for-service physicians also provided better continuity of care than salaried physicians by attending a higher percentage of all visits made by their patients (86.6% of visits vs. 78.3% of visits, P less than 0.05) and by promoting fewer emergencies. visits per enrolled patient (0.12 visits vs. 0.22 visits, P less than 0.01). Physicians' interest in private practice, as determined by their career plans, was significantly correlated with the total number of patients enrolled (r = 0.48, P less than 0.05) and the total number of clinical patients served. for each resident during the study (r = 0.40). , P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,
1384,Physician response to computer reminders.,"A computerized medical record system was designed to detect and remind the responsible physician of clinical events that might require corrective action. These reminders significantly increased the physician's response rate (in terms of test orders and treatment changes) to the events in question.

1385,Physician responses to a community-wide trial promoting judicious use of antibiotics,"PURPOSE: In an environment of multiple campaigns promoting the judicious use of antibiotics in children, it is important to identify effective strategies. We assessed clinician responses to a community-level intervention regarding antibiotic prescribing, related practices, and perceived efficacy. METHODS: This study was a mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of a community-wide randomized controlled educational intervention in 16 Massachusetts communities. Physicians in the intervention communities received locally endorsed guidelines, group educational sessions, and bi-weekly newsletters. Parents received materials simultaneously at doctors' offices and by mail. After the intervention, we conducted a mailed medical survey and individual interviews to assess the impact of the intervention. We compared survey responses for intervention and control physicians, and analyzed interview transcripts to provide insights on selected topics. RESULTS: Among respondents (n = 168), 91% of intervention physicians and 4% of control physicians reported receiving intervention materials. The doctors received information from many other sources. More intervention than control physicians reported a decrease in antibiotic prescribing between 2000 and 2003 (75% vs. 58%, P = .03), but there were no differences between groups in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors. favor judicious use of antibiotics. Both groups were concerned about antibiotic resistance and reported room to reduce their own prescribing. Physicians interviewed suggested frequent repetition of messages, brief written materials on specific topics for themselves and patients, and promotion in the media as the most effective strategies to reduce prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Across multiple communities, an intervention in physician offices to promote judicious antibiotic prescribing reached its target audience, but physician self-reported attitudes and practices were similar in intervention and control communities. Campaigns that repeat short and consistent reminders to multiple stakeholder groups may be more effective in ensuring judicious use of antibiotics.",0,0,
1386,Medical screenings for multiple behavioral health risk factors,"BACKGROUND: Screening rates in primary care for unique behavioral health risk factors are well documented. However, such risk factors cluster in individuals and populations. This article examines the number and types of behavioral risk factors reported by US adults who reported being screened for at their last routine health checkup. METHODS: The sample consisted of 16,818 adults from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey who reported having had a routine checkup in the past year. Respondents completed questions about four behavioral risk factors (physical inactivity, overweight, smoking, risky alcohol use) and the provider's detection of behaviors related to these risk factors. RESULTS: Half of the sample (52.0%) reported having two or more of the four risk factors, and more than half (59.4%) were screened for two or more risk behaviors at their last control. routine, although 28.6% reported having been screened for none of them. Respondents who reported at least one risk factor were rated at an average of 57.7% of their own risk factors. Women, adults with lower income and education levels, and those older than 65 years reported being screened for fewer risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although risk factor screening and intervention guidelines generally focus on single behavioral risk factors, most primary care patients present with more than one and are evaluated. Behavioral risk factor screening tools and interventions need to be expanded to cover multiple risks. In addition, efforts are needed to reduce the substantial missed opportunities for screening and to eliminate demographic disparities in screening practices and accuracy.",0,0,
1387,"Physician, heal yourself: health maintenance behaviors among physicians","The objective of this article is to assess the need for health maintenance intervention programs aimed at physicians and patients. We compared the adherence to health maintenance behavior of physicians (as patients) with a population of control patients. An online survey was sent to the Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) School of Medicine's faculties of basic clinical and non-clinical sciences and non-TTUHSC physicians from the TTUHSC Medical Society. local county. The survey included questions about basic demographics and recent participation in regular health maintenance strategies, including annual checkup, flu vaccination, colonoscopy, Pap test, and mammography. Logistic regressions were performed to determine whether being a physician had a significant association with the likelihood of engaging in the health maintenance behavior outcomes listed above. This article shows that physicians are less likely than the general population to adhere to specific health maintenance guidelines: namely, annual checkups, colonoscopies, and mammograms. Pap test rates did not differ between physicians and a control population, but physicians were more likely to receive an influenza vaccine.",0,0,
1388,Medical-Industry Relations. Part 1: Individual Physicians,"This is part 1 of a two-part document on ethics and medical-industry relations. Part 1 offers advice to individual physicians"";"" Part 2 gives recommendations to medical education providers and medical professional societies. Physicians and industry have a shared interest in advancing medical knowledge. However, the primary ethic of the physician is to promote the best interests of the patient, while the primary ethic of the industry is to promote profitability. While physician-industry partnerships can result in impressive medical advances, they also create opportunities for bias and can lead to unfavorable public perceptions. Many doctors and doctors in training believe that they are immune to commercial influence. However, recent studies show that accepting gifts and hospitality from the industry, including drug samples, can compromise judgment of medical information and subsequent decisions about patient care. It is up to the doctor to judge whether a gift is acceptable. A very general guideline is that it is ethical to accept modest gifts that promote medical practice. It is clearly unethical to accept gifts or services that require the physician to reciprocate. Conflicts of interest may arise from other financial ties between physicians and industry, whether with outside companies or their own businesses. Such ties include fees for speaking or writing about a company's product, payment for participating in clinical research, and referrals to medical resources. All of these relationships have the potential to influence a physician's attitudes and practices. This document explores the ethical dilemmas involved and offers guidelines for ethical business relationships.",0,0,

1390,Physicians' health habits are associated with lifestyle counseling for hypertensive patients,"BACKGROUND: The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) recommended lifestyle interventions, with or without pharmacological treatment, for all patients with high blood pressure. The objective of this study is to determine the association of the personal habits of physicians with their attitudes and behaviors regarding the lifestyle modification guidelines of the JNC VII. METHODS: One thousand primary care physicians completed DocStyles 2010, a voluntary web-based survey designed to provide information on physician attitudes and behaviors regarding various health issues. RESULTS: The average age of the respondents was 45.3 years, and 68% were male. Regarding the behavior of the doctor, 4.0% smoked at least once a week, 38.6% ate >/=5 cups of fruits and/or vegetables >/=5 days/week and 27.4 % exercised >/=5 days/week. When asked about the specific types of advice offered to their hypertensive patients, physicians reported advising their patients to eat a healthy diet (92.2%), or reduce salt intake (96.1%), or who reached or maintained a healthy weight (94.8%). o limit alcohol consumption (75.4%), o be physically active (94.4%). Overall, 66.5% made all 5 lifestyle modification recommendations. Nonsmoking physicians were more likely to recommend each lifestyle intervention to their hypertensive patients. Those who exercised at least 1 day a week were more likely to recommend limiting alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of recommending the 5 JNC VII interventions was higher for physicians who did not smoke and who exercised at least 1 day per week.",0,0,
1391,Response of physicians to victims of domestic violence: towards a model of care,"Although current domestic violence guidelines, such as those published by the AMA in 1992, attempt to relieve clinicians of the ""full burden of intervention,"" they continue to ask them to play an important role in identification, intervention, and follow-up. in case of partner abuse. In this article, we define a limited domestic violence role for physicians that promotes the AMA-recommended direction and complements exemplary programs. We propose to simplify and limit clinicians' tasks to ""Asking patients about abuse,"" providing validation messages, acknowledging that abuse is wrong and confirming the patient's worth, documenting signs, symptoms, and disclosures that occur, and refer victims to specialists in domestic violence (AVDR). Drawing on the literature and our own experience, we show how focusing the physician's role on these four tasks is consistent with exemplary programs and expands on ideas put forth by experts to address domestic violence in health care settings, reduces barriers to medical interventions with the victims; offers a realistic approach for clinicians while reducing unrealistic educational demands;"" and complements managed care trends in contemporary health care.",0,0,
1392,Physicians' Understanding of Consent Requirements for Phase I Clinical Trials in Cognitively Impaired or Highly Vulnerable Populations,"We investigated clinicians' attitudes about admitting patients who are unable to give informed consent or who belong to a vulnerable population into clinical trials. A survey instrument asked a national sample of practicing physicians whether ten hypothetical patients could be enrolled in phase I clinical trials. The impact of demographic variables on the number of scenarios considered completely or somewhat acceptable was analyzed using Student's t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate. All significant variables (p<0.01) were entered into a multiple logistic regression model. Eighty-four percent of respondents indicated that at least one case scenario was acceptable. Most of those conducting clinical trials (62%), who had training in clinical research ethics (78%), and who serve on institutional review boards (IRBs) (83%) approved at least one case scenario. Doctors approved the entry of some patients who cannot give informed consent or who belong to a vulnerable population in clinical trials. The most effective education on guidelines involving clinical research should be available to practicing physicians, residents, and medical students. It must also be ensured that physicians conducting clinical trials or serving on IRBs have the necessary knowledge of the ethics of clinical research.",0,0,

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients at risk of cardiovascular events who might benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were identified from electronic data at a managed care and were randomized into 2 groups. Physicians attending outpatients in the intervention group were faxed a sheet containing the relevant patient data, including a recommendation to prescribe the indicated medication. In the control group, the technical sheet did not include the recommendation. The prescriptions dispensed were compared between the groups. RESULTS: More than 4000 visits were observed for each type of medication. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers were given at 7.1% of visits in the intervention group vs. 5.7% in the control group (P=0.048) after of the first doctor-patient encounter. No significant difference was seen for statins (intervention, 8.1% vs. control, 7.7%). Data from all doctor-patient encounters and both medications were combined in a logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was 1.19 for a prescription filled in the intervention group and 1.54 for 2 or more visits versus 1 visit. CONCLUSIONS: An automated system that provides relevant data and personalized recommendations for point-of-service care modestly increased prescription dispensing rates. Addressing patient-provider encounters to change provider behavior is challenging"";"" however, even small effects can produce clinically important results over time.",0,1,
1395,"Electronic Prompts at the Point of Care: An Effective Means to Increase Compliance, Demonstrate Quality, and Improve Outcomes","BACKGROUND: Incentives based on quality indicators, such as the basic measures of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP 1), encourage the implementation of evidence-based guidelines consistently in clinical practice.

1396,"Population-based interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection","BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 1999 there were 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that more than 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV in December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviors, such as frequent unprotected sex with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have shown a strong association between ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is also biological evidence that the presence of an STI increases the spread of HIV and that treatment of STIs reduces the spread of HIV (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the prevalence of HIV infection, the prevalence of STIs, and the quality of STI management. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized trials or reviews: 1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 2003 using the search terms 'sexually transmitted diseases' and 'human immunodeficiency virus infection'. 2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Effectiveness Reviews Abstracts Database and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, in the most recent edition of The Cochrane Library 3) The specialized register of trials maintained by the Cochrane Group of Infectious Diseases.4) EMBASE Relevant conference proceedings were searched and lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in which the randomisation unit is a community or a treatment centre. Studies in which individuals were randomized were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies and any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Trial reports were checked for completeness. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers, with details of the method of randomisation, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis, and number of patients lost to follow-up recorded, using the standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases. Group. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of STI treatment for all community members, the incident HIV infection rate ratio was 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1 .16), indicating that the intervention had no effect. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (enhanced syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared to 1.9% in the control groups (OR = 0 .58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.70), corresponding to a 38% (95% CI: 15% to 55%) reduction in HIV incidence in the intervention group. In the most recent trial by Kamali et al, the ratio of rates of behavioral intervention and STI management compared to HIV incidence control was 1.00 (0.63-1.58, p = 0, 98). These are consistent with the Rakai data showing no effect of the intervention. STI prevalence: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in reported gonorrhea, chlamydia, urethritis, or STI symptoms among the intervention communities. The prevalence ratio for syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.89), for trichmoniasis 0.59 (0.38 to 0.91) and bacterial vaginosis 0.87 (0.74 to 1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared to 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted r7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95% CI: 0.54-0.93). In Kamali et al, there was a significant decrease in cases of gonorrhea and active syphilis. The rate ratio for gonorrhea was 0.29 (0. 12-0.71, p=0.016), active syphilis was 0.53 (0.33-0.84, p=0.016).There was a trend to significance with the intervention on condom use with last partner casual""; the rate ratio was 1.27 (1.02-1.56, p = 0.036). Quality of treatment: In Lima, after training pharmacy assistants in the syndromic management of STIs, recognized that symptoms were due to an STI in 65% of standardized simulated patients (SSPs) visiting the intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting pharmacies control (p = 0.35). physician in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p=0.61). Of the SSPs that offered medication, only 1.4% of those who visited the intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those who visited the control pharmacies (p=0.57) were offered a regimen. recommended. Similarly, in only 15% and 16% of visits to the SSP, respectively, any recommended drug was offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be provided to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs. 27%, p = 0.01). No SSP was given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndrome monitoring and provision of STI syndrome packs containing recommended medicines, condoms, membership cards and patient information booklets) , SSPs were more likely to receive recommended medications at intervention clinics (83% vs. 12%, p<0.005) and were more likely to have case management correctly [with the correct medications, partner cards, and condoms] (88% vs. 50%, p<0.005). There were no significant differences in the proportions of adequate counseling (68% vs. 46%, p=0.06), good staff attitude (84% vs. 58%, p=0.07), and private consultation (92% vs. 86%, p=0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment seeking behaviour, service utilization or sexual behavior in any of the four trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improving STI treatment services has been shown to reduce HIV incidence in a setting characterized by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor, and where STIs have a high prevalence. There is no evidence of substantial benefit from treatment for all members of the community. The addition of the Kamali trial to the existing evidence supports the Rakai trial data of no effect. However, there are other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted, it can substantially improve the quality of services provided. The Kamali trial shows an increase in condom use, a marker of improved risk behaviors. Further community-based randomized controlled trials testing a variety of alternative STI control strategies in a variety of different settings are needed. Such trials should aim to measure a variety of factors including care-seeking behavior and quality of treatment, as well as HIV, STI, and other biological endpoints.",0,0,

1398,Population-level intervention strategies and examples for the prevention of obesity in children,"Since obesity affects an estimated 12.5 million young Americans, population-level interventions are indicated to help support healthy behaviors. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of population-level intervention strategies and examples of specific interventions that illustrate ways to help prevent and control obesity in children by improving nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Information is summarized within the settings where children live, learn, and play (early care and education, school, community, health care, home). Intervention strategies are activities or changes intended to promote healthy behaviors in children. They were identified from (a) systematic reviews""; (b) recommendations, guidelines or standards based on evidence and consensus of experts from non-governmental or federal agencies""; and finally (c) peer-reviewed synthesis reviews. The intervention examples illustrate how at least one of the strategies was used in a particular setting. To identify examples of interventions, we considered (a) peer-reviewed literature, as well as (b) additional sources with research-proven and practice-based initiatives. Researchers and practitioners can use this review to set priorities and promote integration across settings and to find research- and practice-proven intervention examples that can be replicated in their communities for childhood obesity prevention.",0,0,
1399,Positron emission tomography in gynecological cancer,"Most positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in gynecologic cancer are performed with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Contributes valuable information in primary staging of untreated advanced cervical cancer, post-treatment surveillance with unexplained tumor marker (such as squamous cell carcinoma antigen [SCC-Ag]) elevated or suspected of recurrence, and restaging of potentially curable recurrent cervical cancer. Its value in early-stage resectable cervical cancer is questionable. In ovarian cancer, FDG-PET provides benefits for those with stable or rising abnormal serum CA 125 (>35 U/mL), localized recurrence defined by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (CT-MRI) feasible for procedures local destructive (such as surgery, radiation therapy, or radiofrequency ablation); and clinical suspicion of recurrent or persistent cancer for which CT-guided biopsy cannot be performed. The role of FDG-PET in endometrial cancer is relatively less well defined due to a lack of data in the literature. In our prospective study, FDG-PET together with MRI-CT may facilitate optimal management of endometrial cancer in well-selected cases. Clinical impact was positive in 29 (48.3%) of 60 scans, 22.2% for primary staging, 73.1% for post-therapy surveillance, and 57.1% post-therapy rescue, respectively. Few studies have been reported on the management of vulvar cancer using FDG-PET. More data is needed. Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is quite unique in biological behavior and clinical management. Our preliminary results suggest that FDG-PET is potentially useful in selected gestational trophoblastic neoplasia by providing accurate metastatic mapping of tumor extent in advance, monitoring response, and locating viable tumors after chemotherapy. Evaluation of a diagnostic tool, such as PET, is usually done by comparing diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, etc.), using a more sophisticated receiver operating curve method, or modified treatment ratio . Evaluation of PET for clinical benefit is specific to the individual tumor and an attractive new end point.",0,0,

DESIGN Epidemiological modeling study. SETTING Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, Low-Income Diet and Nutrition Survey, Office for National Statistics, and health economic data from other published studies PARTICIPANTS 25-year-old adults, stratified by fifths for socioeconomic circumstance. INTERVENTIONS Total ban on trans fatty acids in processed foods""; enhanced labeling of trans fatty acids; ban on trans fatty acids in restaurants and takeaways. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Coronary heart disease deaths prevented or postponed; years of life gained; years of life quality-adjusted life earned . Policy costs to government and industry;"" policy savings from reductions in direct medical care, informal care, and lost productivity. FINDINGS A complete ban on trans-fatty acids in processed foods could prevent or postpone about 7,200 deaths (2.6%) from coronary heart disease between 2015 and 2020 and reduce inequality in mortality from coronary heart disease by about 3,000 deaths (15% ). Policies to improve labeling or simply remove trans fatty acids from restaurants/fast food could save between 1,800 (0.7%) and 3,500 (1.3%) deaths from coronary heart disease and reduce disparities between 600 (3% ) and 1,500 (7%) fatalities, making them half as effective at best. A full ban would have the largest net cost savings of around £265m ($361m, $415m) excluding reformulation costs, or £64m if substantial reformulation costs are incurred outside the regular cycle. CONCLUSIONS A regulatory policy to remove trans fatty acids from processed foods in England would be the most effective and equitable policy option. Intermediate policies would also be beneficial. However, simply continuing to rely on industry to voluntarily reformulate products could have negative health and economic outcomes.",0,0,
1403,Practical clinical trials in psychopharmacology: a systematic review,"Practical clinical trials (PCTs) are randomized experiments under typical practice conditions with the aim of testing the benefits and risks of therapeutic interventions in ""real life"". Influential PCTs have been performed in cardiology, oncology, and internal medicine. Psychotropic medications are widely and increasingly used in medical practice. This review examines recent progress in conducting PCT in psychopharmacology. We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from January 2000 to October 2014 for PCT peer-reviewed publications with at least 100 subjects per treatment group. Most PCTs in psychiatry evaluated mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapies. Of 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase during the observation period. The sample size ranged from 200 to 18,154"";"" only 11 studies randomized 500 patients or more. Psychopharmacology PCTs were just as likely to be funded by industry as by public agencies. There were 10 PCTs of antidepressants, for a total of 4206 patients (compared with at least 46 PCTs of antihypertensive medications, for a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as the primary outcome and produced efficacy and safety data that have influenced both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Practical clinical trials can be an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators, and policymakers, but have been relatively underutilized in psychopharmacology. Electronic medical records and integrated practice research networks offer promising platforms for more efficient PCT delivery.",0,0,

1405,Practice Changes Associated with the Department of Veterans Affairs Family Care Collaborative,"BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers rehabilitation to moderately to severely injured veterans through four regional Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs). To standardize and improve the care provided to family members of these veterans, health services researchers partnered with program leaders and rehabilitation specialists to implement a collaboration to improve the quality of family care. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in practice associated with the Family Care Collaborative intervention. DESIGN: Cross-site mixed methods evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the interdisciplinary rehabilitation team (n = 226) who work at the four participating sites. INTERVENTIONS: The collaboration developed and implemented in a 6-month pilot a web-based tool to standardize and promote family-centered care. RESULTS: Survey of Family Care Providers, Satisfaction with Family Care, and Perceived Competence in Working with Families""; Changes in Site-Specific Practices; Provider and Facilitator Perceptions of Collaborative Work""; and a validated measure to predict the probability of success of the selected intervention. MAIN RESULTS: Family-centered practices and satisfaction improved at sites with lower baseline scores (P < 0.05) and were equivalent across sites after the pilot. Providers initiated specific family-centered practices that often started at one site and spread to others through collaboration. Sites standardized family education and collaboration. Providers believed that collaboration produced a ""culture shift"" from patient-centered to family-centered care and viewed program leadership and involvement of health services researchers as crucial to success. Scores on the measure for predicting successful implementation of the intervention beyond the pilot were promising.

1407,Practice Doesn't Always Make Perfect: A Qualitative Study Explaining Why a Trial of an Educational Toolkit Didn't Improve Quality of Care,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a chronic disease commonly managed by family physicians, the most prevalent complication being cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to support physicians in the care of diabetic patients. We conducted a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a set of printed educational tools aimed at improving cardiovascular disease management in diabetes in primary care, and found no effect and indeed the possibility of some harm. . We conducted a qualitative evaluation to study the guideline implementation strategy used in this trial and to understand its effects. This paper focuses only on the qualitative findings, as the quantitative results of the RCT have already been reported elsewhere. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All family practices in the province of Ontario were randomly assigned to receive the educational toolkit by mail in either summer 2009 (intervention arm) or spring 2010 (control arm). . A subset of 80 GPs (representing approximately 10% of practices randomized and approached, with records of 1592 randomly selected patients with diabetes at high risk of CVD) then participated in a chart audit and related reflective feedback exercise. with their own practice compared to the guideline recommendations. They were asked to complete two forms (one pre-audit and one post-audit) to understand their knowledge of the pre-trial guidelines, their expectations regarding their individual pre-audit performance, and their reflections on the audit results. In addition, individual interviews were conducted with thirteen other family doctors. Verbatim data from interview transcripts and written comments from pre- and post-audit forms were subjected to qualitative descriptive analysis to identify common themes and patterns. The analysis revealed four main themes: impressions of the toolkit, awareness was not the problem, 'it's not me, it's my patients', and graph auditing as a more effective intervention than the toolkit. Participants saw neither the content of the toolkit nor its dissemination strategy as effective, indicating that they perceived themselves as aware of pre-trial guidelines. However, their accounts also indicated that they may be struggling to prioritize CVD management amid competing demands for their attention. Upon receiving the chart audit results, many participants expressed surprise that they had not performed better. They reported that the results of the audit would be an important motivator for behavior change. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative findings described in this paper offer important insights into why the intervention was not effective. They also demonstrate that physicians have unperceived needs in relation to CVD management and that the medical record audit served to identify deficiencies in their practice of which they had not previously been aware. The findings also indicate that new methods of intervention development and implementation should be explored.

1408,Practical Feedback Interventions: 15 Tips to Optimize Effectiveness,"Electronic practice data is increasingly being used to provide feedback to encourage practice improvement. However, the evidence suggests that, despite decades of experience, the effects of such interventions vary widely and do not improve over time. Guidance on how to provide more effective feedback exists, but it is distributed across a wide range of disciplines and theoretical perspectives. Through interviews with experts, systematic reviews, etc. and experience in providing, evaluating, and receiving practice feedback, 15 suggestions were identified that are believed to be associated with effective feedback interventions. These suggestions are intended to provide practical guidance to quality improvement professionals, information technology developers, educators, administrators, and practitioners who receive these types of interventions. Designing interventions with these suggestions in mind should enhance their effect, and studying the mechanisms underlying these suggestions will advance a stagnant literature.",0,0,

1410,Intentions of practicing nurses to use clinical guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that although nurses are increasingly using clinical guidelines to ensure higher quality care, there is wide variation in compliance. The usefulness of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has not been previously investigated to explain this variation in community nursing. OBJECTIVE: This article reports on a study whose primary objective was to examine the usefulness of TPB in explaining variations in practice nurses' intentions to offer smoking cessation advice according to coronary heart disease guidelines. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through a postal questionnaire. A 52-item questionnaire was administered to 48 practicing nurses in England. The questionnaire was designed to assess components of the TPB and included measures of intentions to offer smoking cessation advice, self-reported past behavior, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral controls (PBC), behavioral beliefs and evaluations, normative beliefs, and motivation. to comply with and control beliefs and evaluations. RESULTS: The TPB explained up to 40% of the variation in intentions to offer advice to stop smoking. Attitudes and PBCs were the most important predictors of intention. Among other elements of the TPB, indirect attitudes and indirect PBCs made significant positive contributions to explain variation in intention. DISCUSSION: Future trials of interventions to increase adherence to clinical guidelines by practicing nurses could attempt to address the elements identified in this study as important factors. Further studies are required to examine the usefulness of the TPB in predicting the behavior of practicing nurses.",0,0,
1411,Practical parameters for the non-pharmacological treatment of chronic insomnia. A report from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Practice Standards Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint reported to physicians. Treatment has traditionally consisted of medication. Behavioral approaches have been available for decades, but lack of physician knowledge and training, difficulty in obtaining reimbursement, and doubts about efficacy have limited their use. These practice parameters review the current evidence regarding a variety of nonpharmacologic treatments for insomnia. Using a companion article providing a background review, the available literature was reviewed. Evidence was graded according to previously reported criteria from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine with references to the American Psychological Association criteria. Treatments considered include: stimulus control, progressive muscle relaxation, paradoxical intention, biofeedback, sleep restriction, multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, imagery training, and cognitive therapy. Improved experimental design has significantly advanced the process of evaluating nonpharmacologic treatments for insomnia using the guidelines outlined by the American Psychological Association (APA). Recommendations for individual therapies using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendation levels for each are: ""stimulus control (standard)""; progressive muscle relaxation, paradoxical intention, and biofeedback (guidelines); sleep restriction and behavioral therapy multicomponent cognitive (options);"" Sleep hygiene education, imagery training, and cognitive therapy did not have sufficient evidence to recommend them as sole therapy. The optimal duration of treatment, who should perform the treatments, long-term outcomes and safety issues, and the effect of treatment on quality of life are questions that need future research.",0,0,
1412,Practice-level effects of interventions to improve asthma care in primary care settings: the Pediatric Asthma Care Patient Outcomes Research Team.,"Goal. To assess the practice-level effects of (1) a peer medical leader intervention and (2) peer leader in combination with the introduction of asthma education nurses to facilitate improved care. And, to compare the findings with previously reported patient-level outcomes from those enrolled in the trial. study environment. We included data on children aged 5 to 17 years with asthma in 40 primary care practices, affiliated with managed care plans enrolled in the Pediatric Asthma Care Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) randomized trial. Study design. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to one of two care improvement arms or to usual care. Automated claims data was analyzed over 12-month periods using a repeated cross-sectional design. The primary outcome was evidence of at least one dispensed controller medication among patients with persistent asthma. Secondary outcomes included controller use among all identified asthmatics, evidence of chronic controller use, and oral steroid use. Health service utilization outcomes included the number of outpatient visits and hospital events. Main findings. The proportion of children with persistent asthma prescribed controllers increased in all study arms. No effect of the interventions was detected on the proportion receiving controllers (peer leader intervention effect 0.01, 95 percent confidence interval [CI] -0.07, 0.08""; intervention effect of planned care -0.03, 95 percent CI: -0.09, 0.02) A statistical trend was observed towards a greater number of bursts of oral corticosteroids administered in the intervention practices Significant adjusted increases were observed in outpatient visits from 0.08 to 0.10 visits per child per year in the first year of intervention, but a statistical trend in these results only persisted in the second year of follow-up.No differences in hospital events were detected. This analysis showed a slight increase in asthma outpatient visits as a result of interventions to improve asthma care, using automated data.The absence of a detectable impact on medication use practice-level cough differs from the positive effect of the intervention observed in patient self-reported data of trial participants. Automated data analysis on non-enrollees aggregates insights into the practice-level impact of care improvement strategies. The benefits of practice-level interventions may accrue disproportionately for the subgroup of trial participants. The effect of such interventions may be less evident at the level of practices or health plans.",0,1,

The goal of the workshop was to identify crucial knowledge gaps and to suggest scientific priorities and best practices for the use of animal models in the preclinical evaluation of potential new RTT therapies. This review summarizes the results of the workshop and the extensive follow-up discussions among participants, and includes: (1) a comprehensive summary of the physiological and behavioral phenotypes of RTT mouse models to date, and the areas in which require further phenotypic analyzes to improve the utility of these models for translational studies""; (2) discussion of the impact of genetic differences between mouse models and methodological differences between laboratories, on the expression and analysis, respectively, of phenotypic traits;"" and (3) definitions of standards that the RTT research community can implement for rigorous preclinical study design and transparent reporting to ensure that decisions to initiate expensive clinical trials are based on reliable preclinical data.",0,0,
1414,Precommitting to choose wisely about low-value services: a randomized stepped wedge cluster test.,"Background Little is known about how to discourage physicians from ordering low-value services. Our goal was to test whether clinicians who committed in the future (ie, previously committed) to following Choosing Wisely recommendations with decision support could decrease potentially low-value orders. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month, cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial among 45 primary care physicians and advanced practice providers at six adult primary care clinics of a US community group practice, imaging for sore throats. uncomplicated head and unnecessary antibiotics for acute sinusitis. Pre-engaged physicians received 1 to 6 months of point-of-care pre-engagement reminders, as well as patient education brochures and weekly emails with resources to support communication about low-value services. The primary outcome was the difference between the control and intervention period percentages of visits with potentially low value orders. Secondary outcomes were the differences between the percentages of visits with potential alternative orders between the control and intervention periods, and the differences between the percentages of visits with potentially low-value orders between the control period and the subsequent follow-up period. to the 3-month intervention. Results The intervention was not associated with a change in the percentage of visits with potentially low value orders overall, for headaches or acute sinusitis, but was associated with an overall increase of 1.7% in alternate orders (p=0 .01). For low back pain, the intervention was associated with a 1.2% decrease in the percentage of visits with potentially low value orders (p=0.001) and a 1.9% increase in the percentage of visits with alternate orders (p=0.001). p=0.007). No changes were maintained at follow-up. Conclusion Physicians' prior commitment to following the Choosing Wisely recommendations was associated with a small non-sustained decrease in potentially low-value orders for only one of the three specific conditions and may have increased alternative orders.",1,1,
1415,Predicting adherence to medical guidelines: an assessment of motivators and perceived barriers,"BACKGROUND: Although clinical practice guidelines are widely accepted as ""best practice,"" provider compliance remains low. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between providers' behavioral intentions and their adherence to practice guidelines; assess the impact of perceived barriers that most inhibited compliance; and to examine the ability of factors in the Physician Guideline Compliance Model to predict intent to comply and adherence to implemented guidelines at specific practice sites. METHODS: Survey research methods were used to assess the effects of antecedents (attitudes, subjective norms, past behavior, and perceived behavioral control) on providers' intentions to meet and adhere to clinical practice guidelines. Supplier survey I was conducted at the time of guideline introduction and survey II 4 months after implementation. RESULTS: Behavioral history and behavioral intention scores reflected favorable responses toward use of the guidelines. Median self-reported compliance behavior was 65%, while compliance assessed by chart review was 54%. Approximately 68% of the variation in physician behavioral intentions was due to variables included in the Physician Guideline Compliance Model. A significant negative correlation was found between perceived barriers and self-reported behavior, but not between perceived barriers and behavior assessed by chart review. CONCLUSIONS: Some variables, particularly perceived barriers to guideline implementation, predicted a provider's practice intentions and self-reported behavior. Future guideline intervention efforts should identify and reduce these barriers to guideline compliance prior to implementation.",0,0,
1416,Type 2 diabetes risk prediction in England and Wales: prospective derivation and QDScore validation.,"OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a new diabetes risk algorithm (the QDScore) to estimate the 10-year risk of developing type 2 diabetes diagnosed over a 10-year period in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population. DESIGN Prospective open-label cohort study using routinely collected data from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the score. PARTICIPANTS 2,540,753 patients aged 25-79 years in the referral cohort, who contributed 16,436,135 person-years of observation and of whom 78,081 had incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes""; 1,232,832 patients (7,643,037 person-years -person) in the validation cohort, with 37,535 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. OUTCOME MEASURES A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effects of risk factors in the derivation cohort and derive an equation of ethnicity, age, gender, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, underlying disease were self-assigned in the final model. cardiovascular disease and the current use of corticosteroids;"" the outcome of interest was incident diabetes recorded in general practice registers. Calibration and discrimination measures were calculated in the validation cohort. RESULTS There was a four- to five-fold variation in the risk of type 2 diabetes among different ethnic groups. Compared with the white control group, the adjusted hazard ratio was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) for Pakistani women, and 2.54 (2.20 to 2.93) for Pakistani men. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher risk rates than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women were at increased risk compared to the corresponding white reference group. In the validation data set, the model explained 51.53% (95% confidence interval, 50.90 to 52.16) of the variation in women and 48.16% (47.52 to 48, 80) in men. The risk score showed good discrimination, with a D statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) in women and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) in men. The model was well calibrated. CONCLUSIONS The QDScore is the first risk prediction algorithm that estimates 10-year diabetes risk based on a prospective cohort study and includes both social deprivation and ethnicity. The algorithm does not need laboratory tests and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public through a simple web calculator (www.qdscore.org).",0,0,

DESIGN Prospective study of older women in residential care for two years. SETTING 21 private or 38 local authority nursing homes and 4 geriatric hospitals in Doncaster and Hull. SUBJECTS 1414 Outpatient women over 69 years of age, in private or municipal residential care or in geriatric care. Those who had undergone bilateral hip surgery were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) index, Clifton assessment procedures for the test of old age (for knowledge), and mobility on a six-point scale, and hip fracture in the subsequent two-year period . RESULTS 73 women fractured their hips during the two years. Their mean age was not significantly different from that of women who did not sustain a fracture (85.3 (SD 5.6) vs. 83.9 (6.3)""; p = 0.07), but their BUA index mean (40.3 (19.3) vs. 50.9 (22.2) ) db/MH2), and knowledge score (median 19 (interquartile range 10.5-27.0) v 24 (17- 30)) were significantly lower (both p less than 0.001), these variables had independent associations with hip fracture Women with fractures scored significantly lower on the psychomotor component of the knowledge test (4.5 (1 -8) vs. 7 (2-10), p less than 0.0025 and were significantly more mobile (1(1-3) vs. 3 (1-6), p less than 0.02). according to high, medium and low scores for the BUA index and knowledge tests revealed a high-risk group (118 women) with low BUA index and knowledge score, whose incidence of fracture was 12.8%;"" in the group C With the lowest risk (136 women) with a high BUA index and knowledge score, the incidence of fracture was only 1.5% (relative risk 8.4 (95% confidence interval -2.0 to 35.5) . Further analysis showed that those at highest risk were also the most mobile, but that the least mobile women with good knowledge had a low incidence of fractures, regardless of the BUA index (1.2%, high index, vs. 0). .9%, low rate). CONCLUSIONS Elderly women at highest risk for hip fractures were those with a low BUA index, low knowledge test score, and high mobility. Improving bone strength and consciousness in older women may reduce the incidence of hip fracture.",0,0,
1418,Predictors of Colorectal Cancer Screening for Patients Enrolled in a Managed Care Health Plan,"BACKGROUND: Despite growing recognition of the importance of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in reducing cancer mortality, national screening rates are low, indicating a critical need to understand the barriers and remedies for the underuse of CRC detection tests. METHODS: Using results from independent cross-sectional telephone surveys of patients aged ≥50 years conducted before (2000""; n = 498) and after (2003; n = 482) a quality improvement intervention for CRC detection within from a large managed care health plan, trends and predictors of CRC detection with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and/or endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) were examined from the patient's perspective. RESULTS: In 2000, patient-reported detection rates within guidelines were 38% for any test, 23% for endoscopy, and 22% for FOBT In 2003, detection rates increased to 50% for any test, 39% for endoscopy and 24% for FOBT Discussing CRC with a physician significantly increased the odds of being screened (FOBT: odds ratio [OR], 2.09 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.47 -2.96], endoscopy: OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1, 67-3.26]; and any test: OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 2.06-3.96]), and reporting barriers for CRC generally reduced the odds of being screened (FOBT: OR, 0 .76 [95% CI, 0.60-0.95]; endoscopy: OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60-0.92]"" and any test: OR, 0.66 [CI 95%, 0.54-0.80]. CONCLUSIONS: Although screening rates increased over the 3-year period, evidence of continued underuse of CRC screening was found. CRC were the influence of provider and patient barriers related to CRC detection in general, pointing to the need for multilevel interventions directed at both the provider and the patient.",0,0,
1419,Predictors of fatigue 30 days after completion of adjuvant anthracycline plus taxane chemotherapy for breast cancer,"PURPOSES/OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of fatigue 30 days after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and whether differences are observed between a behavioral sleep intervention and a healthy eating attention control group in predicting fatigue. DESIGN: Descriptive, exploratory, secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Oncology outpatients in a Midwestern US city SAMPLE: 96 women, ages 29-83 years, 72% married, 95% white, diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer, receiving chemotherapy adjuvant with anthracyclines and taxanes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a behavioral sleep intervention group or an attention control group. Participants completed data collection before and during the peak and rebound days of the initial chemotherapy treatment cycle and after the last treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, circadian rhythms of activity, objective and subjective sleep-wake, and objective and subjective activity-rest. FINDINGS: Predictors of fatigue were less total sleep time before treatment, greater fatigue before treatment and at peak, and less energy upon awakening on recovery days. In the control group, the predictors of increased fatigue were greater fatigue before treatment, higher body mass index, greater number of positive lymph nodes, and less daytime dysfunction. For the intervention group, lower maximal activity at the initial treatment peak differentially predicted fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that participants in the sleep intervention group who maintained activity balanced with sleep at the peak of initial treatment benefited more from the intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should assess fatigue before initial chemotherapy treatment and at regular intervals, further assess sleep deprivation in patients reporting fatigue of 4 or more (on a scale of 0 to 10), and use guidelines based on on the evidence to select appropriate interventions.",0,0,
1420,Predictors of Provider Recommendation for HPV Vaccine Among Young Adult Men and Women: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Survey,"BACKGROUND: Although physician recommendation is one of the strongest predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, it is unclear for whom physicians recommend the vaccine. To help guide intervention efforts, this study investigated predictors of participant-reported medical recommendation for HPV vaccination among young adults in the US. METHODS: Women and men (N=223) ages 18 to The 26-year-old was recruited online through Craigslist, a popular classifieds website. The ads ran in the 25 largest US cities from September 2013 through March 2014. Participants completed a survey that assessed demographic and sociopolitical characteristics, sexual history, HPV vaccination history, and whether had ever received a recommendation for the HPV vaccine from a doctor or health care provider. supplier. RESULTS: 53% reported having received an HPV vaccine recommendation and 45% had received >/= 1 dose of HPV vaccine. Participants who received a recommendation were more than 35 times more likely to receive >/= 1 dose of HPV vaccine compared to participants without a recommendation. Bivariate and multivariate correlates of provider recommendation were identified. Results from the multivariable model indicated that younger white (age 18 to 21), female, with health insurance (ie, employer-sponsored or some other type, such as military-sponsored) participants were more likely to to report that they received a recommendation for the HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that clinician-recommended practices for HPV vaccination vary by patient characteristics. The findings underscore the key role of the health care provider in promoting HPV vaccination and have important implications for future HPV vaccination interventions with young adults.",0,0,
1421,Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015: Construction and Explanation,"Systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols allow planning and documentation of review methods, guard against arbitrary decision-making during the conduct of the review, allow readers to assess the presence of selective reporting versus completed reviews, and, when made publicly available, reduce duplication of effort and potentially speed up collaboration. Evidence is accumulating documenting selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics, and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to correct these problems, including the development of an international registry for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and the launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols. (BioMed Central Systematic Reviews). Continuing these efforts and based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guide to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic reviews and meta-analyses. protocols--PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015.

1422,Prescribing habits of general practitioners in choosing an empiric antibiotic regimen for lower respiratory tract infections in adults in Sicily,"The survey was carried out, between September 1995 and May 1996, in order to describe the prescriptive behavior among Sicilian general practitioners (GP) in choosing an empirical antibiotic regimen for LRTI in adult patients and to start an educational process that involves the same doctors in the decisions. with respect to your prescriptions and in compliance with local guidelines. Each physician completed a questionnaire for each therapeutic intervention that ended with the prescription of an antibiotic. The questionnaire also inquired about the characteristics of the patient, diseases to be treated and medication prescription. Physicians were asked to give their opinion on the assessment of the severity of the infectious disease before choosing antibiotic treatment, in order to assess the prescribing behavior of physicians in relation to the patient's symptoms. Of all the Sicilian general practitioners contacted, 76 physicians from 25 Sicilian cities, with a patient population of 96,630, agreed to participate. The doctors used 49 different molecules and six different combinations of two antibiotics. The most used antibacterial agents were cephalosporins (55.0%). Penicillins (11.7%), fluoroquinolones (11.4%), macrolides (10.1%), and combinations of penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors (7.9%), together, accounted for 41.1 % of the rest of antibiotic prescriptions. The choice of the route of administration was significantly influenced by the age of the patients, by the symptoms and signs of the disease, and by the presence of concurrent diseases rather than by bacteria suspected of causing the disease. The quite marked variation in the pattern of prescription of antibiotics for LRTI among Sicilian doctors reflects the lack of availability or knowledge of local or national guidelines on the management of these diseases.",0,0,
1423,Prescription data as a tool in pharmacotherapeutic audit (I). General considerations,"This article looks at how prescribing data that is available from pharmacies can be used as a tool to support the improvement of prescribing behaviour. For optimal use of prescription data in pharmacotherapeutic audit, the specific purpose of the audit meeting should be clear. Then, the appropriate measures (quality of drug choice, volume, cost) should be selected for presentation and discussion of the prescription. For various objectives of audit meetings, suggestions for appropriate measures are given. For each stage of behavior change, the article describes why and how prescription data can provide a useful contribution. Finally, recommendations are given on the prerequisites for the optimal use of prescription data. The important factors are that the prescribing data must sufficiently cover the physicians' patient population, information on the extent of repeat prescribing is needed, and prescribing drugs with multiple indications may cause difficulties with graph interpretation. With this information in mind, prescribing feedback can be tailored to the needs of the audit teams and oriented to the intended intervention.",0,0,

We review here 1,357 cases consulted from January 2011 to December 2013. The aim of the study is to determine whether emergency physicians prescribe nPEP according to national guidance with the support of IDS (infectious disease specialists). As this intervention has a high cost, we wanted to verify the correct allocation of treatment to high-risk patients. In addition, we wanted to determine whether adherence to nPEP when prescribed by an emergency physician differed from reports in the literature. Finally, we wanted to describe the population that consults for nPEP in our center. Emergency physicians prescribed nPEP more frequently in high-risk exposures (98.6%) compared to intermediate-risk exposures (53.2%)"";"" properly allocate resources from a public health perspective. The appropriateness of the prescription when assessed according to the Belgian nPEP guidelines was 98.8%. Compliance with nPEP prescribed by emergency physicians was 60% in our study. Compliance was highest in MSM (Men who have sex with men), while sexual assault victims showed the lowest compliance. Taken together, this study suggests that emergency physicians can safely and appropriately prescribe nPEP when supported by comprehensive guidance. Recognizing intrinsic differences within heterogeneous populations consulting for nPEP may improve adherence to this high-cost public health intervention.",0,0,
1425,Prescription Omega-3s: An Overview for Nurse Practitioners,"Nurse practitioners (NPs) often take a multidisciplinary approach when treating and educating patients. Collaboration with a registered dietitian is not uncommon when treating patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides [TG] >/= 500 mg/dL). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia should be treated and managed to normalize TG levels (TG level <150 mg/dL). Treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia is usually threefold, including lifestyle changes, diet modification, and drug therapy. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are usually the first step in lowering TG levels. Registered dietitians promote a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Evidence has been mounting to support the use of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to lower TG. When lifestyle and dietary changes do not effectively reduce TG, NPs will recommend drug therapy as the next step. A viable drug option includes prescription omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (P-OM3). Each 4 g/d dose of P-OM3 provides 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid. Clinical trials show that P-OM3 can lower TG by 45% safely and effectively in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Nurses play an important role in the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia and in educating patients about lifestyle and dietary changes that can have a major impact on patients' health.",0,0,

SUBJECTS 197 asymptomatic women who attended their general practitioner for cervical smear tests and 101 randomly selected patients who attended the colposcopy clinic for investigation of abnormal smears. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of various sexually transmitted infections determined by culture and serological tests. RESULTS Of the 101 women with cytologic abnormalities, six had current culture-proven chlamydial infection and none had gonococcal infection"";"" Of the 197 women with normal smears, 24 (12%) had a chlamydial infection and two had gonorrhea. Serologic studies for Chlamydia trachomatis-specific antibody also indicated that a large proportion of patients had been exposed to this agent in both groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in the prevalence of any of the sexually transmitted diseases studied. CONCLUSION A high prevalence of chlamydial infection is present in women in North West Glasgow, irrespective of their cervical cytological status.",0,0,
1429,Prevalence of Nonpolypoid Colorectal Neoplasms (Flat and Depressed) in Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Adults,"Context Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Prevention has focused on the detection and elimination of polypoid neoplasms. Data on the importance of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms (NP-CRN) are limited. Objectives To determine the prevalence of NP-CRN in a hospital population of veterans and to characterize its association with colorectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients Cross-sectional study at a California VA hospital with 1,819 patients undergoing elective colonoscopy from July 2003 to June 2004. Main outcome measures Endoscopic appearance, location, size, histology, and depth of invasion of neoplasms. Results The overall prevalence of NRC-NP was 9.35% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.05%-10.78%""; n = 170). The prevalence of NRC-NP in the subpopulations for screening, surveillance, and symptoms was 5.84% (95% CI, 4.13%-8.00%; n = 36), 15.44% (95% CI, 12.76%-18, 44%; n = 101) and 6.01% (95% CI, 4.17%-8.34%; n = 33), respectively.The overall prevalence of NP-CRN with infiltrating carcinoma in situ or submucosal was 0.82% (95% CI, 0.46%-1.36%; n = 15); in the screening population, the prevalence was 0.32% (95% CI, 0.04%- 1.17%; n = 2).Overall, NP-CRNs were more likely to contain carcinoma (odds ratio, 9.78; 95% CI, 3.93-24.4) than polypoid lesions, regardless Size-adjusted positive association of NP-CRNs with invasive carcinoma in situ or submucosal was also observed in subpopulations for screening (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.27-15.3) and surveillance (odds ratio, 63.7; 95% CI , 9.41-431). The depressed type had the highest risk (33%). Nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasms containing carcinoma were smaller in diameter compared with polypoids (mean [SD] diameter, 15.9 [10.2] mm vs. 19.2 [9.6] mm, respectively). Procedure times did not change appreciably compared to historical controls. Conclusion In this group of veteran patients, NP-CRNs were relatively common lesions diagnosed during routine colonoscopy and had a greater association with carcinoma compared with polypoid neoplasms, regardless of size.",0,0,
1430,"Prevalence of war-related mental health conditions and association with displacement status in post-war Jaffna district, Sri Lanka.","Context Nearly 2.7 million people around the world are internally displaced (seeking refuge in safe areas of their own country) annually by armed conflict. Although the psychological impact of war has been well documented, less is known about the mental health symptoms of forced displacement among IDPs. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of the most common war-related mental health conditions, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety and depression, and to assess the association between displacement status and these conditions in the district of Post-war Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Design, setting, and participants Between July and September 2009, a multi-stage cross-sectional cluster survey was conducted among 1,517 households in the Jaffna district, including 2 IDP camps. The response rate was 92% (1448 respondents, 1409 eligible respondents). Two percent of participants (n=80) were currently displaced, 29.5% (n=539) had recently resettled, and 68.5% (n=790) were long-term residents. Bivariate analyzes followed by multivariate logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between displacement status and mental health. Main outcome measures PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptom criteria measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist¨C25. Results Overall prevalences of PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-9.7%), 32.6% (95% CI, %, 28.5%-36.9%) and 22.2% (95% CI, 18.2%-26.5%), respectively. Currently displaced participants were more likely to report PTSD symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 2.71""; 95% CI, 1.28-5.73), anxiety (OR, 2.91; 95% CI , 1.89-4.48) and depression (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 2.47-8.39) compared with long-term residents.Recently resettled residents were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.11-3.47) compared with long-term residents.However, commuting was no longer associated with mental health symptoms after controlling for exposure Conclusion Among residents of the Jaffna district of Sri Lanka, the prevalence of symptoms of war-related mental health conditions was substantially and significantly associated with displacement status and exposure to underlying trauma.",0,0,
1431,Prevention and management of the lack of professionalism in the faculties of medical schools,"Professionalism is a required competency for medical students, residents, practicing physicians, and academic professors. Faculty members must adhere to codes of conduct or risk discipline. The authors describe problems of lack of professionalism that culminate in reports of faculty misconduct or grievances in academic medicine and describe strategies for early intervention and prevention. The authors, vice and associate deans and executive director of the office of faculty affairs at a large US medical school, have handled many complaints of unprofessional conduct over the past decade. They present case examples based on behaviors such as disrespect, inappropriate language and behavior, lack of cooperation with members of the health care team, and sexual harassment/discrimination. They discuss factors that complicate the evaluation of these behaviors, including varying definitions of respect, different cultural norms, and false accusations. The authors make recommendations for prevention and intervention, including early identification, performance management, sexual harassment education, and referrals to professional coaches, anger management classes, and teacher assistance programs.",0,0,
1432,Caries prevention in young children from Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York: perspectives from mothers and pediatricians.,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood caries is common in South Asian immigrant families. Few children visit the dentist at 12 months, as current guidelines recommend. The pediatric visit has important potential to link children to preventive care. The aim of this study was to understand the barriers and facilitators to caries prevention in young children from Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York. Qualitative data were collected as a preliminary step in the development of an oral health counseling intervention for South Asian children. BASIC DESIGN: Qualitative interviews on infant feeding and oral health prevention were conducted with mothers from Bangladesh. Qualitative interviews were conducted with pediatricians about their experiences in providing care. Data were analyzed using standard qualitative approaches. SETTING: Pediatric practices serving low-income Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 26 mothers of children 6-24 months receiving services in five pediatric settings and 15 pediatricians providing care in these settings. RESULTS: Both mothers and their pediatricians described unsafe feeding practices, communication problems, and noncompliance. The oral health of young children was a low priority for some mothers. Most, however, were concerned about childhood caries but lacked the skills or resources to reduce caries risk. CONCLUSIONS: The results support our plan to develop an empowerment-based counseling intervention to address caries risk in children. Pediatric dentists should be aware of the barriers to caries prevention in this group.",0,0,
1433,Preventing child abuse and neglect with a nurse home visiting program: the limiting effects of domestic violence,"Context Home visits to families with young children have been promoted as an effective way to prevent child maltreatment, but few studies have examined the conditions under which such programs meet this goal. Objective To investigate whether the presence of domestic violence limits the effects of nurse home visiting interventions in reducing substantiated reports of child abuse and neglect. Design Fifteen-year follow-up study of a randomized trial. Setting Semi-rural community in upstate New York. Participants Of 400 socially disadvantaged pregnant women with no previous live births consecutively enrolled between April 1978 and September 1980, 324 mothers and their infants participated in the follow-up study. Interventions Families were randomized to receive routine perinatal care (control group; n = 184 participated in follow-up), routine care plus nursing home visits during pregnancy only (n = 100), or routine care plus home visits by nurses during pregnancy and up to the child's second birthday (n = 116). Main outcome measures Number of substantiated reports over the entire 15-year period involving the study child as the subject regardless of the identity of the perpetrator or involving the mother as the perpetrator regardless of the identity of the child extracted from state records and analyzed by treatment group and level of domestic violence in the home as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scale. Results Families receiving home visits during pregnancy and childhood had significantly fewer reports of child maltreatment involving the mother as the perpetrator (P = 0.01) or the study child as the subject (P = 0.04) than those families who did not receive home visits. The number of reports of abuse from mothers who received home visits during pregnancy did not differ from the control group. For mothers who received visits up to the child's second birthday, the treatment effect decreased as the level of domestic violence increased. Of women who reported 28 or fewer incidents of domestic violence (79% of the sample), mothers who visited the home had significantly fewer reports of child maltreatment over the 15-year period than mothers who did not receive the longer intervention term (P = 0.01). However, this intervention did not significantly reduce child maltreatment among mothers who reported more than 28 incidents of domestic violence (21% of the sample). Conclusions The presence of domestic violence may limit the effectiveness of interventions to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect.",0,0,
1434,Prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke with aggressive statin therapy in older adults using a team management model,"PURPOSES: The purposes of this review were to highlight the results of recent clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in adults aged 65 years and older and to examine how nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) work together with physicians as a team, they can better serve the needs of this fastest growing subset of the US population that is at high risk for cardiovascular events, including stroke. DATA SOURCES: This report was compiled by reviewing the scientific literature on the safety and efficacy of statin therapy, including effects on cardiovascular, coronary, and stroke endpoints, with particular reference to the results of clinical trials in older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recent guidelines emphasize that age alone is not a reason to discontinue statin therapy in older adults. However, despite the evidence highlighted in this review showing that older patients can safely achieve substantial benefit from statin therapy, studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between age and treatment propensity. Older patients often have multiple risk factors and many chronic comorbid conditions that appear to complicate and hinder treatment in many busy clinical practices. Broader guidelines for the use of statin therapy in older patients, incorporating recommendations for treatment goals and developing a framework for the use of statins in stroke prevention, would assist care providers in managing this high-risk population. Finally, both NPs and PAs are well educated and well placed to manage patients with stable chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Implementing a multidisciplinary team approach to identify people at risk and provide them with education, counseling, and effective statin therapy will help reduce the increased risk of CVD-associated morbidity and mortality in older adults.",0,0,
1435,Prevention of depression in adolescents at risk: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Adolescent children of depressed parents are at a markedly increased risk of developing depressive disorders. Although some smaller targeted prevention trials have found that depression risk can be reduced, these results have yet to be replicated and extended to large-scale at-risk populations in different settings. Objective To determine the effects of a group cognitive behavioral (CB) prevention program compared to usual care in preventing the onset of depression. Design, Setting, and Participants A multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in 4 US cities that enrolled 316 adolescent children (ages 13 to 17 years) of parents with current or prior depressive disorders from August 2003 to February 2006. Adolescents had a history of depression, elevated but underdiagnosed current depressive symptoms, or both. Assessments were performed at baseline, after the 8-week intervention, and after the 6-month continuation phase. Intervention Adolescents were randomly assigned to the CB prevention program consisting of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions followed by 6 monthly follow-up sessions or assigned to receive usual care only. Main outcome measure Rate and hazard ratio (HR) of a probable or definite depressive episode (ie depressive symptom rating score of 4) for at least 2 weeks as diagnosed by clinical interviewers. Results Through the post-continuation follow-up session, the rate and HR of incident depressive episodes were lower for those in the CB prevention program than for those in usual care (21.4% vs. 32.7%""; HR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.98). Adolescents in the CB prevention program also showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms than those in usual care (ratio, ?1.1; z = ?2.2; P = .03).Parents' current depression in moderate intervention effects at baseline (HR, 5.98; 95% CI %, 2.29-15.58; P = .001) Among adolescents whose parents were not depressed at baseline, the CB prevention program was more effective in preventing the onset of depression than usual care (11, 7% vs 40.5%; HR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.50), while for adolescents with a currently parent depressed, the CB prevention program was no more effective than usual care in preventing incidents of depression (31.2% vs 24.3%; HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.76-2.67). Conclusion The CB prevention program had a significant preventive effect during the 9-month follow-up period based on both clinical and clinical diagnoses. self-reported depressive symptoms, but this effect was not apparent for adolescents with a currently depressed parent.",0,0,
1436,Prevention of Falls in Older Adults Living in the Community: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.,"DESCRIPTION: Update to the 1996 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Statement of Recommendations on Counseling to Prevent Home and Recreational Injuries, Including Falls. METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care-relevant interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults. Interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactorial clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home risk modification, and exercise or physical therapy. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in adults 65 years of age or older who live in the community and who are at increased risk of falls. (Grade B Recommendation) The USPSTF does not recommend automatically performing a thorough multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older because the probability of benefit is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and physicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on the circumstances of prior falls, comorbid medical conditions, and patient values.

1437,Recommended Preventive Care (PCA)/Recommended Operative Care (OCA): Caries Categorization by Treatment Option,"Currently, clinicians, epidemiologists, and clinical research workers use a variety of systems and classifications to subdivide carious lesions into different grades. These systems are based on the depth of the lesion and/or the presence/absence of macroscopic cavitation. In order to improve the meaning and comparability of such systems in light of increased knowledge about the disease process, lesion behavior, and caries treatment options, the authors propose a new categorization system that difference between injuries that normally require surgical intervention and those that do not. In the future, it is proposed that, in addition to existing conventional criteria, diagnostic systems should also allow results to be expressed in terms of 1) lesions for which appropriate non-invasive preventive care is recommended (PCA lesions) and 2) lesions for which surgical intervention is required. Care is advised (OCA lesions). Locally acceptable subdivisions may need to be developed and agreed upon for specific applications. The adoption of this nomenclature and additional focus in the future should help communication between the different groups involved in caries diagnosis and research. It can facilitate the dissemination of research results, as well as help ""push"" researchers working on caries diagnostic methods to focus on techniques that will aid in the accurate assessment of lesion activity and behavior. Such an approach should also increase our understanding of treatment decision making and promote the development of clinical guidelines. The possibility of keeping existing criteria in parallel, for local and other purposes, would preserve comparability with previously collected data.",0,0,
1438,Preventive evidence in practice (PEP) study: implementation of guidelines to prevent primary vascular disease in the general practice protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There are significant gaps in the implementation and uptake of evidence-based guideline recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in Australian general practice. This study protocol describes the methodology for a cluster randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of a model that aims to improve the implementation of these guidelines in Australian general practice developed by a collaboration between researchers, non-governmental organizations and the profession. METHODS: We hypothesize that the intervention will alter the behavior of physicians and patients, resulting in improvements in recording of lifestyle and physiological risk factors (by 20%) and greater adherence to guidelines. guideline recommendations for: managing CVD and diabetes risk factors (by 20%). %)""; and lifestyle and physiological risk factors of patients at risk (by 5%). Thirty-two general practices will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to receive the intervention or continue with usual care, after stratification by state. The intervention will be delivered through: education in small groups; auditing of patient records to determine preventive care;"" and internship facilitation visits adapted to the needs of the internship. Outcome data will be extracted from electronic medical records and patient questionnaires, and qualitative assessment from interviews with providers and patients. DISCUSSION: We plan to disseminate the study findings widely and directly inform implementation strategies by governments, professional bodies, and non-governmental organizations, including partner organizations.",0,0,
1439,Preventive interventions for postpartum psychosis,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum psychosis is a life-threatening condition worldwide, affecting one to two in 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of delivery. Affected new mothers rapidly develop frank psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganized behaviors. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include first-time mothers who are single, women who are older or have a psychiatric history, and a family history of affective psychosis, antenatal depression, and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postpartum psychosis aim to identify women with risk factors, early recognition of impending psychosis through screening, and preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilizers, antipsychotic drugs, and hormone therapy may be beneficial in preventing postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the best available evidence for interventions to prevent postnatal psychosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group search strategy. . SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant randomized controlled trials for the prevention of postnatal psychosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection. If relevant trials were included, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two reviewers would have independently extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and number needed to treat for benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) by intention to treat. MAIN RESULTS: There are no studies included in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, including two old planned trials that appear never to have started, and one from which a study was excluded because it was a case series report. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This is not an empty review, it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite the growing interest in women's mental health, the literature in the area of postpartum psychosis is still very limited. It appears that physicians have no choice but to continue their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgment. Women at risk for postpartum psychosis and their families are justified in being disappointed in the medical/research fraternity. A post hoc search of PubMed (not specific to methodology) identified mainly case series. Policymakers have no trial-based evidence on which to base their guidelines. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomized studies. Available literature suggests that such studies are possible and research funders may wish to make this work a priority.",0,0,
1440,Adherence of Primary Care Physicians to Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Management Guidelines: Study Results of the Effectiveness of a Collaborative Pain Approach,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated guideline-concordant care provided by the primary care physician as documented in patients' medical records, predictors of documented guideline-concordant care, and its association with pain-related functioning. The patients were participants in a randomized trial of collaborative care for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The intervention included patient and primary care physician education, symptom monitoring, and feedback to physicians by the intervention team. METHODS: To assess concordance with the evidence-based treatment guidelines on which our intervention was based, we developed an 8-item chart review tool, the Pain Process Checklist (PPC). We then reviewed the electronic medical records of 365 veteran patients treated by 42 primary care physicians over 12 months. Intervention status, demographic and clinical variables were tested as predictors of PPC scores using generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE was also used to test whether PPC scores predicted treatment response (>/= 30% decrease in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score). RESULTS: Rates of documented guideline-concordant care varied widely across PPC items, from 94% of patients with addressed pain to 17% of opioid patients who addressed side effects. Intervention status was not related to item scores, and PPC-7 totals did not differ significantly between intervention and treatment-as-usual patients (61.2%, standard error [SE] = 3.3% vs. 55.2%, SE = 2.6%, P = 0.15). In a multivariate model, higher PPC-7 scores were associated with receiving an opioid prescription (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, P = 0.007) and lower PPC-7 scores with patient age ( 10-year difference OR = 0.97, P = 0.004). Finally, intervention patients who received quantitative assessments of pain and depression were less likely to respond to treatment (assessed vs. not assessed: 18% vs. 33%, P = 0.008 and 13% vs. 28%, P = 0.001 , respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As measured by review of medical records, additional training and physician feedback did not increase the provision of documented guideline-consistent pain care, and guideline adherence by primary care physicians did not. improved clinical outcomes for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.",0,0,
1441,Experiences of primary care physicians prescribing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis at a specialized community health center in Boston: lessons from early adopters,"INTRODUCTION: An estimated 1.2 million Americans have indications to use antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV acquisition. For many of these people at risk, the best opportunity to learn about and receive PrEP will be during routine visits to their primary care general practitioners. However, few general practitioners have prescribed PrEP, mainly due to practical concerns about PrEP delivery in primary care settings. The experiences of specialist primary care physicians who have prescribed PrEP may inform the feasibility of PrEP provision by general practitioners. METHODS: During January to February 2015, 35 primary care physicians at a community health center in Boston specializing in the care of sexual and gender minorities completed anonymous surveys about their experiences and practices with PrEP provision. The responses were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two physicians (response rate=91%) completed the surveys. Nearly all physicians (97%) had prescribed PrEP (median 20 patients, interquartile range 11-33). Most physicians reported testing and counseling practices for risk reduction consistent with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for PrEP. Physicians indicated that patients using PrEP experienced drug toxicities infrequently and generally reported high adherence. However, some clinicians' practices differed from guideline recommendations, and some clinicians observed patients with higher-risk behaviors. Most clinicians (79%) rated PrEP provision as easy to achieve, and 97% felt likely to prescribe PrEP in the future. CONCLUSIONS: In an experienced primary care clinic specializing in HIV prevention, clinicians perceived provision of PrEP to large numbers of patients to be safe, feasible, and potentially effective. Efforts to engage primary care general practitioners in PrEP provision could facilitate scaling up this effective intervention.",0,0,
1442,Primary care consultation practice guidelines: the effectiveness of computerized versus paper-based versions. A cluster randomized controlled trial among newly qualified primary care physicians.,"Objective: To compare the effects of the computerized and paper versions of the guidelines on the consulting practices of newly qualified physicians. Methods: Two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive computerized or textbook-based versions of the same guidelines over a 4-week study period. Physician adherence to guideline recommendations for laboratory, radiological, physical, and other examinations, procedures, nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments, physical therapy, and referrals was measured by review of case notes. Results: A total of 139 newly qualified physicians working in 96 primary health care centers in Finland participated in the study. Data from 4,633 patient encounters were abstracted, of which 3,484 were suitable for further analysis. Physician adherence to guidelines was high (over 80% for laboratory use, radiology, physical exams, and referrals). There were no significant differences in physician consultation practices for any of the outcomes measured between the computerized and textbook groups. Conclusion: The guidelines are a useful source of information for newly qualified physicians working in primary care. However, the method of presentation of the guidelines (electronic or paper) has no effect on the use of the guidelines or their impact on decisions. When choosing the guideline presentation method, other factors should be considered, such as information search time, ease of use during consultation, updateability, production costs, and clinician preferences.",1,1,
1443,Response of primary care physicians to the dissemination of practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Much effort has been put into producing clinical practice guidelines, but relatively few studies address dissemination issues. Unless guidelines are used, little is gained. This study assesses the effect of three methods of disseminating asthma guidelines on physician behavior and attitudes toward educational strategies. METHODS: Asthma guidelines were mailed to 60 physicians at three Area Health Education Centers in Arkansas. Outreach efforts on one site included a brief summary, phone calls from ""retail"" physicians, and a continuing medical education conference. The second site used computer strategies and the third site used a multimedia approach with fax messages, posters, videotapes, audiotapes, and a continuing medical education conference. A fourth site with 22 participants served as a comparison. Data were collected through mailed questionnaires, reviews of outpatient medical records, and interviews with physicians. Changes between baseline and post-test assessments after a 4-month intervention for medication use were calculated, and use of peak flow monitoring was compared with the control group (general linear model). Regression analyzes were used to identify medical and practice factors associated with particular educational techniques. RESULTS: Each site improved in medication use or peak flow monitoring, but none improved in all areas. The continuous reminder multimedia approach was well accepted, but there was little support for the computer strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts to disseminate clinical guidelines should include a variety of formats with an emphasis on short, concise summaries and frequent reminders. Social influence appears to play a role and will be a fruitful area for future research.",0,1,
1444,Use of lumbar spine imaging by primary care physicians: effects of guidelines and practice pattern feedback,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce variability in the use of procedures by primary care physicians to image the lumbar spine. DESIGN: Controlled intervention using clinical practice guideline and practice pattern feedback. STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty-seven internists and 28 family physicians in a large group model HMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Physicians in the intervention group received the clinical practice guideline for low back pain, followed after 4 months by three bimonthly feedback reports on their current rates of use of lumbar spine radiography and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. MRI of the lumbar spine. . Physicians in the control group received neither the guide nor the feedback reports. Automated radiology utilization data were used to compare changes in utilization rates and variability in utilization rates for clinicians in the intervention and control groups over the course of the study period. Neither regimen alone nor regimen plus feedback was associated with a significant decrease in rates of use or variability in rates of use of the study lumbar spine imaging procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice guidelines and practice pattern feedback fail to achieve their goals when characteristics of the practice environment and patient expectations and behavior are not identified and addressed.",0,0,
1445,Primary care provider attitudes are associated with smoking cessation counseling and referral,"OBJECTIVE: Most primary care providers (PCPs) support the importance of quitting smoking, but counseling rates are low. We assessed the consistency of PCP attitudes toward smoking cessation counseling and corresponding cessation behaviors. DESIGN: This was a post-intervention analysis of a population-based sample from a cluster randomized controlled trial to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines. SETTING: A total of 18 VA sites in the southwestern and western United States participated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 PCPs completed a survey 12 months after implementation of a quality improvement (QI) program for smoking cessation. Their patients also completed 12 (n = 1080) and 18 month (n = 924) follow-up surveys. INTERVENTION: The quality improvement intervention included setting local priorities, developing, implementing, and monitoring the quality improvement plan. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCPs at intervention sites were more likely to advise patients on how to quit smoking (P = 0.04) but not to refer. PCP attitude toward smoking cessation counseling was strongly associated with informed counseling (P < 0.001) and with referral (P = 0.01). Other associations with counseling were the perceived barrier ""patients are not interested in quitting"" (P = 0.01) and fewer years in practice (P = 0.03)"";"" other associations with referral were specialty consultation (P < 0.0001) and the perceived barrier ""inconvenient referral"" (P = 0.001) (negative association). PCP attitudes were associated with higher rates of counseling, referral, and program attendance. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs, regardless of intervention participation, had attitudes consistent with their reported smoking cessation behaviors, and more favorable attitudes were associated with higher rates of patient-reported smoking cessation behavior. The findings suggest that PCPs who support cessation counseling and referral may provide more treatment recommendations and have higher rates of smoking cessation.",0,1,
1446,Smoking cessation interventions provided by primary care providers and smoking cessation among participants in the National Lung Screening Trial.,"SIGNIFICANCE: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) found a reduction in lung cancer mortality among participants screened with low-dose computed tomography compared with chest radiography. In February 2015, Medicare announced its decision to cover annual pulmonary screening for patients with a significant history of smoking. These guidelines promote smoking cessation therapy as an adjunct to screening, but the frequency and effectiveness of clinician-provided smoking cessation interventions after lung screening is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the reported clinician-provided 5 A's (ask, counsel, assess, assist [discuss smoking cessation or recommend smoking cessation medications or recommend counselling] and arrange follow-up) after lung screening and changes in smoking behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A matched case-control study (cases were quitters and controls were continuing smokers) of 3336 NLST participants who were current smokers at enrollment examined rates and patterns of participants' 5A administration after lung screening and reported smoking cessation behaviors. . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of physician-provided 5As and associated smoking cessation after pulmonary screening. RESULTS: Delivery of the 5A 1 year after screening was as follows: ask, 77.2%; advise, 75.6%; evaluate, 63.4%; help, 56.4%; and organizing follow-up, 10.4%. and assess was not significantly associated with smoking cessation in multivariate models that were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, screening results, nicotine dependence, and motivation to quit. 95% CI, 1.21-1.63), and organizing was associated with a 46% increased odds of quitting (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.19-1.79) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Attending and arranging follow-up by primary care providers for smokers participating in the NLST were associated with increased smoking cessation; ""less intensive interventions (ask, counsel, and assess) did not were.However, rates of attendance and organization of follow-up were relatively low.Our findings confirm the need and benefit of clinicians taking more active interventional measures to help screened patients quit of smoking.",0,0,
1447,Responsiveness of Primary Care Providers to Health Risk Behaviors Reported by Adolescent Patients,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the responsiveness of physicians to health risk behaviors reported by adolescent patients during a comprehensive clinical preventive services visit. DESIGN: Nonprobabilistic sample of adolescent patients scheduled for a routine physical examination. SETTING: Seven clinical centers in the Chicago, Ill. area. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen primary care providers and 95 adolescent patients between the ages of 11 and 18. INTERVENTION: Providers delivered comprehensive clinical preventive services to adolescent patients using the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services model. This model includes screening, counseling, a physical exam, and immunizations. Prior to the visit, adolescent patients completed a screening questionnaire that included a 52-item health risk behavior profile. The answers to the selection questionnaire were discussed during the visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each provider's responsiveness to reported health risk behaviors was determined by comparing the adolescent patient's responses on the screening questionnaire with those reported during a debriefing interview with the adolescent about whether specific topics were discussed . Responsiveness to highly sensitive behaviors was determined by comparing the screening questionnaire and medical history. RESULTS: On average, each adolescent patient reported 10 risk behaviors, of which 7 were discussed. Severity of reported risk behavior, number of reported biological health problems, and gender of the adolescent patient were significant predictors of provider responsiveness. The number of reported health risk behaviors, length of visit, professional role and gender of the provider, whether the adolescent was a new patient, and the age of the adolescent patient were not related to responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Providers addressed most reported health risk behaviors during a single visit, but responsiveness decreased when 3 or more biological health problems or relatively serious problems were reported. Steps can be taken to increase the responsiveness of providers.",0,0,

1449,Primary care-based multifaceted interdisciplinary medical educational intervention for patients with systolic heart failure: lessons learned from a cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic (systolic) heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling condition. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines in primary care has been shown to improve health outcomes. The aim was to explore the impact of a multidisciplinary educational intervention for general practitioners (GPs) (Train the Trainers = TTT) on patient and performance outcomes. METHODS: This paper presents the key findings of the trial and discusses the lessons learned during the implementation of the TTT trial. Primary care practices were randomized to the TTT intervention or control group. Thirty-seven GPs (18 TTT, 19 control) were randomized and 168 patients diagnosed with proven congestive heart failure (91 TTT, 77 control) were enrolled. GPs in the intervention group attended four meetings that addressed clinical practice guidelines and pharmacotherapy feedback. The primary outcome was patient self-reported quality of life at seven months, using the SF-36 physical functioning scale. Secondary outcomes included other SF-36 scales, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), total mortality, hospital admissions for heart failure, prescription, depressive disorders (PHQ-9), behavior change (European Self-Care Behavior Scale of heart failure), patient-perceived quality of care (EUROPEP), and improvement of heart failure using NT-proBNP levels. Because recruitment targets were not achieved, an exploratory analysis was performed. RESULTS: There was high initial achievement in both groups for many outcomes. At seven months, there was no significant mean difference between groups for the primary outcome measure (-3.3, 95% CI -9.7 to 3.1, p = 0.30). The only difference in secondary outcomes was related to the prescription of aldosterone antagonists by physicians in the intervention group, with significant differences between groups at follow-up (42% vs. 24%, adjusted OR = 4.0 , 95% CI 1.2-13"";"" p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The intervention did not change the primary outcome or most of the secondary outcomes. Recruitment targets were not achieved and insufficient recruitment of practices and patients coupled with selection bias of participating physicians preclude definitive conclusions, but the CI indicates a lack of intervention effectiveness in this sample. We describe the lessons learned from conducting the trial for future planning and conducting confirmatory trials in primary care. TEST REGISTRATION: ISRCTN08601529.",0,0,
1450,Interventions for smoking in primary care,"The primary care setting is an important place to promote smoking cessation. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing the effect of brief smoking interventions and comprehensive programs delivered in a primary care setting present excellent evidence that such interventions significantly increase patients' smoking cessation rates and that, as the dose of the intervention increases, the effect increases. Unfortunately, despite widespread dissemination of preventive service guidelines and positive physician attitudes toward such services, the current level of physician smoking cessation intervention in real-world settings is not high, which makes this an important research and public health issue. Interventions to increase the rate of implementation of provider-delivered brief tobacco dependence interventions can be broadly grouped into: provider education; clinical systems and procedures (eg, patient screening and follow-up);"" and organizational policy (eg, reimbursement, coverage, performance measures). Given the significant effect that primary care-based interventions can have on the smoking cessation, it is important to investigate methods to increase its delivery rate and effect Examples of research to motivate intervention questions include: what are the best incentives or combination of incentives for clinicians? to remind providers to intervene? How can each of these be best implemented in different types of settings and systems? How can a matched model of stepped care and patient treatment be used? Studying factors such as reimbursement policies and covered benefits does not lend itself well to strictly controlled randomized trials. necessitates the use of quasi-experimental designs and the application of qualitative strategies. These designs represent a different challenge for the research community.",0,0,
1451,Primary Coronary Intervention (PCI) within the myocardial infarction network system in a German city (Essen),"In a German city (Essen, 490,000 inhabitants), a new network system for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was established in 2004. This included the so-called integrated care model (model IV) with the participation of insurance companies. In a cooperative structure between invasive and non-invasive hospitals, general practitioners and cardiologists, as well as emergency systems, all STEMI patients could be treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as possible according to current guidelines . Patient characteristics (age, sex, comorbidity, medication) were comparable to other trials and registries. The primary success rate was high (96.4%). Acute hospital outcomes demonstrated low mortality (7.6%). The delay time periods were comparable to other records. The symptom-balloon time was 239 min, medical contact-balloon 95 min, door-balloon 60 min, and puncture-balloon 18 min (median values). The STEMI network system in Essen demonstrates the possibility of modern therapy in patients with myocardial infarction (primary PCI) in a cooperative modality between all participants in the health care system.",0,0,
1452,Primary prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases through a cognitive behavioral program aimed at lifestyle changes in people at risk: Design of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The number of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is growing rapidly. To a large extent, this increase is due to lifestyle risk factors such as being overweight, reduced physical activity and an unhealthy diet. Changing these risk factors has the potential to postpone or prevent the development of T2DM and CVD. It is hypothesized that a cognitive behavioral program (CBP), focused in particular on motivation and self-control in people at high risk of CVD and/or T2DM, will improve their lifestyle behavior and, as a result, reduce their risk. . of developing DM2 and CVD. METHODS: 12,000 inhabitants, aged 30 to 50 years living in various municipalities in the semi-rural region of West-Friesland, will receive an invitation from their general practitioner (n = 13) to measure their own waist circumference with a tape measure. Persons with abdominal obesity (male waist >/= 102 cm, female waist > or= 88 cm) will be invited to participate in the second step of screening that includes blood pressure, a blood sample, and anthropometric measurements. DM2 and CVD risk scores will be calculated according to the ARIC and SCORE formulas, respectively. People with a score indicating a high risk of developing DM2 and/or CVD will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 300) or the control group (n = 300). Participants in the intervention group will follow a PFC aimed at modifying their eating behavior, physical activity and smoking behavior. The counseling methods to be used are motivational interviewing (MI) and problem-solving treatment (PST), which focus in particular on participants' intrinsic motivation to change and self-management of problems. CBP will be provided by nurse practitioners trained in the participant's general practice, and will consist of a maximum of six 30-minute individual sessions, followed by 3-month booster sessions over the phone. Control group participants will receive brochures containing health guidelines on physical activity and diet, and how to quit smoking. The primary outcome measures will be changes in T2DM and CVD risk scores. Secondary outcome measures will be changes in lifestyle behavior and cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. All relevant direct and indirect costs will be measured and followed up for 24 months. DISCUSSION: Changing behaviors is difficult, it requires time, considerable effort and motivation. The combination of the two counseling methods MI and PST, followed by booster sessions, can result in sustained behavior change. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN59358434.",0,0,
1453,Hand Hygiene Compliance Preparation in Clinical Settings,"Introduction: Effective hand hygiene is the most important procedure to prevent hospital-acquired infections. Traditional information/education based interventions have shown only modest benefits in adherence. This study set out to investigate whether grooming through olfactory and visual cues influences hand hygiene compliance. Method: Randomized controlled trial conducted in a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) at a teaching hospital in Miami, Florida. Primary outcome data included observations: a mix of health professionals and service users admitted to the SICU was observed by 2 trained observers and independently verified for their hand hygiene compliance. Interventions included either an olfactory priming (clean, citrus smell) or a visual priming (male or female eyes). The primary outcome measure was hand hygiene compliance (HHC) measured by the visitor using the hand sanitizer dispenser. Results: At the 5% level, there was significant evidence that a clean citrus odor significantly improves HHC (46.9% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.0001). Compared to the control group, a significant improvement in HHC was observed when an image of ""male eyes"" was placed on the hand gel dispenser (33.3% vs. 15.0%, p < 0.038). No significant improvement in HHC was seen when an image of female eyes was placed on the same hand gel dispenser (10.0% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.626). Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to show that priming can influence HHC in a clinical setting. The findings suggest that preparedness interventions could be used to change other behaviors relevant to public health. (PsycINFO Database Registry (c) 2016 APA, All Rights Reserved)",1,1,
1454,Printed educational materials: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Printed educational materials (PEMs) are widely used passive dissemination strategies to improve knowledge, awareness, attitudes, skills, professional practice, and patient outcomes. They are traditionally presented in print formats, such as monographs, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and clinical guidelines, and seem to be the most frequently adopted method of disseminating information. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of MEPs in improving process outcomes (including health professional behavior) and patient outcomes. Explore whether the effect of PEM characteristics (eg, source, content, format, mode of delivery, time/frequency, complexity of target behavior change) can influence process outcomes (including behavior of health professionals and patient outcomes). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched up to July 2006: (a) COPD Group Specialized Register (including the database of studies awaiting assessment (see 'Specialized Register' in 'Group Details'). ')""; (b) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Efficacy Review Abstracts Database""; (c) MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CAB Health. An updated MEDLINE search was performed on March 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) analyzes that evaluated the impact of educational materials were included. printed in the practice of health professionals and/or patient outcomes There was no language restriction Any objective measure of professional performance (e.g., number of tests requested, prescrip tions for a particular drug) or patient health outcomes (eg. g., blood pressure, number of caesarean sections) that we re-included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four reviewers independently performed data extraction using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion between the reviewers and referees. Statistical analysis was based on consideration of dichotomous process outcomes, continuous process outcomes, dichotomous patient outcome measures, and continuous patient outcome measures. The results of all comparisons were presented using a standard method of presentation where possible. The median effect size for each type of outcome and the median of these effect sizes across studies were reported separately for each study. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included for this review. The evidence in this review showed that MEPs appear to have small beneficial effects in professional practice. RCTs comparing MEPs with no intervention found a median absolute risk difference: +4.3% in categorical process outcomes (eg, X-ray requests, prescribing, and smoking cessation activities) (range -8 .0% to +9.6%, 6 studies), and a +13.6% relative risk difference in continuous process outcomes (eg, medication change, X-ray requests per practice) (range - 5.0% to +26.6%, 4 studies). These findings are similar to those reported for the ITS studies, although significantly larger effect sizes were observed (relative risk difference ranges from 0.07% to 31%). In contrast, the median effect size was -4.3% for categorical patient outcome measures (eg, screening, return to work, smoking cessation) (range -0.4% to - 4.6%, 3 studies)). Two studies reported deteriorations in continuous patient outcome data (eg, depression score, smoking cessation attempts) of -10.0% and -20.5%. A study comparing PEMs with educational workshops found minimal differences. Two studies comparing PEMs and educational outreach had no statistically significant differences between groups. It was not possible to explore potential effect modifiers across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review suggest that, compared to no intervention, PEMs when used alone may have a beneficial effect on process outcomes, but not on patient outcomes. Despite this wide range of reported effects for PEMs, the clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is unknown. There is not enough information on how to optimize educational materials. The effectiveness of educational materials compared to other interventions is uncertain.",0,1,
1455,Printed educational messages fail to increase the use of thiazides as first-line medication for hypertension in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial [ISRCTN72772651,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of print educational messages in helping to increase evidence-based clinical practice is conflicting. Nonetheless, these messages are flooding doctors' offices, in an attempt to promote treatments that can reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. This study evaluated the ability of print educational messages to promote the choice of thiazides as first-line treatment for people newly diagnosed with hypertension, a practice supported by good evidence and included in guidelines, and which could reduce costs for the health care system. . METHODS: The study uses a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (randomized by medical practice group). SCENARIO: The scenario involves all general practitioners/family practitioners in Ontario. Messages advising the use of thiazides as first-line treatment of hypertension were mailed to each physician along with a widely read professional bulletin. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive different versions of printed educational messages: an ""insert"" (two-page evidence-based article) and/or one of two different versions of an ""outsert"" (brief, directive message stapled to the outside of the newsletter). ). One outsert was developed with no explicit theory and one with developed messages targeting planned behavior theory factors or none at all (newsletter only, no mention of thiazides). Percentage of patients older than 65 years and newly diagnosed with hypertension who were prescribed a thiazide as the only initial prescription drug. The intervention effect was estimated using a logistic regression model estimated using generalized estimating equation methods to account for patient grouping within medical practices. RESULTS: Four thousand five hundred four physicians (with 23,508 patients) were randomized, providing 97% power to detect a 5% absolute increase in thiazide prescribing. No effect of the intervention was detected. Thiazides were prescribed to 27.6% of patients who consulted control physicians, 27.4% to insertion physicians, 26.8% to outpatient physicians, and 28.3% of patients who consulted insertion + external physicians, p = 0.54. CONCLUSIONS: The study failed conclusively to demonstrate any impact of print educational messages on increased prescription of thiazide diuretics for first-line treatment of hypertension.

Mental health and psychiatric nursing practices have circumnavigated the development of a standard Medical-Ethical Uniform for PRN Psychotropic Medication Administration This document examines the evidence for PRN psychotropic medication administration and, in the context of evidence-based best practices, current mental health policy, and professional ethics, proposes a standardized Australian PRN administration protocol PRN medications are divided into five simple steps, namely (i) medical prescription, (ii) nursing assessment of the patient's indications for an intervention, (iii) nursing consideration of the therapeutic options; (iv) obtaining informed consent from the patient;"" and (v) documentation of the results of the PRN administration. The literature associated with each step is reviewed, along with national and international professional ethics, guidelines, and patient rights documents related to the care of mental health patients. Recommendations for best practice of care are discussed for each step. There is a gap in published evidence supporting the use of PRN medications in hospitalized psychiatric patients. However, there is published evidence that PRN medications are associated with increased risks of morbidity, inappropriate use, may result in higher-than-recommended doses or polypharmacy, and complicate evaluation of the efficacy of regularly scheduled medications. Alternative non-pharmacological treatment options to PRN medication are effective and associated with fewer side effects. There are no explicit national standards, operational criteria, or quality assurance for the use of PRN medications in inpatient psychiatric units. Contemporary PRN practices are largely unregulated and driven essentially by anecdotal evidence, leaving clinicians and the service open to claims of little liability and (intentional and unintentional) misuse of psychotropic medications. The development of best practice guidelines for the use of PRN administration is essential.",0,0,

Structured Asthma Care Intervention System (the 3+ visit plan), reminding participating families to see their GP. Main outcome measures Process measures: GP asthma consultation rates, written asthma plans, completion of 3+ visit plan; clinical measures: rates of asthma emergency department visits, days absent from school, symptom-free days, symptoms in the past year, activity limitation in the past year, and asthma medication use in the past year ; spirometric measures of lung function before and after cold air challenge. Results Children in the intervention group had significantly more asthma-related visits (odds ratio for three or more asthma-related visits). consultations 3.8 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 7.6; P = 0.0001), written asthma plans (2.2 (1.2 to 4.1); P = 0.01 ) and plans for more than 3 visits completed (24.2 (5.7 to 103.2); P = 0.0001) than control children and a mean reduction in measurements of forced expiratory volume in one second after cold air challenge 2.6% (1.7 to 3.5); P = 0.0001) less than control children.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of consensus guidelines agreed between physicians and specialists on physician behavior. SETTING: Southampton and South West Hampshire Health District, UK. SUBJECTS: 179 physicians working in 45 practices in the Southampton district of 254 eligible physicians, 107 in the control group and 78 in the study group. MAIN MEASURES: Referral and investigation rates and prescription costs for dyspepsia in the six months before and after guideline introduction. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines were produced relatively easily. After its introduction, referral rates for upper gastrointestinal symptoms fell significantly in both the study and control groups, but there were no significant changes in either group in the use of endoscopy or radiology, either in terms of referral rates, patient selection, or research findings. No difference was seen between the control and study groups in the number of items prescribed, but prescription costs increased by 25% (from £2,634 to £3,215 per GP) in the study group, almost at its entirely due to a higher prescription rate for ulcer-healing agents. CONCLUSION: The development of district guidelines for the management of dyspepsia by consensus between GPs and specialists was feasible. However, their uptake and adoption was variable, and their measured effects on some aspects of clinical behavior were relatively weak and not necessarily associated with reduced costs or better quality of care.",0,0,

People delay writing their research (we heard that!), repeatedly state they'll start their diets tomorrow, or put off doing odd jobs around the house until next week. However, people sometimes also try to control their procrastination by setting deadlines. In this article we ask three questions: (a) Are people willing to set significant (ie, expensive) deadlines for themselves to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When deadlines are self-imposed, do people set them optimally, to maximize performance? A set of studies examined these issues experimentally and showed that the answer is ""yes"" to the first two questions and ""no"" to the third. People have self-control issues, recognize them, and try to control them by setting costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.",0,0,
1467,Professional and lay social support for hysterectomy patients,"This article describes a study of social support for women undergoing hysterectomy and shows how the original research plans had to be modified when the first interviews revealed the women's need for and desire for basic information from the researcher. The modified design allowed for comparisons between a group of women who received information as part of the research interview and a second group who did not receive such help. Post-hysterectomy follow-up at 3 months showed significant differences between the 2 groups, with the 'information group' being less hostile but more critical of their hospital treatment. The study also confirms previous findings by the same author of generally high levels of satisfaction, health, and return to activity after hysterectomy. With regard to social support, it is suggested that full-time homemakers are especially in need of support from nurses due to their relative isolation from other sources of support and information. However, all the interviewees would have liked more information and support from health professionals. Despite the acknowledged limitations of the study, some guidelines are offered for nurses seeking to increase levels of lay and professional support for their patients.",0,0,
1468,Professional interventions for general practitioners in the management of musculoskeletal conditions,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal conditions require particular management skills. Identifying interventions that are effective in equipping general practitioners (GPs) with the necessary skills could translate into better health outcomes for patients and lower healthcare and social costs. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of professional interventions for GPs that aim to improve the management of musculoskeletal conditions in primary care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2010, Issue 2""; MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 - October 2013); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 - October 2013); CINAHL, EbscoHost ( 1980 - November 2013) ), and the COPD specialist register. We performed cited reference searches using ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, and manually searched selected issues of Arthritis and Rheumatism and Primary Care-Clinics in Office Practice. The last search was conducted in November 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of professional interventions for GPs, which were conducted in a community setting, with the aim of improving management (including diagnosis and treatment) of musculoskeletal conditions and reporting e of any objective measure of GP performance, financial or patient outcomes. Length, duration, intensity and complexity compared to active or inactive controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently abstracted all data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) of adherence to desired practice for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes. We investigated whether the direction of specific behavior change affects the effectiveness of interventions. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 11 studies on osteoporosis, meta-analysis of five studies (high-certainty evidence) showed that a combination of a GP alert system about a patient's increased risk of osteoporosis and a patient-directed intervention (including patient education and a reminder to see their GP) improves GP behavior regarding diagnostic bone mineral density (BMD) testing and prescription of osteoporosis medications (RR 4.44; ( 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.54 to 5.55, 3 studies, 3386 participants)) for BMD and RR 1.71 (95% CI 1.50 to 1.94, 5 studies, 4223 participants) for medication for osteoporosis. Meta-analysis of two studies showed that GP alert alone probably also improves GP behavior consistent with osteoporosis guidelines (RR 4.75 [95% CI 3.62 to 6.24; 3047 participants]) for BMD and RR 1.52 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.84, 3047 participants) for osteoporosis medication) and that adding the patient-directed component is unlikely to result in a higher effect (RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 2995 participants)) for BMD and RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.10; ""2995 participants) for osteoporosis medication.Of the 10 studies on low back pain, seven showed that guideline dissemination and educational opportunities for GPs may lead to little or no improvement in consistent GP behaviour. with guidelines.Two studies showed that the combination of guidelines and GP feedback wax on the total number of investigations requested may have an effect on the behavior of the GP and result in a slight reduction in the number of tests, while one of these studies showed that the combination of the guidelines and the GP r Reminders attached to radiology reports may result in a small but sustained reduction in the number of investigation requests. Of the four studies on osteoarthritis, one study showed that the use of influential physicians in education may result in improvement in GP behavior consistent with guidelines. Another study showed slight improvements in patient outcomes (pain control) after training GPs on pain management. Of three studies on shoulder pain, one study reported that there may be little or no improvement in patient outcomes (functional ability) after education of GPs about shoulder pain. and injection training. Of two studies on other musculoskeletal conditions, one study on pain management showed that there may be worse patient outcomes (pain control) after GP training on the use of validated assessment scales. The remaining 12 studies across all musculoskeletal conditions showed little or no improvement in GP behavior and patient outcomes. The direction of the target behavior (ie, increasing or decreasing a behavior) does not appear to affect the efficacy of an intervention. Most of the studies did not investigate the potential adverse effects of the interventions and only three studies included a cost-effectiveness analysis. Overall, there were important methodological limitations in the body of evidence, with only a third of studies reporting adequate allocation concealment. and blinded outcome assessments. While our confidence in the combined effect estimate of interventions to improve diagnostic testing and medication prescription in osteoporosis is high, our confidence in the effect estimates reported in the remaining studies is low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is good quality evidence that a GP alert system with or without targeted patient education on osteoporosis improves guideline-consistent GP behaviour, resulting in better diagnostic rates. and treatment. combined with guideline dissemination may lead to small improvements in guideline-consistent GP behavior with regard to low-back pain, while GP education on osteoarthritis pain and the use of influential physicians in education may lead to modest improvement in patient outcomes and guideline-consistent behavior, respectively. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of such interventions in improving GP behavior and patient outcomes.",0,1,
1469,Prognostic Research Strategy (PROGRESS) 1: A Framework for Researching Clinical Outcomes,"Understanding and improving the prognosis of a disease or health condition is a priority in research and clinical practice. In this article, the authors present a framework of four interrelated themes in prognostic research, describe the importance of the first of these themes (understanding future outcomes in relation to current diagnostic and treatment practices), and introduce recommendations for the field of prognosis. prognostic research. In clinical medicine, the term prognosis refers to the risk of future health outcomes in people with a given disease or health condition. Prognostic research is thus the investigation of relationships between future outcomes (endpoints) among people with a given baseline health state (baseline) to improve health (see Supplementary Figure at bmj.com). The study of prognosis has never been more important, as more people worldwide are living with one or more diseases or unhealthy conditions than at any time before.1 For this reason, governments around the world are increasing their interest in health care outcomes today. for people with disease.2 Similarly, research funders and investigators are increasingly focused on translating new interventions and technologies from the laboratory into clinical practice and then into health care policy to establish and implement new standards of care. high-quality care and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, the results of prognostic research should be an integral part of clinical decision making, health care policy, and the discovery and evaluation of new approaches to patient management. However, there is a worrying gap between the potential and actual impact of prognostic research on health. Too often, prognostic research studies fall far short of the high standards required in other fields, such as therapeutic trials and genetic epidemiology. In the PROGnosis RESearch Strategy (PROGRESS) series (www.progress-partnership.org), we propose a framework of four distinct but interrelated prognosis research topics:",0,0,
1470,Promising developments in neuropsychological approaches to screening for preclinical Alzheimer's disease: a selective review.,"Recently published guidelines suggest that the most opportune time to treat people with Alzheimer's disease is during the preclinical phase of the disease. This is a phase in which individuals are defined as clinically normal but show evidence of amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and subtle cognitive/behavioral impairment. While our standard cognitive tests are useful for detecting cognitive decline in the stage of mild cognitive impairment, they were not designed to detect the subtle cognitive variations associated with this stage of biomarkers of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. However, neuropsychologists are attempting to meet this challenge by designing new cognitive measures and questionnaires derived from translational efforts in neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical/experimental neuropsychology. This review is a selective overview of several novel and potentially promising approaches that are being explored to detect early cognitive evidence of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in presymptomatic individuals.",0,0,
1471,Promoting evidence-based psychosocial care for cancer patients,"With numerous studies showing that psychosocial care reduces distress and improves quality of life, clinicians have an obligation to treat cancer patients in a manner consistent with this evidence. Although the rationale is simple, there are major challenges to achieving the goal of translating research into clinical practice. One challenge has been the nature of the evidence, with many studies of psychosocial interventions characterized by poor methodological quality, an absence of eligibility criteria specifying increased distress, and minimal consideration of the potential for dissemination. A second challenge has been making practitioners aware of the relevant evidence. Dissemination efforts, such as the issuance of clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based recommendations and the distribution of intervention materials via the Internet, appear to be more effective than passive efforts in providing useful information to clinicians. Perhaps the most challenging aspect has been persuading practitioners to change the way they practice. An approach currently under development would allow clinicians and health care organizations to make self-assessments of the quality of their psychosocial care based on review of medical records. Comments showing that the quality of care is not optimal are likely to motivate change, especially if the quality indicators assessed are considered important and reliable and point to specific actions that can be taken. The use of evidence to promote changes in clinical practice represents one of the main ways in which the field of psycho-oncology can fully realize its potential to positively affect the lives of people with cancer.",0,0,
1472,Promotion of hand hygiene compliance,"BACKGROUND: The German ""Clean Hands Campaign"" (an adaptation of the WHO program ""Clean Care is Safer Care"") to promote hand hygiene among hospital staff at the Hannover Medical School (MHH, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover) , known as Aktion Saubere Hande (ASH), met with initial success. However, by 2013, rates of adherence to hygienic hand disinfection in the hospital's ten intensive care units (ICUs) and two hematopoietic stem cell transplant units (HSCTUs) had returned to baseline levels ( physicians: 48%;"" nurses: 56%). The PSYGIENE cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether interventions tailored in ways suggested by research in behavioral psychology could lead to more sustainable improvements than ASH METHODS: The ""Health Action Process Approach"" (HAPA) adherence model specifies the key psychological determinants of adherence.These determinants were assessed among MHH ICU and STU health workers by questionnaire (rates of response: physicians: 71%""; nurses: 63%) and through interviews with ward physicians and responsible nursing managers (100%). In 2013, 29 personalized behavior change techniques were implemented in educational training sessions and feedback discussions in the six rooms that made up the intervention arm of the trial, while ASH training sessions were provided in the control arm. trial results) were determined by non-participant observation of hygienic hand disinfection, according to the World Health Organization gold standard. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ in their baseline compliance rates in 2013 (intervention: 54%, control: 55%, p = 0.581). Personalized interventions led to higher adherence in each of the two years of follow-up (2014: 64%, p<0.001; ""2015: 70%, p=0.001), while adherence in the control arm increased at 68% in 2014 (p<0.001), but dropped again to 64% in 2015 (p=0.007).The increases in compliance between 2013 and 2015 and the rate of compliance in 2015 were greater in the intervention arm (p< 0.005).This was mainly due to the behavior of the nurses, as the corresponding parameters for the doctors did not differ significantly between the two study arms in the stratified analysis.CONCLUSION: Personalized interventions based on the principles of behavioral psychology led to to more sustainable increases in adherence to hand hygiene guidelines than ASH training sessions.This was true among nurses and thus also for hospital ward staff in their c set (i.e. nurses and doctors combined). Further studies are needed to identify more target group-specific interventions that may improve adherence among clinicians.",0,1,
1473,Promoting recovery in schizophrenic patients: discrepancy between usual practice and evidence. The SIEP-DIRECT Project,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to present the main discrepancies, evidenced by the SIEP-DIRECT'S Project, between the evidence-based NICE guidelines for schizophrenia and the usual practices of Italian mental health services to promote the recovery of patients. . with schizophrenia. METHODS: Based on the main NICE recommendations on promoting recovery, 41 indicators were developed. These were experienced in 19 participating Italian Mental Health Departments (MHD) or Psychiatric Services through self-assessment of the activities carried out to promote patient recovery with the aim of assessing the level of compliance with the recommendations. The data required by most of the indicators were obtained from the psychiatric information system or from the Directorate of the MHD. In addition, a specific investigation was carried out on medical records and on representative samples of patients. In addition, for 14 indicators, an evaluation by ""multidisciplinary"" or ""specialized"" focus groups was requested, which then assigned a score according to a defined ""ad hoc"" scale. RESULTS: According to the data obtained, although mental health services seem to care about the physical state of their patients, they do not routinely examine main parameters such as blood pressure, blood glucose, etc., and collaboration with general practitioners is usually complex or not. practiced uniformly. Most psychiatrists and psychologists have basic communication skills but not enough cognitive-behavioral treatment skills"";"" such treatments, and any other form of structured individual psychotherapy, are rarely carried out and seem to have become marginal activities within the Services. Family psychoeducational interventions are also underused. The Services are very active in the care of patients with multi-problematic schizophrenia, who constitute a large percentage (almost a quarter, on average) of the patients in their care. These patients are offered specific and integrated treatment plans with the involvement of other health services and social agents operating in the territory. The strategies adopted by the services for pharmacological treatment in the prevention of relapses and for patients with frequent crises or with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are all in line with the NICE recommendations. Finally, the Services promote vocational training and supported employment activities, but their results are often unsatisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show a picture of Italian mental health services with light but also dark areas regarding recovery promotion activities. The Services seem to guarantee appropriate pharmacological treatments based on evidence, integrated care and good management of multi-problematic patients. They have difficulty, however, with regard to monitoring the physical health of patients, psychotherapeutic activities, including for families, and promoting supported employment. In addition, they still show problems regarding the structuring and formalization of care processes. To improve this situation, they should make greater use of professional guidelines, protocols and written procedures.",0,0,
1474,Promotion of screening mammography in urban settings: a randomized controlled trial of computerized reminders as a component of a program to facilitate mammography,"In a one-year randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a computerized mammogram reminder system as a component of a program to increase the use of screening mammography at three health care organizations serving inner-city women in Detroit. , Michigan (two health department sites, one HMO site, and two private hospital sites). Four thousand four hundred one women over the age of 40 who had visited a study site in the previous year were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The limited intervention (LI) included education on breast cancer control by physician and staff, facilitated mammography appointment scheduling procedures, and eliminated the patient's out-of-pocket cost for mammography (in three of five sites). The full intervention (FI) included all the components of the limited intervention plus an additional set of 'cues to action'. These included a mammography reminder form inserted into the medical record of women due for mammography, intended to increase referral for mammography appointments, and reminders for patients intended to increase mammography completion among the women mentioned. During the one-year intervention period, 2725 randomized women visited a study site. 6-month mammography appointment rates among women with FI range from 38% to 65%, with the FI rate exceeding the LI rate at each site with differences of 13% (95% CI, 6 to 20) to 29% (21 to 38). The annual mammogram completion rate among women with FI ranges from 43% to 64% and exceeds the LI rate at each site by 12% (5 to 19) to 25% (16 to 34). After adjustment for age, the mammography intervention effect sizes among the five sites were not significantly different. The average increase in FI compared to LI was 18%. The computerized reminder system is effective in increasing the use of mammography at each of the study institutions, with the main effect being physician referral for mammography.",0,1,
1475,Promotion of self-care through adherence in patients with heart failure discharged from rural hospitals: a study protocol,"UNLABELED: Background Heart failure is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in adults, leading to prolonged morbidity, repeated hospitalizations, and placing an enormous financial burden on the health care system. Heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals, or primarily critical access hospitals, have higher rates of readmission and 30-day mortality compared with patients discharged from urban hospitals. Self-care improves health outcomes for heart failure patients and reduces readmissions, but adherence to self-care guidelines is low. We propose a home-based post-acute care service managed by advanced practice nurses to enhance patient activation and lead to improved self-care adherence in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals. Objective This article describes the study design and the research methods used to implement and evaluate the intervention. Method Our intervention is a 12-week patient activation (Patient AcTivated Care at Home [PATCH]) to improve adherence to self-care. Patients were randomized into two parallel groups (12-week PATCH intervention + usual care versus usual care only) to assess the efficacy of this intervention. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Discussion This study aimed to examine the efficacy of an activation-enhancing intervention led by advanced practice nurses and based on rural theory on adherence to self-management in patients with heart failure residing in rural areas. Our expectation is to facilitate adherence to self-care behaviors of patients with heart failure after discharge from rural hospitals and reduce complications and hospital readmissions, which will result in a reduction in the economic burden.

1476,Promoting the use of colorectal cancer screening tests,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is underused despite evidence that screening reduces mortality. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of an intervention directed at physicians and their patients on CRC detection rates. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial of community physicians and their patients. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four community primary care physicians randomly assigned to an intervention consisting of academic details and direct mailings to patients or a control group. Patients aged 50 to 79 years in the intervention group received a letter from their doctor, a brochure on CRC screening, and a pack of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards. MEASUREMENTS: After 1 year, we measure receipt of the following: (1) FOBT in the last 2 years, (2) flexible sigmoidoscopy (SIG) or colonoscopy (COL) in the previous 5 years, and (3) any CRC detection . We report the percent change from baseline in both groups. RESULTS: 9652 patients were enrolled over 2 years and 3732 patients over 5 years. There was no increase in any CRC screening that occurred in the intervention group for patients enrolled for 2 years (increase of 12.7% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.51). Similar results were seen for any CRC screening among patients enrolled over 5 years (increase of 9.7% vs. 8.6%, p=0.45). The only outcome where the intervention had an effect was on the rates of patients with detection GIS (increase of 7.4% vs 4.4%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: With the exception of an increase in SIG rates in the intervention group, the intervention had no effect on CRC detection rates. Future interventions should evaluate innovative approaches to increase CRC detection rates.",0,1,
1477,Promotion and prescription of hormone therapy after report of harm by the Women's Health Initiative,"Context Little is known about how the pharmaceutical industry responds to evidence of harm associated with its products, such as the July 2002 publication of the WomenÂ¡Â¯s Health Initiative Estrogen Plus Progestin Trial (WHI E+P) report showing that the standard-dose of Prempro produced significant harm and no net benefit. Objective To examine the pharmaceutical industry's response to the WHI E+P results by analyzing hormone therapy promotion expenditures before and after July 2002. Design and setting Nationally representative and prospectively collected longitudinal data (January 2001 to December 2003) on the prescription and promotion of hormonal therapies were obtained from IMS Health and Consumer Media Reports. Main outcome measures Trends in quarterly prescriptions for hormone therapy and expenditures in 5 modes of drug promotion: samples, office details, hospital promotion, magazine ads, and direct-to-consumer advertising. Results Prior to the WHI E+P report, prescription rates and promotional spending for hormone therapy were stable. In the quarter prior to the WHI E+P report (April-June 2002), 22.4 million hormone therapy prescriptions were dispensed and $71 million was spent on promotion (in annual terms, $350 per year per US physician). Within 9 months of the report's release (Q1 2003), there was a 32% decline in hormone therapy prescriptions, and a tipping point was reached for promotional spending (37% decline compared to E+P before WHI). levels). Spending decreased for all promotional activities and most hormone therapies. Overall, the largest declines were for displays (36% decline from the first quarter of 2003) and direct-to-consumer advertising (100% decline). The largest decreases in promotion occurred for the standard dose of Prempro (61% decrease from Q1 2003), the agent implicated in the WHI E+P report. More recently, promotional efforts have increased, particularly for Prempro at lower doses, a resurgence associated with a modest increase in prescriptions for this new agent. Conclusions Based on its widespread use, hormone therapy was among the most promoted medications prior to the WHI E+P report. After reporting evidence of harm from this trial, there was a substantial decline in promotional spending for hormone therapy, particularly for agents most directly involved in the trial. Interrelated with the impact of the trial results themselves and subsequent media coverage, reduced promotion may have contributed to a substantial decline in hormone therapy prescriptions.",0,0,
1478,Adequate antibiotic treatment. From penicillin to pharmacogenomics,"Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonderful discoveries of the 20th century. Flaming's use of penicillin ushered in the golden age of antibiotics and it is now hard to imagine practicing medicine without antibiotics. Life-threatening infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremic pneumonia sepsis would again prove fatal. Also aggressive chemotherapy and transplant procedures would be impossible. Another true wonder has been the rise in antibiotic resistance soon after the clinical use of penicillin in hospitals and communities. Several studies have shown an over-prescription of antibiotics for community patients and hospitalized patients and, in some hospitals, up to 50% of antibiotic use is inappropriate: the benefits of antibiotic treatment come with the risk of development of antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with higher mortality, morbidity, and prolonged hospital stay compared to infections caused by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria. A variety of strategies have been proposed to reduce the cost and improve the quality of medication use. Evidence-based education, guidelines, and recommendations are considered essential elements of any program designed to influence prescribing behavior and can provide a knowledge base that will improve and increase acceptance of management strategies. Evidence-based recommendations, an approach to clinical practice that helps make decisions based on clinical experience and intimate knowledge of individual patient situations, beliefs, and priorities, improve antimicrobial stewardship, including selection, appropriate dosage, route, and duration of antimicrobials. therapy can maximize clinical cure or prevention of infection while limiting unintended consequences such as emergence of resistance, adverse drug events, and cost. These evidence-based guidelines are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and clinical discretion is always required in their application. Genome studies have identified hundreds of genetic polymorphisms important determinants of therapy efficacy, and several trials have demonstrated the successful use of pharmacogenomic testing to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in patients. Knowing the phenotype of a patient prior to therapy, optimal doses and types of drugs can be prescribed to achieve better patient management.",0,0,
1479,Prophylaxis of infection after appendectomy: a review of current surgical practice.,"280 questionnaires were sent to junior surgical staff throughout England asking about the use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, topical antibacterial agents and surgical drainage in appendectomy. 175 (63%) responses were received from 81 of the 87 hospitals included in the survey. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics were used by 78 surgeons (46%) when operating on a normal appendix, but by 168 (99%) when the organ was perforated. Most surgeons started antibiotics preoperatively, but proportionately fewer did so when the appendix was gangrenous or perforated. Patients with severe contamination tended to receive longer courses of antibiotics, although the duration of administration varied considerably. Metronidazole was included in more than 95% of all prophylactic regimens and was often combined with other drugs when the appendix was gangrenous and perforated. Topical antibacterial agents were applied to the wound routinely by only 45 surgeons (26%), although 106 (61%) used them sometimes. Povidone-iodine was the most used agent. Only 98 surgeons (56%) ever drained appendectomy wounds, while 135 (77%) sometimes drained the peritoneal cavity. Evidence suggests that current methods of administering systemic antibiotic prophylaxis should continue, but that topical agents and surgical drainage may be unnecessary when surgeons are confident in the efficacy of the systemic treatment used.",0,0,

METHODS: A randomized pilot study of three systems with an independent randomized follow-up study of two of these was conducted in 186 patients receiving long-term therapy or who had recently started warfarin therapy and had been discharged from the hospital. RESULTS: All three computerized systems appeared to provide satisfactory control compared to the traditional dosing method. For patients who received more intensive treatment with an assigned target range of 3.0-4.5, computerized dosing schedules achieved significantly better control"";"" medical staff undertreated these patients nearly 50% of the time. CONCLUSION: Computer-based programs can help warfarin outpatient anticoagulant management during early and long-term treatment. For most patients, the control achieved is as good as that achieved by the usual method of dosing by experienced clinicians, although the latter tend to be overly conservative when dosing patients within the intense target range of 3 .0 to 4.5 International Normalized Ratio (INR) .

DESIGN Prospective study with completion of questionnaires before myocardial revascularization and three months, one year and five years later. SCOPE Regional cardiothoracic center. PATIENTS 100 male patients, all under 60 years of age at the time of the operation, who were patients of two cardiothoracic surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patients' assessment of their health status in terms of functional ability and aspects of distress, based on the Nottingham Health Profile and outcome of the operation in terms of changes in symptoms, work life and daily activities determined by self-completed study questionnaires before the operation and three and six months later. RESULTS Intermediate results at one year are reported. The differences between the Nottingham Health Profile scores preoperatively and three months postoperatively were significantly different (p less than 0.01), indicating appreciable improvement in general health status, and at one year compare favorably. with those of a normal male population. Analysis of the responses to the study questionnaire showed that 65 of 89 patients (73%) were working one year after the operation and another seven (8%) maintained that they were able to work but could not find employment. The proportion of patients complaining of chest pain was reduced from 90% (88/98) before grafting to 19% (17/89) one year after myocardial revascularization, when 91% (81/89) of patients patients maintained that their condition was good. either completely better or definitely improved. Significant positive factors affecting return to work and home activities were preoperative work, short wait for operation, absence of breathlessness, and low physical mobility score on the Nottingham Health Profile (all p less than 0.001).

1485,Prospective trial of real-time electronic surveillance to accelerate early care for severe sepsis.,"Purpose of Study An automated real-time electronic health record retrieval and caregiver notification system was developed and tested for its utility in improving sepsis care. We hypothesize that the algorithm will increase the speed and timeliness of blood lactate and blood culture sampling, chest radiography, and antibiotic provision. Methods A consecutively enrolled prospective before-and-after study examined an algorithm that automatically identified adult patients who met 2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and 2 or more blood pressure measurements less than or equal to 90 mm Hg during your stay in the emergency department (ED). In phase 1, the system collected information but did not alert caregivers. In phase 2, caregivers were notified via alphanumeric paging and text entry in the electronic medical record of patients' possible illness and provided with specific recommendations. Results The patients (33,460) were evaluated for 6 months; 398 patients activated the system, including 184 (46%) properly identified as severely septic. The algorithm had a positive predictive value of 54% and a negative predictive value of 99% in detecting severe infection with acute organ dysfunction. The median time for patients to accumulate SIRS and blood pressure criteria was 152 minutes (range interquartile [IQR] 71 to 284 minutes), underscoring the dynamic nature of critical illness diagnosis in the emergency setting and the need for screening algorithms to repeatedly screen patients during their evaluation. 2 interventions with greater frequency, chest x-ray before admission (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.5) and extraction of blood cultures (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.5). 7.7) Only blood culture tests performed significantly faster in the presence of decision support (mean culture time before intercalating). vention 86 minutes, IQR 31, 296 minutes; mean culture time after intervention 81 minutes, IQR 37, 245 minutes; p = 0.032 according to the Cox proportional hazards model).

In 2012, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued a regulation for antibiotic prescriptions limiting them to <20% of all outpatient prescriptions, but no operational details regarding policy implementation have been issued. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a multidimensional intervention designed to reduce antibiotic use among children (2 to 14 years of age) with acute upper respiratory tract infections in rural primary care settings in China, by changing physician prescribing behaviors and parent education. /caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, parallel-group, controlled, cluster-randomized, superiority trial with blinded outcome assessment and data analysis, and unblinded treatment. From two counties in Guangxi province, 12 municipal hospitals will be randomized to the intervention arm and 13 to the control arm. In the control arm, the management of antibiotic prescriptions will continue with usual care through clinical consultations. In the intervention arm, a provider- and patient/caregiver-focused intervention will be integrated into routine primary care practice. Provider intervention includes operational guidelines, systematic training, peer review of antibiotic prescribing, and health education for patient caregivers. We will also provide educational print materials and educational videos to patient caregivers. The primary outcome is the proportion of all prescriptions written by providers for upper respiratory tract infections in children aged 2-14 years that include at least one antibiotic.

1491,"Protocol for a systematic review of telephone psychosocial interventions on relapse prevention, adherence to psychiatric medication, and health risk behaviors in adults with a psychotic disorder","INTRODUCTION: The mental and physical health of people with a psychotic illness is usually poor. When adhered to, medication can reduce relapse. However, despite adherence, relapse remains common and functional outcomes often remain compromised. Compliance is also often low. Morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease are also high, along with several important modifiable health risk behaviors. Therefore, access to psychosocial interventions is important, but currently limited. Wiretaps represent a promising solution, although more clarity is needed. Accordingly, we aim to provide an overview and critical review of the current state of the evidence for telephone-delivered psychosocial interventions targeting key health priorities in adults with a psychotic disorder, including (1) relapse, (2) adherence to psychiatric medication and/or (3) modifiable cardiovascular health risk behaviors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our methods are based on published guidelines. The review is recorded and any modifications to the protocol will be tracked. Ten peer-reviewed electronic databases and four gray literature databases have been identified. Preliminary literature searches on telephone psychosocial interventions targeting relapse, medication adherence, and/or health risk behaviors in adults with a psychotic disorder were conducted.

1493,"Provider attitudes toward oral pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among high-risk men who have sex with men in Lima, Peru","Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was the first biomedical intervention to demonstrate efficacy in preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). Health care providers' attitudes toward PrEP will be critical in translating this finding into effective public health implementation programs. In a convenience sample of 186 health care providers in Peru, we assessed knowledge, barriers, and attitudes to prescribing and monitoring HIV PrEP for high-risk MSM and transgender women, the populations with the highest incidence of HIV in this environment. A total of 57.5% reported knowing about PrEP, and knowledge was independently associated with caring for more than 50 MSM (OR: 3.67, p<0.002). Lack of local guidelines, concerns about increasing high-risk behaviors, antiretroviral drug resistance, and limited availability of antiretrovirals for people living with HIV were the most common barriers to prescribing PrEP.

1494,Provider Details: An Intervention to Reduce Prescription Opioid Deaths in Utah,"BACKGROUND: Utah undertook a multipronged effort to reverse an epidemic of deaths among patients taking prescription opioids. This article describes the provider detailing part of the effort. METHODS: Presentations highlighting six recommended prescribing practices were developed and presented to health care workers. Participants were encouraged to use the state prescription database and to complete a series of surveys to assess confidence and behavior changes at 0, 1, and 6 months after presentation. Continuing medical education credits encouraged participation. FINDINGS: Drug-related overdose deaths in Utah fell 14.0% in 2008 compared to 2007 after program implementation. A total of 581 physicians and numerous non-physician health workers were reached during 46 presentations. Follow-up surveys on the degree of adoption of changes in practice were completed by 366 participants at 0 months, 82 participants at 1 month, and 29 participants at 6 months. The combined results of the three assessments showed that between 60% and 80% of responding providers reported that they no longer prescribe long-acting opioids for acute or sedative pain; 50% reported using the Utah Controlled Substances Database during patient care and using lower starting doses and slower escalations;"" and 30-50% reported obtaining EKGs and sleep studies on patients using patient education tools and implementing Utah prescribing guidelines.CONCLUSIONS: Provider details were associated with a decrease in Utah prescription opioid mortality rate and improvements in provider self-reported prescribing behaviors. Other concurrent interventions may have contributed to the decrease in mortality rates.The effect of this intervention was limited by short-term funding.",0,0,
1495,Provider education to promote implementation of clinical practice guidelines,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although the interest and promulgation of clinical practice guidelines have increased significantly in the last 2 decades, there is concern about their actual implementation. This article focuses on a strategy to encourage implementation of the guideline at the clinical level: clinical education. The objectives of the article are to review educational strategies, consider them within the context of complementary strategies carried out at the organizational and clinical level, and outline the challenges and recommendations for the continuing education of physicians. METHODS: Experience and data from relevant randomized clinical trials are reviewed within an educational setting. COMMENTS: Implementation of clinical practice guidelines requires a variety of skills, including assessment, proper delineation of a treatment and monitoring plan, patient follow-up, and patient counseling and education skills. Continuing education strategies should reflect the content and teaching methods that best suit the learning objectives. Current practice pressures place limits on the resources, particularly physician time, that are available for continuing education. Organizational resources must be committed to building the complementary support systems needed to improve clinical practice. In addition to clinicians, education should be directed at non-physician clinicians, office staff, and administrators who are also responsible for guideline implementation. CONCLUSIONS: To meet the challenges of building physician motivation, balancing competing demands, and treating patients with complex medical conditions, all within time constraints, clinical leaders must design educational activities that are supported by leadership. , reflect compelling evidence, use multiple teaching strategies and techniques. and engage students in skill development and problem solving.",0,0,
1496,Provision of social norms feedback to high prescribers of antibiotics in general practice: a pragmatic national randomized controlled trial.,"Background Unnecessary prescription of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance. In this trial, our aim was to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions by general practitioners (GPs) in England. Methods In this randomized, 2?Ã—?2 factorial trial, publicly available databases were used to identify GP practices whose antibiotic prescribing rate was in the top 20% for their NHS local area team. of Health (NHS). Eligible practices were randomized (1:1) into two groups using a computer-generated allocation sequence, stratified by NHS local area team. The participants, but not the investigators, were blinded to group assignment. On 29 September 2014, all GPs in the feedback intervention group were sent a letter from the chief medical officer for England and a leaflet on antibiotics to use with patients. The letter said the practice was prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80% of the practices in its NHS Local Area Team. Physicians in the control group received no communication. The sample was re-randomized into two groups, and in December 2014, GP practices were either sent patient-focused information promoting reduced antibiotic use or received no communication at all. The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotics dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for previous prescriptions. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered in the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN32349954, and has been completed. Findings Between September 8 and 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1,581 general practitioner practices to feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups. Letters were sent to 3227 physicians in the intervention group. Between October 2014 and March 2015, the rate of dispensed antibiotic items per 1,000 population was 126 98 (95% CI 125 68–128 27) in the feedback intervention group and 131 25 (130 33″) “132 16) in the control group, a difference of 4 27 (3 3%""; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0 967 [95% CI 0 957–0 977 ]; p<0 0001), which represents an estimated 73?406 fewer items of antibiotics dispensed.In December 2014, GP practices were reassigned to patient-centered intervention groups (n=777 ) or control (n=804) did not significantly affect the primary outcome between December 2014 and March 2015 (antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population: 135 00 [95% CI 133 77–136 22 ] in the patient-centered intervention group and 133 98 [133 06–134 90] in the control group, IRR for difference between groups 1 01, 95% CI 1 00–1 02 ; p=0 105) messenger of high per fil can substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing at low cost and on a national scale;"" this result makes it worth adding to antimicrobial stewardship programs.",1,1,

DESIGN Randomized, single-blind trial. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit, North Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 200 mothers of babies in a neonatal intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS Mothers provided (n=102) or non-reported (n=98) audiotapes of their conversations with a neonatologist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Recall of information, attitudes and use of the tape, satisfaction with conversations, postpartum depression, anxiety, general health and parenting stress, at 10 days and at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS Ninety-one percent (n=93) of the mothers in the tape group listened to the tape (once at day 10, twice at four months, and three times at 12 months""; range 1-10). At 10 days and at four months, Mothers in the tape group recalled significantly more information about diagnosis, treatment, and outcome than mothers in the control group At four months, mothers in the tape group had a 75 % more likely to remember all treatment information than mothers in the control group (59% vs 34%, relative risk 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.4). mothers, all in the control group, could not recall their conversations.No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in satisfaction with the conversations (10 days), postpartum depression and anxiety scores (10 days, four and 12 months). ) and parenting stress (12 months). providing mothers of babies in neonatal intensive care units with audiotapes of conversations with a neonatologist improved their recall of information (up to four months). The recorded conversations did not affect the mothers' well-being or satisfaction with the neonatologist. TRIAL REGISTRATION Australian Clinical Trials Registry 12606000478516.",0,0,

1499,Psychoeducation: improving outcomes in bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND: A relevant paradigm shift in the treatment of bipolar disorder began a few years ago"";"" Crucial findings on the usefulness of psychological interventions clearly support a shift from an exclusively pharmacological therapeutic approach to a combined but hierarchical model in which pharmacotherapy plays a central role, but psychological interventions can help bridge the gap between theoretical efficacy and ""real world"" effectiveness. . We hereby review the efficacy of various complementary psychotherapies in the maintenance treatment of bipolar patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature on the subject was carried out, using the MEDLINE and CURRENT CONTENTS databases. Keywords ""Bipolar"", ""Psychotherapy"", ""Psychoeducation"", ""Cognitive-behavioral"" and ""Relapse prevention"" were entered. RESULTS: Psychological treatments specifically designed for relapse prevention in bipolar affective disorder are useful tools in conjunction with mood stabilizers. Most of the recently published psychotherapy studies report positive results in maintenance as an adjunctive treatment and efficacy in the treatment of depressive episodes. Interestingly, several groups around the world reported similar positive results and came to very similar conclusions"";"" Nearly all of the interventions tested contain important psychoeducational elements that include both improving adherence and early identification of prodromal signs, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle regularity, and exploring health beliefs and awareness of patients' disease. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of psychotherapy to improve adherence to treatment and clinical outcome of bipolar patients is today unquestionable, and future treatment guidelines should promote its regular use among clinicians. As physicians, it is our primary duty to offer the best treatment available to our patients, and this includes both evidence-based psychoeducation programs and newer pharmacological agents.",0,0,
1500,Psychological and behavioral interventions for the management of insomnia disorder: an evidence report for an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline,"BACKGROUND: Psychological and behavioral interventions are commonly used for insomnia disorder. PURPOSE: To assess the benefits and harms of psychological and behavioral interventions for insomnia disorder in adults. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PsycINFO through September 2015, supplemented by handsearching. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of psychological or behavioral interventions that were published in English and included adults with insomnia disorder lasting 4 weeks or longer. DATA EXTRACTION: data extraction by a single investigator confirmed by a second reviewer""; double investigator assessment of risk of bias;"" consensus determination of the strength of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty trials at low to moderate risk of bias compared psychological and behavioral interventions with inactive controls or other psychological and behavioral interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved global outcomes and most sleep outcomes after treatment, often compared with information or wait-list controls (moderate strength of evidence). The use of CBT-I improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low- to moderate-strength evidence). Multicomponent behavioral therapy improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low-to-moderate strength of evidence). Stimulus control improved 1 or 2 sleep outcomes (low-robust evidence). Evidence from other comparisons and from harms was insufficient to allow conclusions. LIMITATIONS: A wide variety of comparisons limited the ability to pool data. The trials did not always report overall results and rarely performed a sender or responder analysis. Comparisons were often information or waiting list groups, and publication bias was possible. CONCLUSION: The use of CBT-I improves most outcomes compared to inactive controls. Multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control may improve some sleep outcomes. Evidence on other outcomes, comparisons, and long-term efficacy was limited.",0,0,
1501,Psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder: recommendations for the clinician based on a review of the literature,"This article reviews the available research data supporting the use of psychotherapy in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors highlight how this evidence could inform clinical options in the treatment of PTSD, as well as demonstrate how assumptions based on gaps in the available literature can be misleading. The authors first review findings related to a number of interventions that are commonly used in the treatment of trauma victims or patients with PTSD: critical incident stress reporting, psychoeducation, exposure therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, stress inoculation, trauma management therapy, cognitive therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and hypnotherapy. They also discuss a number of treatment strategies that have recently been studied in PTSD, including imagery rehearsal, memory structure intervention, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. PTSD is associated with significant symptomatic morbidity, although desired outcomes in clinical practice are generally more related to reduced social, interpersonal, and occupational impairment. The most methodologically sound studies, which have typically examined cognitive or behavioral treatments, indicate that psychotherapy helps alleviate symptom severity"";"" however, there is no consistent information about whether these interventions are useful in improving other domains of impairment and associated disability, although these issues are often the greatest concern for patients. The available evidence also does not indicate when and for whom various psychotherapeutic interventions should be provided, or whether different treatment modalities can and should be combined or offered sequentially, as is often done in specialized treatment programmes. Clinicians should keep these issues in mind when reviewing the current (and future) clinical research literature. Unfortunately, the current evidence base on psychotherapy for PTSD provides only limited guidance regarding clinical options in the management of PTSD. Therefore, the authors provide some literature-based clinical guidelines for clinicians treating patients with PTSD.",0,0,
1502,Psychometric Analysis of the Three-Factor Feeding Questionnaire-R18V2 in Adolescent and Young Adult Central Nervous System Tumor Survivors,"PURPOSE: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors are an understudied population at risk of developing adverse health outcomes, including obesity. Long-term follow-up guidelines recommend monitoring people at risk of obesity, which motivates the need for an eating behavior questionnaire. An abbreviated online version of the Three-Factor Dietary Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18v2) has been developed, but its applicability to this population is not yet known. This study investigated the factorial structure and reliability of the instrument in this population. METHODS: AYA-aged CNS tumor survivors (n = 114) aged 15 to 39 years completed the online TFEQ-R18V2 questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the fit of the three-factor structure (uncontrollable eating, cognitive restraint, and emotional eating [EE]) and reliability (internal consistency of the TFEQ-R18v2). Associations between the three factors and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated using linear regression. RESULTS: The theorized three-factor structure was supported in our population (RMSEA = 0.056 and CFI = 0.98) and demonstrated good reliability (alpha of 0.81-0.93). EE (beta = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.02-0.13) was positively associated with BMI, while the other two subscale scores were not. CONCLUSION: The TFEQ-R18v2 instrument shows promise for research and clinical use among CNS tumor survivors of AYA age. The instrument may be a useful tool for researchers to develop personalized weight management strategies. It can also be a valuable tool for clinicians to monitor survivors who are at risk for obesity and to facilitate referral. Our results also suggest that EE in this population should be further investigated as a potential target for intervention.",0,0,

1504,Psychosocial aspects in cardiac rehabilitation: from theory to practice. Position paper of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Section of the European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the European Society of Cardiology,"large body of empirical research shows that psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs) such as low socioeconomic status, social isolation, stress, type D personality, depression, and anxiety increase the risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD). and also contribute to poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prognosis in patients with established coronary heart disease. PSRFs may also act as barriers to lifestyle changes and treatment adherence and may moderate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Furthermore, there appears to be a bidirectional interaction between PSRFs and the cardiovascular system. Stress, anxiety, and depression affect the cardiovascular system through immunological, neuroendocrine, and behavioral pathways. In turn, coronary heart disease and its associated treatments can cause distress in patients, including anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, PSRFs can be assessed with single-item screening questions, standardized questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews. Psychotherapy and medication may be considered to alleviate any PSRF-related symptoms and improve HRQoL, but the evidence for a definite beneficial effect on cardiac endpoints is inconclusive. A multimodal behavioral intervention that integrates counseling for PSRF and coping with the disease should be included within comprehensive CR. Patients with clinically significant symptoms of distress should be referred for psychological counseling or interventions focused on psychology and/or psychopharmacological treatment. To conclude, the success of CR may critically depend on the interdependence of the body and mind and this interaction should be reflected through the assessment and management of PSRF in accordance with sound scientific evidence, by trained personnel and integrated within the core CR team.",0,0,

1506,Putting Evidence into Practice: Evidence-Based Interventions for Sleep-Wake Disorders,"Symptom management is a vital aspect of cancer nursing practice. The Cancer Nursing Society has identified outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention, known as nursing sensitive patient outcomes. This article presents information on sleep-wake disorders that occur in cancer patients and makes recommendations for evidence-based interventions to improve patients' sleep. Sleep-wake disorders occur in 30% to 75% of people with cancer and have a negative impact on other symptoms and quality of life. Despite the frequency and severity of sleep-wake disorders, limited research has tested interventions to improve sleep-wake outcomes. Although no intervention currently receives the highest recommendations for implementation in practice, several nonpharmacological interventions show initial positive findings in promoting high-quality sleep and daytime functioning. Oncology nurses can detect sleep and wake disorders and suggest personalized interventions. Four categories of promising interventions are cognitive behavioral therapy, complementary therapies, psychoeducation and information, and exercise. Clinicians can use the Putting Evidence into Practice (PEP) card and the PEP resources at www.ons.org/outcomes to improve sleep and wake outcomes.",0,0,
1507,Put prevention into practice,"In primary health care settings, disease prevention services are provided at lower rates than recommended. In addition, professionals tend to overestimate the speed at which they perform them. There are essentially two steps in providing evidence-based preventive services: (1) knowing what the evidence is for various screening and intervention maneuvers, and (2) integrating preventive services into daily practice. The first is a scientific process and is carried out in Canada by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. However, after a decade of experience with evidence-based guidelines, we now know that guidelines are not enough. Integrating clinical prevention into busy practices is a political and logistical process. This truth is best captured by the joke: ""An ounce of prevention requires a pound of change from the office system."" Several studies have shown that continuing medical education (CME) courses and workshops for physicians are not sufficient to ensure that clinical preventive services are incorporated into practice. According to Lomas, traditional CME educational approaches need to be complemented with paradigm strategies such as the social influence model, the diffusion of innovation model, and the adult learning model. Battista, in ""From science to practice"", points out the complexity of the communication process required for the diffusion of innovation in practice. Walsh's preventive clinical care systems model better captures the interactive factors that mediate between practitioners' intentions and their actions when it comes to providing preventive clinical services. This paper reports a practical example of how to help GPs develop a ""prevention office support system"" that minimizes barriers, focuses energy, and integrates clinical prevention into office routines. The key components are (i) a practice coordinator for prevention, (ii) clear descriptions of clinical roles related to prevention for all those who deal with patients, (iii) an information management system that strengthens prevention , and (iv) a feedback system and problem-solving strategy.",0,0,
1508,Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis Methods: The INSTINCT Trial,"Patient care practices often lag behind current scientific evidence and professional guidelines. The failure of such knowledge translation (KT) efforts may reflect inadequate assessment and management of the specific barriers faced by both clinicians and patients at the point of treatment level. Effective KT in this setting can benefit from the use of qualitative methods to identify and overcome these barriers. Qualitative methodology allows for an in-depth exploration of the barriers involved in adopting practice change and has been used infrequently in emergency medicine research. The authors describe the methodology for qualitative analysis within the INcreasing Stroke Treatment through INteractive Behavior Change Tactics (INSTINCT) trial. This includes processes for valid data collection and reliable analysis of textual data from focus groups and interview transcripts. INSTINCT is a 24-hospital, randomized, controlled study designed to evaluate a system-based barrier assessment and interactive educational intervention to increase the appropriate use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke. Intervention hospitals undergo a baseline barrier assessment using both qualitative and quantitative techniques (surveys). Researchers obtain data on local barriers to tPA use, as well as information on local attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding the treatment of acute stroke. Target groups at each site include emergency physicians, emergency nurses, neurologists, radiologists, and hospital administrators. Transcript analysis using NVivo7 with a predefined barrier taxonomy is described. This will provide qualitative information on the use of thrombolytics and the importance of site-specific barrier types. Qualitative findings subsequently direct the shape of professional education efforts and system interventions at treatment sites.",0,0,
1509,Qualitative Research Within Trials: Developing a Standard Operating Procedure for a Clinical Trials Unit,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative research methods are increasingly used in clinical trials to address broader research questions than can be addressed by quantitative methods alone. These methods allow health professionals, service users and other interested parties to contribute their views and experiences to the evaluation of treatments, interventions or health care policies and to influence the design of trials. Qualitative data often provides information that is more capable of reshaping policy or influencing design. METHODS: Health services researchers, including investigators, clinicians and qualitative researchers, worked collaboratively to develop a comprehensive portfolio of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the West Wales Rigorous Trials Organization in Health (WWORTH) , a clinical trials unit (CTU) at Swansea University, which recently achieved registration with the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC). Although UKCRC requires a total of 25 SOPs from registered CTUs, WWORTH chose to add an additional Qualitative Methods SOP (QM-SOP). RESULTS: Qualitative methods SOP (QM-SOP) define good practice in the design and implementation of qualitative components of trials, while allowing flexibility of approach and method. Its basic principles are that: qualitative researchers must contribute from the beginning of trials with qualitative potential""; the qualitative component must have clear objectives""; and the main publication of the study must report on the qualitative component. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that CTUs consider developing a QM-SOP to improve quantitative testing by aggregating qualitative data and analysis. We believe that this enhances the value of quantitative assays and contributes to the future development of multi-method assays.",0,0,

Methods Collaborative design of a quality score within the framework of the French clinical research project NosoQual. Feasibility and observational study in 46 surgical services visited between November 2002 and March 2003 according to standardized procedures. A literature review followed by expert consultation, a field test, analysis, and a final reconsideration leading to the definition of a consensus score. Results 138 variables made up the score. They were classified into seven dimensions, each of which represents a different aspect of the quality of care in surgery. According to the threshold and the weight attributed to each variable, the scores for each department were calculated. The average level of achievement of the scores varied from 42% to 71% of the theoretical maximum. The variability of the scores related to the seven dimensions was greater and more significant than that expressed by the global score (coefficient of variation=0.1). Conclusion This analytical work contributed to the design of a quality index for surgery. However, the progress of the score must continue to take into account all the obstacles that were observed and meet the high requirements of the real problem of patient safety.",0,0,

CONCLUSIONS: The sample size was smaller than expected, which contributed to the lack of statistical significance from preintervention to postintervention in patient outcome measures. Systems-level variables that were under the direct control of clinic staff (eg, pneumococcal vaccine administered) showed great improvement. In the pre-intervention period, the percentage of ""yes"" responses to system-level variables ranged from 8 to 24 and jumped from 16 to 95 after the intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This project unequivocally demonstrated that systems-level changes result in better care being delivered to patients"";"" however, these had minimal impact on patient outcome variables.

1514,Quality of pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Magazine advertising is one of the main sources of drug information for physicians. Despite the availability of drug promotion regulations and controls around the world, drug information provided in journal advertising has been criticized in several studies for being of poor quality. However, no attempt has been made to systematically summarize this body of research. This systematic review was designed to assess all studies that examined the quality of pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical and pharmaceutical journals. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, web library, search engine, and citation review (1950 - February 2006). Only articles published in English and examining the quality of information included in pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical or pharmacy journals were included. For each eligible article, an investigator independently extracted data on study methodology and results. The data was then reviewed by a second investigator. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus. Data were analyzed descriptively. The final analysis included 24 articles. The studies reviewed ads from 26 countries. The number of journals surveyed in each study ranged from four to 24 journals. Various outcome measures were examined, including references and claims provided in advertisements, availability of product information, compliance with codes or guidelines, and presentation of risk results. Most studies used a convenience sampling method. In general, the commercial name, the generic name and the indications were provided. Journal articles were commonly cited to support pharmaceutical claims. Fewer than 67% of the claims were supported by a systematic review, meta-analysis, or randomized control trial. Studies that evaluated misleading claims had at least one ad with a misleading claim. Two studies found that less than 28% of claims were unequivocal clinical statements. Most ads with quantitative information provided risk outcomes as relative risk reduction. The studies were conducted in only 26 countries and thus the generalizability of the results is limited. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this review indicates that low-quality magazine advertising is a global problem. Given that the information provided in magazine advertising has the potential to change the prescribing behavior of physicians, continued efforts to increase drug promotion education are crucial. The results of our review suggest the need for a proactive and effective global regulatory system to ensure that the information provided in medical journal advertising supports the quality use of medicines.",0,0,
1515,Quantitative comparison of research in cognitive behavioral therapy and music therapy: a methodological review of best practices to guide future research for adult psychiatric patients,"Although the music therapy profession is relatively young and small, it can treat a variety of clinical populations and has established a diverse research base. However, although the profession originated working with people diagnosed with mental illness, there is a considerable lack of quantitative research on the effects of music therapy with this population. Music therapy clinicians and researchers have reported this lack of evidence and the difficulty of conducting psychosocial research on their interventions (Choi, 1997""; Silverman, 2003a). While published studies have provided suggestions for future research, no study has provided detailed proposals for the methodology and design of a meticulous randomized controlled investigation of high quality psychiatric music therapy How do other psychotherapies achieve their databases and could the field of music therapy borrow from their rigorous ""best methodological practices"" to strengthen its Therefore, as the National Institutes of Mental Health states that the treatment of choice for evidence-based psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), aspects of the literature basis of this psychotherapy were analyzed. The purpose of this literature review was (a) to analyze and id to identify the components of high-quality quantitative CBT research for adult psychiatric consumers, (b) to analyze and identify the variables and other elements of existing quantitative psychiatric music therapy research for adult consumers, and (c) to compare the two data sets to identify the best methodological designs and variables for future quantitative music therapy research with the mental health population. Included is a table that reviews randomized, carefully controlled studies involving the use of CBT for people with serious mental illness to determine the main components of high-quality experimental research designs and the implementation of quantitative clinical research. The table also shows the same components analyzed for existing quantitative psychiatric music therapy research with adult consumers, thus highlighting potential areas and elements for future research. A second table shows a series of possible dependent measures and their sources to be evaluated in future music therapy studies. A third table providing suggestions for future research is derived from a synthesis of the tables and is included to guide researchers and encourage advancement and expansion of the current literature base. The body of the paper is a discussion of the results of the literature analysis derived from the tables, meta-analyses, and literature reviews. It is hoped that this report will lead to the addition of future high-quality quantitative research to the psychiatric music therapy literature base and thereby provide evidence-based services to as many people with mental illness as possible.",0,0,

The median QC duration was approximately 6 months and the median starting and maintenance doses were 23.6 and 40.7 mg/day, respectively (range = 12.5-400 mg/day). The most frequently observed adverse events were drowsiness, followed by dry mouth and lethargy. Our results indicate that actual QC doses for MDD in routine practice should be lower than doses used in placebo-controlled clinical trials and those recommended by a regulatory agency. Well-controlled and adequately powered prospective studies are needed to better understand the exact role of low QC doses in the treatment of MDD, particularly in routine practice.",0,0,
1518,Randomized controlled trial of a complex primary care nurse intervention to increase ambulation in patients aged 60-74 years: PACE-Lift (Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation - Lift) trial protocol,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is essential for the physical and mental health of older people and for maintaining independence. The guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity of at least moderate intensity, with activity on most days. The most common physical activity of the elderly is walking, light intensity if walking, moderate intensity if speeding. Less than 20% of people aged 65 to 74 in the UK report having met the guidelines, even though the majority can. Effective behavior change techniques include strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, developing self-efficacy, and relapse prevention. Physical activity consultations in primary care allow personalized advice. Pedometers measure step count and accelerometers measure the intensity of physical activity. This protocol describes an innovative intervention to increase walking in the elderly, incorporating pedometer and accelerometer feedback within a primary care nursing physical activity consultation, using behavior change techniques. METHODS/DESIGN: DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with intervention and control arms (usual care) plus qualitative and process evaluations. PARTICIPANTS: 300 people aged 60-74 registered in 3 general practices within the Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Primary Care Trusts, able to walk outdoors and without restriction to increase their physical activity. INTERVENTION: 3-month pedometer and accelerometer-based intervention supported by practice nurse physical activity consultations. Four queries based on behavior change techniques, physical activity diary, average daily pedometer steps, and accelerometer feedback on intensity of physical activity. Individual physical activity plans will be developed based on increased walking and other existing physical activities. RESULTS: Change in average daily steps (primary outcome) and average weekly time spent in physical activity of at least moderate intensity (secondary outcome) at 3 and 12 months, assessed by accelerometry. Other outcomes include quality of life, mood, exercise self-efficacy, and injury. Qualitative assessments will explore reasons for non-participation in the trial, acceptability of the intervention to patients and nurses, and factors that enhance or act as barriers to older people increasing their physical activity levels. DISCUSSION: The PACE-Lift trial will determine the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention to increase physical activity among older primary care patients. Steps taken to minimize bias and anticipated challenges will be discussed. Word count 341. TEST REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN42122561.",0,0,
1519,"Randomized controlled trial of Alexander Technique, Exercise and Massage (ATEAM) lessons for chronic and recurrent back pain.","OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of lessons in the Alexander technique, massage therapy, and a doctor's advice to exercise (exercise prescription) together with behavioral advice provided by a nurse for patients with chronic or recurrent back pain. DESIGN Randomized factorial trial. SETTING 64 General Practices in England. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain; 144 were randomized to normal care, 147 to massage, 144 to six Alexander Technique lessons, and 144 to 24 Alexander Technique lessons; half of each of these groups were randomized to exercise prescription. INTERVENTIONS Normal care (control), six massage sessions, six or 24 Alexander Technique lessons, and exercise prescription by a physician with behavioral counseling provided by a nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Roland Morris Disability Score (number of activities affected by pain) and number of days in pain. RESULTS Exercise and Alexander Technique lessons, but not massage, remained effective at 1 year (compared to control Roland Disability Score 8.1: massage -0.58, 95% confidence interval : -1.94 to 0.77, six lessons -1.40, -2.77 to -0.03, 24 lessons -3.4, -4.76 to -2.03, and exercise -1.29, -2.25 to -0.34). Exercise after six lessons achieved 72% of the effect of 24 lessons alone (Roland disability score -2.98 and -4.14, respectively). The number of days with back pain in the last four weeks was lower after the lessons (compared to the control median of 21 days: 24 lessons -18, six lessons -10, massage -7) and the quality of life significantly improved. No significant damage was reported. CONCLUSIONS Individual lessons in the Alexander Technique from registered teachers have long-term benefits for patients with chronic back pain. Six lessons followed by exercise prescription was almost as effective as 24 lessons. TEST REGISTRATION National Research Registry N0028108728.",0,0,
1520,"Randomized controlled trial of Alexander Technique, Exercise and Massage (ATEAM) lessons for chronic and recurrent back pain: economic evaluation","OBJECTIVE An economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise, and lessons in the Alexander Technique for treating persistent back pain. DESIGN Cost-consequence study and cost-effectiveness analysis at 12-month follow-up of a factorial randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain recruited in primary care. INTERVENTIONS Normal care (control), massage and six or 24 lessons in the Alexander technique. Half of each group were randomized to an exercise prescription from a doctor plus behavioral counseling from a nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs to the NHS and to participants. Cost comparison with Roland-Morris disability score (number of activities affected by pain), days in pain, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Comparison of NHS costs with QALY gain, using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS Intervention costs ranged from £30 per exercise prescription to £596 for 24 Alexander Technique lessons plus exercise. The cost of health services ranged from £50 for 24 Alexander Technique lessons to £124 per exercise. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of the individual therapies showed that exercise offered the best value (£61 per disability score point, £9 per additional pain-free day, £2847 per QALY gained). For two-stage therapy, six lessons in the Alexander technique combined with exercise was the best value (64 additional pounds per disability score point, 43 pounds per additional pain-free day, 5332 pounds per QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS An exercise prescription and six Alexander Technique lessons alone had more than an 85% chance of being profitable at values greater than £20,000 per QALY, but the Alexander Technique performed better than exercise across the full range of results. . A combination of six Alexander Technique lessons followed by exercise was the most effective and cost-effective option.",0,0,
1521,Randomized controlled trial of integrated care to reduce disability from chronic low back pain at work and in private life,"OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of an integrated care programme, combining patient-directed and workplace-directed intervention, for patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN Population-based randomized controlled trial. SCOPE Primary care (10 physiotherapy consultations, an occupational health service, an occupational therapy consultation) and secondary care (five hospitals). PARTICIPANTS 134 adults aged 18 to 65 years registered ill for at least 12 weeks due to low back pain. INTERVENTION Patients were randomized to usual care (n=68) or integrated care (n=66). Integrated care consisted of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics, with the participation of a supervisor, and a program of graded activities based on cognitive-behavioral principles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the duration of time away from work (incapacity for work) due to low-back pain until full and sustainable return to work. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity and functional status. RESULTS The median duration to sustainable return to work was 88 days in the integrated care group compared with 208 days in the usual care group (P = 0.003). Integrated care was effective on return to work (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8, P = 0.004). After 12 months, patients in the integrated care group improved significantly more in functional status compared with patients in the usual care group (P = 0.01). Pain improvement between groups did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION The integrated care program substantially reduced disability due to chronic low back pain in private and work life.

1522,Randomized controlled trial of strategies adapted to implement guidelines for the treatment of patients with depression in general practice.,"BACKGROUND: Various methods are available to implement changes in the clinical behavior of general practitioners (GPs). Although passive dissemination of information is generally ineffective, other methods can be variably effective. Few studies have investigated the impact of personalized methods. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tailored methods for overcoming barriers to change using psychological theories are more effective than dissemination alone in implementing depression guidelines among GPs. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sixty general practices in England""; 30 GPs in the control group, 34 in the intervention group. METHOD: Clinicians identified patients with depression before and after implementation of the guidelines (control group n = 192 at the first data collection, n = 181 at the second, intervention group n = 210 at the first data collection and n = 197 at the second) The main outcome measures were: record of adherence to recommendations guideline in medical records; proportion of patients with a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of less than 11 at 16 weeks after diagnosis RESULTS: Compared with the control group, in the GP group receiving a personalized implementation, there were increases in the proportions of patients assessed for suicide risk In the intervention group, the proportion of patients with BDI scores increased d e less than 11 to 16 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is possible to identify the obstacles to implementation and design strategies to address them.

1523,Randomized controlled trial to change the hospital management of unstable angina,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the benefits of a guideline-based educational program to improve the management of unstable angina pectoris (UAP) in hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 37 public hospitals in New South Wales. PATIENTS: 1,872 patients admitted with a diagnosis of UAP between February 1 and June 30, 1996 (initial survey), and 1,368 patients with the same diagnosis admitted between July 1 and December 31, 1998 (follow-up survey). ). INTERVENTION: Educational sessions led by local opinion leaders, featuring guidelines on the management of UAP from the National Council for Health and Medical Research and commentary on local practice using baseline survey data. Sessions were held between March and June 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of evidence-based practice, identified by review of medical records. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use increased in intervention and control hospitals, although the increase was significant only in the former. The use of calcium channel blockers decreased significantly in both intervention and control hospitals. However, the change in medication use between baseline and follow-up did not differ significantly between intervention and control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some appropriate changes in medication use for UAP management between 1996 and 1998, there was no evidence that a guideline-based educational program was beneficial in changing management. This reaffirms the difficulty of changing physician behavior through practice guidelines. Alternative methods to encourage evidence-based practice should be considered.",0,0,

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of hysteroscopies and/or dilations and curettage performed for DUB in women aged 40 years and younger, change in physician behavior, and perceived booking rates of the procedure. RESULTS: At six months, there was no significant effect on the number of hysteroscopies and/or dilations and curettage performed, but there was an increase in evidence-based behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Although the evidence-based educational strategy for adequate screening of young women with DUB resulted in a change in physician behavior when applied to theoretical cases, it did not result in a reduction in hysteroscopy/D&C rates at six months.",0,0,
1525,Randomized clinical trial of a personalized electronic alert requiring a yes response compared to a control group receiving a commercial passive CPOE alert: NSAIDs: warfarin co-prescribed as a test case.,"Background Studies that have looked at the effectiveness of computerized decision support systems in preventing drug interactions have reported modest results due to low provider response to automated alerts. Objective To assess, within an inpatient computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system, the incremental effectiveness of an alert requiring a provider response, intended as a stronger intervention to prevent concurrent orders for warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. (NSAID). Design Randomized clinical trial of 1,963 physicians assigned to an intervention group receiving a personalized electronic alert requiring a yes response or a control group receiving a commercially available passive alert as part of CPOE. The duration of the study was from August 2, 2006 to December 15, 2007. Adherence to the Alert measurements was compared between the study groups. Results The proportion of desired request responses (i.e., not requesting the alert-triggering drug again after firing) was lower in the intervention group (114/464 (25%) personalized alerts issued) than in the intervention group. control (154/560 (28%) ) activation of passive alerts). The adjusted OR for inappropriate request was 1.22 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Conclusion A personalized CPOE alert requiring a provider response had no effect in reducing the concomitant prescription of NSAIDs and warfarin beyond the commercially available passive alert received by the control group. The new CPOE alerts cannot be assumed to be effective in improving prescribing and need evaluation.",1,1,
1526,Randomized controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy compared to usual treatment for persistent insomnia in cancer patients,"PURPOSE: Persistent insomnia is a common complaint in cancer survivors, but is rarely successfully addressed. Adaptation of a validated and cost-effective intervention to cancer care may offer a viable solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of protocol-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia, administered by oncology nurses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, controlled, pragmatic, two-center trial of CBT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in 150 patients (103 women""; mean age, 61 years) who had completed active therapy for breast, prostate, colorectal, or gynecologic cancer.The study followed the CONSORT guidelines.The primary outcomes were sleep diary measures at baseline, after treatment, and at 6-month follow-up.Actigraphic sleep, health-related quality of life (QOL), psychopathology and fatigue were secondary measures. CBT comprised five small group sessions over consecutive weeks, following a manual protocol. TAU represented normal clinical practice;"" appropriate control for a clinical efficacy study. RESULTS: CBT was associated with mean reductions in 55-minute wakefulness per night compared with no change in TAU. These results were maintained 6 months after treatment. Standardized relative effect sizes were large for complaints of difficulty initiating sleep, waking during the night, and for sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed spent asleep). CBT was associated with moderate to large effect sizes for five of seven quality of life outcomes, including a significant reduction in daytime fatigue. There was no significant interaction effect between any of these outcomes and baseline demographic, clinical, or sleep characteristics. CONCLUSION: CBT for insomnia may be clinically effective and feasible to apply in real practice.",0,0,
1527,Randomized controlled trial of an informatics strategy to increase the preventive care of the general practitioner,"BACKGROUND: Previous interventions targeting primary care physicians with the aim of increasing preventive care delivery have shown limited effectiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized continuing medical education program in increasing rates of three screening behaviors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and cervical screening) and identifying three risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, of benzodiazepines) in general practice. METHODS: Nineteen general practitioners were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Those who received the intervention received a computerized feedback system. The intervention was performed using a touch screen computer located in the surgery waiting area. The preventive behaviors of interest were the patient's smoking, alcohol use, use of benzodiazepines, and screening of blood pressure, cholesterol, and the cervix through the Pap smear. Differences in performance by group on each of the outcomes were measured at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. Logistic regression analyzes with generalized estimating equations were performed as the main analyses. RESULTS: At 3-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were evident in the following outcome measures: precise classification of benzodiazepine users (z = 2.8540, P < 0.05); precise classification of non-benzodiazepine users (z = 2.7339, P < 0.05); precise classification of dangerous or harmful alcohol drinkers (z = 2.3079, P < 0.02); blood pressure screening (z = 3.4136, P < 0.001); and cholesterol screening (z = 6.6313, P < 0.001).

1528,Randomized controlled trial of a computer-adapted multiple health behavior intervention in general practice: 12-month follow-up results.,"BACKGROUND: Effective strategies to address noncommunicable disease risk factors are required to reduce rising health care costs. This trial tested the effectiveness over one year of a minimal intervention targeting multiple health behaviors (diet, physical activity, alcohol, and smoking) in a general practice setting, by providing personalized and computer-adapted feedback. METHODS: Patients who had attended a general practice in the previous 6 months were recruited from 21 general practitioners in Brisbane, Australia. Baseline data were collected through self-reports of adherence to ten health behaviors and summarized on a health score of 0 to 10. This randomized controlled trial used a 2x2 factorial design, with one arm randomizing subjects to intervention or control group. The other arm was feedback at baseline (single contact) or further evaluation with feedback at 3 months (double contact). Thus, 4 study groups were created, to which the participants were blindly randomized: A. Intervention with single contact""; B. Intervention with dual contact; C. Control with single contact and D. Control with dual contact. All participants were tested again at 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 4676 randomized participants, 3065 completed questionnaires at 12 months. Both the single and double contact groups improved their 10-item health scores (+0.31 and +0.49 respectively ) relative to the results of the control group (+0.02; p<0.01).Improvements were observed in compliance with the guidelines for fish intake, the type of milk consumed, the intake of fruits and vegetables and the alcohol intake in the single and double contact intervention groups (p<0.01).Both intervention groups showed greater improvement than controls for health behaviors, in addition to red meat intake, smoking, physical activity ca and body weight Interestingly, there was an improvement in reported non-smoking rates in both intervention and control. l groups (3% single contact;"" 4.5% dual contact).

1529,Randomized controlled trial of education and feedback for the implementation of guidelines for acute low back pain,"OBJECTIVE: The effect of clinical guidelines on resource utilization for complex conditions with substantial barriers to physician behavior change has not been well studied. We report the impact of a multifaceted guideline implementation intervention on radiological and specialty service utilization by primary care physicians for the care of acute low back pain. DESIGN: Groups of physicians were randomized to receive guideline education and individual feedback, supporting patient education materials, both or neither. The impact on guideline compliance and resource utilization was assessed over the 12-month period before and after implementation. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen physician groups with 120 primary care physicians and associate physicians from 2-group model HMO practices. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of the guide used an education/audit/feedback model with local opinion leaders. The patient education component included written and videotaped materials on low back pain care. MAIN RESULTS: Physician intervention was associated with an absolute increase in guideline-consistent behavior of 5.4% in the intervention group versus a 2.7% decrease in the control group (p = 0.04 ). The patient education intervention did not produce significant changes in behavior consistent with guidelines, but was poorly adopted. Patient characteristics, including duration of pain, prior history of low back pain, and number of visits during the illness episode, were strong predictors of service utilization and guideline-consistent behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an acute low back pain care guideline supported by education and feedback for primary care physicians was associated with an increase in guideline-consistent behavior. Patient education materials did not improve the effectiveness of the guideline. Implementation barriers could limit the usefulness of this approach in usual care settings.",0,0,

Specialist practice nurses are increasingly facilitating the work of general practitioners and self-monitoring devices have been developed as an aid to advice. The aim of this study was to compare standard treatment supported by self-management with standard treatment without self-management, both performed by practicing nurses, on cardiovascular risk and separate risk factors. METHODS: Men aged 50 to 75 years and women aged 55 to 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, but with a 10-year SCORE risk of cardiovascular mortality >/= 5% and at least one treatable risk factor (smoking , high blood pressure, lack of physical activity or overweight), were randomized into two groups. The control group received standard treatment according to the guidelines, the intervention group additionally received proactive advice and self-monitoring (pedometer, scale and/or blood pressure device). After one year, the effect of treatment was analyzed in 179 participants. RESULTS: The SCORE risk assessment decreased 1.6% (95% CI 1.0-2.2) for the control group and 1.8% (1.2-2.4) for the intervention group, the difference between groups was 0.2% (-0.6-1.1). Most risk factors tended to improve in both groups. The number of visits was greater and the visits lasted longer in the intervention group (4.9 (SD2.2) vs. 2.6 (SD1.5) visits p<0.001 and 27 (P25 -P75:20-33 ) vs. 23 (P25 -P75:19-30) minutes/visit p= .048).

DESIGN: Two-arm randomized trial with a duration of 12 months. SETTING: Italian general practitioner wards. Subjects A total of 3,186 men and women aged 18 to 65 years recruited from the medical ward by their GPs. INTERVENTIONS: An educational intervention and booklet on the basics of a healthy diet based on the Italian Guidelines for Correct Nutrition, 1998. The primary goal of the study was to achieve fruit and vegetable intake > 5 servings per day. Control visit every 6 months. Main outcome measures Weight, blood pressure, and 40-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a slightly reduced net intake of meat and a slightly higher net intake of fruits and vegetables, fish products, and olive oil. Body mass index (BMI) changed only in the treatment arm [-0.41, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.11 to -0.53]. The net change at 1 year in the intervention arm was +1.31 (CI 0.90-4.39) for fruit and vegetables, and -0.22 (-0.11 to -0.69) for meat ( servings per week). We also calculate a ""healthy diet score"" that reflects adherence to recommended dietary habits. In the intervention group, the mean score at enrollment was significantly lower than the mean score at the end of follow-up (raw score change = 0.29"" CI 0.19-0.48). No difference was observed in the control group (raw score change = -0.04; CI -0.22-0.02). The score difference from baseline to final visit, comparing the intervention group versus the control group, was statistically significant (P < 0.001) (MANOVA adjusted for sex, BMI, education, and time). CONCLUSIONS: A brief educational intervention by clinicians can induce multiple dietary changes that can lower BMI and potentially reduce chronic disease risk in generally healthy adults.",0,0,

Design: The CDSS was used by ED nursing staff to record children with fever. The CDSS identified children who met the inclusion criteria (1-36 months and fever with no apparent source (FWS)) and provided patient-specific diagnostic management advice. Children at high risk of serious bacterial infection were randomly assigned to the ""intervention"" group (n _x0001_ 74) or the ""control"" group (n _x0001_ 90). In the intervention group, the CDSS provided advice to immediately order laboratory tests, and in the control group, the ER physician first evaluated the children and then decided to order laboratory tests. Results: Compliance with the registry of febrile children was 50% (683/1,399). Adherence to the advice to request laboratory tests was 82% (61/74). Children in the intervention group had a median (25th to 75th percentile) emergency department stay of 138 (104 to 181) minutes. The mean length of stay in the emergency department in the control group was 123 (83-179) minutes. Laboratory tests were ordered significantly more frequently in the intervention group (82%) than in the control group (44%, p 0.001, test _x0001_2). Conclusion: Implementation of a CDSS for the diagnostic management of young children with unexplained fever was successful in terms of compliance and adherence to CDSS recommendations, but had unexpected effects on patient outcome in terms of length of stay. in the emergency department and number of laboratory tests.

METHODS: Sites were selected as conference or PBL using simple randomization. All participants were exposed to similar educational resources to ensure equivalence of treatment. Instruments included standardized program/host evaluation forms and a validated case-based questionnaire with a visual analog scale that measures the confidence level of responses. The latter occurred immediately before and after the intervention and 3 months later. The statistician was blinded to the intervention groups. RESULTS: Overall, 52 family physicians agreed to participate, 23 in the PBL sessions (mean 4.6 per group) and 29 in the didactic conference sessions (mean 7.25). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the knowledge acquired in each application of the test. Participants rated the speaker/facilitator equally highly for having established a positive learning environment. PBL participants rated the perceived educational value of the program higher than conference participants (4.36 vs. 3.93"";"" p = 0.04). Both groups experienced a significant increase in asthma-related knowledge after the intervention. Attrition rates for the 3-month post-test were 14% for PBL participants vs. 32% for conference-based participants. DISCUSSION: PBL was as effective in knowledge acquisition and retention as conference-based continuing medical education (CME) programs. Further study is warranted to investigate whether the assessment of higher educational value or increased response rate to delayed testing is replicable in other RCTs addressing common confounders and whether these factors influence future participation of CME, changes in physician clinical behavior, or patient health outcomes.",0,0,
1537,Randomized trial to improve prescription safety in elderly outpatients.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a computerized tool that alerted pharmacists when patients aged 65 years and older were recently prescribed potentially inappropriate medications was effective in decreasing the proportion of patients who were dispensed these medications. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized trial. SETTING: US Health Maintenance Organization PARTICIPANTS: All 59,680 health plan members age 65 and older were randomly assigned to intervention (n=29,840) or usual care (n=29,840). Pharmacists received alerts about all patients randomized to the intervention who were recently prescribed a specific medication. INTERVENTION: Prescription and age information was linked to alert pharmacists when a patient age 65 or older was recently prescribed one of 11 medications that are potentially inappropriate for the elderly. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians and pharmacists collaborated to develop the list of specific medications, indications for use of medications for which an intervention should be performed, intervention guidelines and scripts, and to implement the intervention. RESULTS: During the 1-year study, 543 (1.8%) patients in the intervention group aged 65 years or older received new prescriptions for specific medications, compared with 644 (2.2%) patients in the usual care group ( p = 0.002). For indications of drug use requiring intervention, amitriptyline (p < 0.001) and diazepam (p = 0.02) dispensations were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a computerized pharmacy alert system plus collaboration among health professionals to decrease the dispensing of potentially inappropriate medications in elderly patients. Combining the data available from information systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can improve prescription safety in patients aged 65 and over.",1,1,
1538,Randomized Controlled Trial of the Efficacy of Simulation Education: A 24-Month Follow-up Study in a Clinical Setting,"BACKGROUND: Currently, critical care nurses' knowledge and skills to adhere to evidence-based guidelines to avoid complications associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation are limited. We hypothesized that a single simulation educational session would lead to a higher lasting skill level among critical care nurses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a mixed 22-bed adult medical-surgical intensive care unit in Finland during the period February 2012 to March 2014. Thirty of 40 critical care nurses initially randomized participated. at a 24-month follow-up. -up study. Behavior and cognitive development were assessed through a validated ventilation beam observation program and questionnaire at baseline measurement and repeated 3 times during simulation and in real-life clinical settings. RESULTS: After simulation education, the average skills score increased from 46.8% to 58.8% of the total score in the final measurement after the intervention (Ptime < 0.001, Ptime x group = 0.040 and Pgroup = 0 ,eleven). Mean knowledge scores within groups did not change significantly. The mean between-group difference in skill scores was significant only at the 6-month measurement (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Critical care nurses' abilities to adhere to evidence-based guidelines improved in both groups over time, but improvements between study groups were significantly different only at 6 months and were no longer evident after 6 months. 2 years after a single simulation education.",0,0,
1539,Rapid change in prescribing behavior in hospitals participating in guideline monitoring: stroke after publication of results from the Clopidogrel Treatment of Atherothrombosis in High-Risk Patients (MATCH) clinical trial,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physicians' prescribing patterns are slowly changing despite published randomized trials and consensus guidelines. We measured the effect of the Clopidogrel Management of Atherothrombosis in High-Risk Patients (MATCH) trial on discharge prescribing patterns for patients with stroke and those with transient ischemic attack in the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke program. METHODS: We analyzed the antithrombotic drug prescription patterns at discharge of patients admitted with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in hospitals participating in GWTG-Stroke between October 2002 and January 2006. Clinical information was analyzed by quarter in relation to the publication of the MATCH study. The frequency of prescription of aspirin+clopidogrel at discharge after the MATCH publication was compared with the pre-MATCH period after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and grouping by hospital. RESULTS: A total of 107,872 patients at 632 sites were eligible to receive antithrombotic therapy at discharge. The use of aspirin + clopidogrel therapy decreased from 22.4% to 15.4% of patients after the publication of MATCH (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.70, P <0.0001). Quarterly analysis revealed a rapid and sustained decline in the use of aspirin + clopidogrel therapy during the remainder of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and sustained reduction in the frequency of aspirin + clopidogrel use in ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack was observed after publication of the MATCH trial in the absence of MATCH-specific GWTG-Stroke initiatives and before an update. of the American Heart Association guideline.",0,0,
1540,Rational prescribing in primary care (RaPP): economic evaluation of an intervention to improve professional practice.,"Background Interventions designed to bridge the gap between research findings and clinical practice can be effective, but also costly. Economic evaluations are necessary to judge whether such interventions are worth the effort. We have evaluated the economic effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering medications. The tailored intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial and was shown to significantly increase the use of thiazides for patients started on antihypertensive medications, but had little or no impact on other outcomes. The increased use of thiazides was not expected to have an impact on health outcomes. Methods and findings We performed cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyzes on data from a randomized trial involving 146 general practices from two geographical areas in Norway. Each practice was randomly assigned to either the personalized intervention (70 practices""; 257 physicians) or the control group (69 practices""; 244 physicians). Only patients starting antihypertensive medication were included in the analyses. A multifaceted intervention was designed to address the identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders. The pharmacists made the visits. A cost minimization framework was adopted, where intervention costs were compared with reduced treatment costs (mainly due to increased use of thiazides rather than more expensive drugs). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as the cost per additional patient starting thiazides. The net annual cost (cost minimization) in our study population was US$53,395, which corresponds to US$763 per practice. The cost per additional patient started with thiazides (cost-effectiveness) was US$454. Net annual savings in a national program were modeled at $761,998, or $540 per practice after 2 years. In this scenario, savings outweighed costs in all but two of the sensitivity analyzes we performed, and the return was estimated at $183. Conclusions We found a significant change in the prescription of antihypertensive drugs towards the use of thiazides in our trial. One of the main reasons for promoting the use of thiazides is their lower price compared to other drugs. The cost of the intervention was more than double the savings within the time frame of our study. However, we anticipate modest savings over a 2-year period.",0,1,
1541,Rationale and design of the evaluation study of the effect of cardiovascular drugs provided as evidence-based generic samples (SAMPLES) of low cost,"BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular drugs are frequently underused, leading to higher overall drug costs and cost-related noncompliance. OBJECTIVE: We attempted to evaluate an intervention to encourage the appropriate use of generic cardiovascular drugs without creating administrative or financial barriers that might impede the use of essential drugs. TRIAL DESIGN: The SAMPLES (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide for hypertensive patients and simvastatin for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomly select 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, grouped by medical practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or no samples. We will use data on filled prescriptions obtained from a state-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to conduct an intent-to-treat assessment of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of prescriptions that are generic) and the patient adherence. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs. CONCLUSION: This trial will define the potential role of an innovative approach to stimulate clinically appropriate and cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as patient out-of-pocket costs without sacrificing efficacy and whether this approach results in better adherence to essential cardiovascular medications. This intervention may also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be widely used by private insurers or government payers with the goal of stimulating higher-quality, more cost-effective care.",0,0,
1542,Reasons and consequences of low adherence to standard precautions by the nursing team,"Standard precautions (SP) are recommendations to prevent infections and protect health workers during the provision of care, however, there is still low adherence to these recommendations. Objective To analyze the reasons and consequences of low adherence to standard precautions by nursing staff. Method integrative review of the literature, search in seven databases, from 2005 to 2014. Results 30 articles were selected for analysis. The reasons for low adherence evidenced are related to poor lifelong learning practices, risk behaviors of workers, inadequate provision of equipment and protective equipment and inadequate working conditions. The consequences are accidents and occupational diseases. There are few intervention studies, which are limited to guiding professionals. Conclusions The low adherence to standard precautions is linked to individual aspects of workers, employers and educational institutions. The intervention strategies carried out have been shown to be inefficient by focusing solely on the worker.",0,1,
1543,Visit intervals for oral health in primary care patients,"BACKGROUND: The frequency with which patients should attend a dental checkup and the potential oral health effects of altering the checkup intervals between checkups have been the subject of ongoing international debate for nearly 3 decades. Although recommendations regarding optimal visit intervals vary between countries and dental health systems, general dentists have traditionally advocated dental check-ups every 6 months in many developed countries.

1545,Recent Trends in Violence-Related Behaviors Among High School Students in the United States,"Context Violence-related behaviors, such as fighting and carrying weapons, are associated with serious physical and psychosocial consequences for adolescents. Objective To measure trends in nonfatal violent behaviors among adolescents in the United States between 1991 and 1997. Design, setting, and participants Nationally representative data from the 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys were analyzed to describe the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who engaged in behavior related to violence. The overall response rates for each of these years were 68%, 70%, 60%, and 69%, respectively. To assess the statistical significance of time trends for these variables, logistic regression analyzes were performed that controlled for gender, grade, and race/ethnicity and simultaneously tested for linear and higher-order effects. Main outcome measures Self-reported carrying of weapons, physical fights, fight-related injuries, feeling unsafe, and property damaged or stolen. Results Between 1991 and 1997, the percentage of students in a physical fight decreased 14%, from 42.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.1%-44.9%) to 36.6% (95 % CI, 34.6%-38.6%)""; the percentage of students injured in a physical fight decreased 20%, from 4.4% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.2%) to 3.5% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.1%); and the percentage of students who carried a weapon decreased by 30%, from 26.1% (95% CI, 23.8%-28 .4%) to 18.3% (95% CI, 16.5%-20.1%). Between 1993 and 1997, the percentage of students who carried a weapon decreased from 25% to 7.9% (95% CI, 6.6%-9.2%) to 5.9% (95% CI, 5.1%-6.7%); the percentage of students in a physical fight on school property decreased 9%, from 16.2% (95% CI, 15.0%-17.4%) to 14.8% (95% CI, 13.5%-16.1%);"" and the percentage of students carrying a weapon on school property decreased by 28%, from 11.8% (95% CI, 10.4%-13.2%) to 8.5% (95% CI, 7.0 %-10.0%). All of these changes represent significant linear decreases. Conclusions The declines in fighting and gun ownership among US adolescents between 1991 and 1997 are encouraging and consistent with declines in homicide, nonfatal victimization, and school delinquency rates. Further research should explore why behaviors related to interpersonal violence are declining and what types of interventions are most effective.",0,0,
1546,Recommendations for the treatment of depression in older community adults,"OBJECTIVE: To present recommendations for community treatment of depression in old age to public health and aging networks. METHODS: An expert panel of mental health and public health researchers and community professionals on aging was convened in April 2006 to formulate consensus-based recommendations. In making recommendations, the panelists considered the feasibility and appropriateness of community-based provision, as well as the strength of the evidence on the effectiveness of the program from a systematic literature review of articles published up to 2005. RESULTS : The expert panel strongly recommended depression care management-based interventions delivered at home or in primary care clinics. The panel recommended individual cognitive behavioral therapy. Interventions not recommended as primary treatments for depression in old age included education and skills training, comprehensive geriatric health assessment programmes, exercise, and physical rehabilitation/occupational therapy. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations for several intervention categories, including group psychotherapy and psychotherapies other than cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary panel of experts determined that recommended interventions need to be disseminated across public health and aging networks, while acknowledging the challenges and obstacles involved. Interventions that were not recommended or had insufficient evidence often did not treat depression primarily and/or did not include a clinically depressed sample when trying to establish efficacy. These interventions may provide other benefits but should not be assumed to treat depression effectively on their own. The panelists also identified the primary prevention of depression as a highly understudied area. These findings should help individual clinicians, as well as public health decision makers, in the delivery of population-based mental health services in various community settings.",0,0,
1547,Recommendation service for patients with chronic diseases in the home environment of multi-model sensors,"With advanced technologies available, there are potential applications and services built around monitoring the activities of daily living (ADLs) of older people in nursing homes. Most of the elderly people in these facilities suffer from different chronic diseases such as dementia. Existing technologies focus primarily on medication-free interventions and ADL monitoring to address loss of autonomy or well-being. The monitoring and management of ADLs related to cognitive behaviors for intervention without medication are very effective in improving the conditions of patients with dementia. However, the cognitive functions of patients can be improved if appropriate drug recommendations are given at a given time. Previously, we developed the secure wireless sensor network embedded cloud computing for ubiquitous life care (SC(3)). CS(3) services were limited to monitoring the ADLs of older people with Alzheimer's disease and providing non-medication recommendations to the patient. In this article, we propose a system called the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an integral part of the SC(3) platform. Using Smart CDSS, patients have access to medication recommendations from expert physicians. Physicians are provided with an interface to create clinical knowledge for medication recommendations and to observe the patient's condition. The clinical knowledge created by clinicians as the Smart CDSS knowledge base produces medication recommendations for the caregiver based on each patient's symptoms.",0,0,
1548,Recruiting hospitalized patients for research: how do participants differ from eligible non-participants?,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence for guidelines and interventions. However, much of the eligible population refuses to be studied. OBJECTIVE: To identify differences between participants and eligible non-participants in (1) perceived stress, (2) self-efficacy, (3) recovery expectations, (4) discussion of advance directives, and (5) understanding of a standard prescription label (health literacy) . DESIGN: Quasi-experimental prospective cohort study in 5 acute care hospitals. METHODS: We approached 295 hospitalized patients as they were being recruited for a behavioral intervention and asked them to answer 5 screening questions. We compared respondents' responses to their acceptance of the behavioral intervention and to Medicare claims and enrollment data. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare consent rates based on responses to screening questions. SETTING/PATIENTS: Medicare fee-for-service hospital patients. RESULTS: Patients were less likely to consent to behavioral intervention when they reported feeling unable to control important things in their lives (odds ratio [OR]: 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14 -0.92), had low expectations of recovery (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.45), or were confused by a question (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0, 05-0.24). In contrast, people who answered the medication question incorrectly were more likely to consent to the behavioral intervention (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.12-13.03). There were no significant differences in consent for patients who reported feeling overwhelmed or reported discussing advance care planning with family members or physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized eligible nonparticipants differed on constructs related to perceived stress, expectation of recovery, and health literacy. Recognizing such characteristics may inform strategies to improve hospital intervention recruitment and representation in clinical trials.",0,0,

1550,Recurrence after surgical treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa,"Six to 89 months after surgery, 82 patients who had been treated by radical surgery (118 excisions) for intractable hidradenitis suppurativa were reviewed. Local recurrence rates varied widely by disease site, being low after axillary (3%) and perianal (0%) surgery and high after inguinoperineal (37%) and submammary (50%) excision. Recurrence is the result of improper excision or unusually wide distribution of the apocrine glands, but physical factors such as obesity, local pressure, and skin maceration have played a role in some patients. Recurrence due to inappropriate surgery tended to be the most problematic. At follow-up, 75 (91%) of the patients were satisfied with the results of their operation. A quarter of the patients developed disease in a new anatomic site after the operation. Radical surgery provides good symptomatic control for severe hidradenitis suppurativa of the axillary, inguinoperineal, and perianal regions, but is less satisfactory for submammary disease.",0,0,

Design A mixed methods approach was adopted in the project development phase; in situ simulation was used to assess the efficacy of the newly developed IDEAS prescription chart. Setting A London university hospital. Interventions/Methods A multimodal approach comprising ( 1) an exploratory phase consisting of chart reviews, focus groups, and user input gathering (2) iterative design of the IDEAS prescription chart, and finally (3) testing of the final chart with prescribers using in-situ simulation. observed substantial variation between existing inpatient prescription charts used in 15 different hospitals in the UK Review of 40 completed prescription charts from one hospital demonstrated a number of common prescription errors, including illegibility and difficulty in identifying prescribers Insights from focus groups and direct observations were translated into the design of the IDEAS chart. On-site simulation tests revealed significant improvements in prescribing at t The IDEAS table was compared to the prescribing table currently in use at the study hospital. Medication orders on the IDEAS chart were significantly more likely to include correct dose entries (164/164 vs. 166/174; p=0.0046), as well as the prescriber's printed name (163/164 vs. 0/ 174; p<0.0001) and contact number (137/164 vs. 55/174; p<0.0001). The indication of anti-infectives (28/28 vs 17/29; p<0.0001) and the duration (26/28 vs 15/29""; p<0.0001) were more likely to be completed with the IDEAS table. Conclusions a simulated context, the IDEAS chart Prescribing chart significantly reduced a number of common prescribing errors, including dosing errors and illegibility Positive behavior change was observed without prior education or support, suggesting that some common errors in prescription writing are potentially rectifiable simply through changes to the content and layout of the prescription boxes.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license, which permits to others to distribute, remix, adapt, build on this work for non-commercial purposes, and license its derivative works under different terms, provided that the original work is properly cited and the non-commercial use.

1553,Reducing the amount of blood transfused: a systematic review of behavioral interventions to change clinicians' transfusion practices,"BACKGROUND: Transfusion services have used various techniques to reduce the use of blood products. Given the potential adverse effects of transfusions and the resources consumed in implementing strategies to reduce transfusions, there is a need to understand their effectiveness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to reduce the use of blood products. METHODS: We identified all relevant articles by using electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as manual searches of review articles and personal files. Electronic searches included articles published between January 1966 and May 2003. Searches included the terms blood transfusion, plasma exchange, guidelines, education, practice patterns, and professional practice. The outcomes of interest were the number of units transfused and the proportion of patients receiving transfusions. RESULTS: Nineteen studies examining the effectiveness of single (guidelines, prospective audits, retrospective audits, and reminders) or multifaceted interventions to reduce red blood cell, platelet, plasma, cryoprecipitate, and albumin transfusions met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies demonstrated a relative reduction in the number of units administered (range, 9%-77%) or the proportion of patients receiving transfusions (range, 17%-79%). The reported reductions were qualitatively similar for the different blood products studied. No single intervention or combination of interventions appeared more effective in reducing utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral interventions, including simple interventions, appear to be effective in changing clinicians' transfusion practices and reducing blood utilization. Properly designed clinical trials are still needed to determine the relative effectiveness of different interventions in changing practices.",0,1,

1555,"Reducing therapeutic injection overuse through patient-prescriber interaction group discussions in Kinondoni district, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Inappropriate prescribing of injections has been reported in developing and developed countries. Previous studies in Tanzania showed that more than 70% of patients attending outpatient clinics in private clinics received at least one injection per visit, higher than the WHO recommended target of 10%. This is concerning considering the likelihood of adverse effects from the possible use of unsafe syringes to transmit HIV, hepatitis B and C, polio, and the additional economic impact on the patient and the health care system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of behavioral change interaction group discussion on injection prescribing practices at ten selected public clinics in Kinondoni district, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Records of patient injection prescriptions covering the three-month period prior to the study were obtained from 5 randomly selected control facilities and 5 randomly selected intervention facilities. In each health facility, mothers and prescribers were given IGDs for one month, followed by a survey 3 months after the IGD to determine the impact of the IGDs. Chi-square statistical calculations were performed to compare data on the percentage of prescriptions with an injection prescribed and those conforming to national standard treatment guidelines (STGs) between baseline and 3-month follow-up. The results showed no significant difference between the percentage of prescriptions with an injection prescribed at baseline and 3-month follow-up at public clinics (P>0.05, Chi2 test). STG-compliant prescribed injections were low at baseline and did not improve significantly 3 months later (P>0.05, Chi2 test).

1556,Reduced rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia through a staff education program,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients and results in increases in mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and costs. Preventive measures for VAP are well documented and evidence-based, but remain poorly implemented in most intensive care units. We conducted a pre- and post-intervention observational study to assess whether an educational program focused on preventive practices for VAP could reduce incidence. Six hundred and seventy-seven adult patients, mechanically ventilated for >48 h, were included in the study population. An evidence-based guideline for preventive practices at the bedside was developed and disseminated to intensive care unit staff. The incidence rates of NAR were compared before and after the implementation of the educational program. VAP infection rates were reduced by 51%, from a mean of 13.2+/-1.2 in the pre-intervention period to 6.5+/-1.5/1000 device days in the post-intervention period (mean difference 6.7""; 95% CI: 2.9-10.4, p=0.02). A multidisciplinary educational program targeting intensive care unit staff can successfully reduce VAP incidence rates.

1557,Reduction of clinical abnormalities of the lower extremities in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. A randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of patient, health professional, and systems intervention on the prevalence of lower extremity amputation risk factors in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes. DESIGN: Blinded, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Academic practice of general medicine. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 395 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes who underwent the initial patient evaluation, 352 completed the study. INTERVENTION: The 12-month intervention was multifaceted. Patients received foot care education and signed a behavioral contract for desired foot self-care, which was reinforced by telephone and postal reminders. Healthcare providers were provided with practical guidelines and informative flowcharts on foot-related risk factors for amputation in diabetic patients. In addition, folders for intervention patients had special identifiers that prompted health care providers to: 1) request that patients remove their shoes, 2) perform foot exams, and 3) provide foot care education. feet. RESULTS: Patients who received the intervention were less likely than control patients to have serious foot injuries (baseline prevalence, 2.9%; odds ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.16 to 1 .00]; P = 0.05) and other dermatological abnormalities. In addition, they were more likely to report appropriate foot self-care behaviors, to have foot exams during office visits (68% vs. 28%; P < .001), and to receive foot care education by part of health care providers (42% vs. 18%; P < .001). Physicians assigned to intervention patients were more likely than physicians assigned to control patients to examine patients' feet for ulcers, pulses, and abnormal dermatological conditions and to refer patients to the podiatry clinic (10 .6% compared to 5.0%). %;"" p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: An intervention designed to reduce risk factors for lower extremity amputations positively affected patient foot self-care behavior as well as foot care provided by caregivers. healthcare providers and reduced the prevalence of clinical lower extremity disease in patients with diabetes.",0,0,
1558,Referral for advice on fertility preservation in women with cancer,"STUDY QUESTION: What changes can be detected in fertility preservation counseling (FP) (FPC) over time and what are the determinants associated with the referral of patients with newly diagnosed female cancer, from 0 to 39 years of age, to a specialist in reproductive medicine for FPC? ? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although the absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time, only 9.8% of all potential patients (0-39 years of age) were referred in 2011, and disparities were found in referral relative to to the age of the patients, the diagnosis of cancer and the health care provider. -related factors. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Referral rates for FPC prior to initiation of gonadotoxic cancer treatment are low. Determinants associated with low referral and referral disparities have been identified in previous studies, although there are only sparse data on referral practices and determinants for FPC referral in settings with FP(C) reimbursement. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a retrospective observational and questionnaire study in a Dutch university hospital. Data were collected on all cancer patients receiving FP counseling at this center (2001-2013), as well as all newly diagnosed female cancer patients aged 0-39 years in the region (2009-2011). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical records (FPC patients), cancer incidences reported by the Dutch Cancer Registry (to calculate referral rates), and referral professionals (to identify referral rates). reasons for current bypass behavior). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 2011, a total of 9.8% of patients were referred for PFC. Patients aged 20 to 29 years or diagnosed with breast cancer or lymphoma were more frequently referred compared with patients younger than 20 years or diagnosed with other malignancies. The absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time. Health care provider-related determinants for low referral were not initiating a discussion about fertility-related issues, not knowing where to refer a patient for FPC, and not collaborating with patient associations. LIMITATIONS, GROUNDS FOR CAUTION: Actual referral rates may differ slightly from our estimate, as there may be patients who did not wish to receive FPC. Occasionally, patients may have been referred directly to other regions or may have received ovarian transposition without FPC. By excluding skin cancer patients, we will have underestimated the group of women eligible for FPC, as this group also includes melanoma patients who might have received gonadotoxic therapy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The low referral rates and referral disparities reported in the current study indicate that opportunities exist to improve referral practices. Future research should focus on the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve referral practices, such as patient information materials in oncology departments, discussion messages, or methods to increase physician and patient knowledge of FP techniques and guidelines. .

1562,Rehabilitation of antisocial personalities: treatment through self-governance strategies,"It is widely assumed that offenders with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) reject psychotherapeutic intervention. Some commentators therefore argue that people with the disorder are better handled in the criminal justice system, where, following the introduction of indeterminate sentences, commitment to psychological treatment is coercively linked to the achievement of parole. By comparison, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidelines on the management and treatment of ASPD recommend that those seeking treatment should be considered for admission to specialized psychiatric hospitals. The reason is that prison interventions are under-resourced and treatment of ASPD is not a priority. The rationale is that ASPD offenders can be rehabilitated, if motivated. One problem, however, is that little is known about why ASPD offenders seek treatment or what effect subsequent treatment has on their self-understanding. The aim of this paper is to address these unresolved issues. It is based on the findings of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded qualitative study examining the experiences of convicted male offenders admitted to a specialized personality disorder ward within the security state. media and the doctors who treat them. The data is analyzed with reference to Michel Foucault's work on governance and strategy in power relations. Two arguments are advanced: First, ASPD offenders are motivated by coercive legal pressures to implement a variety of Foucauldian-type strategies to give the false impression of progress in treatment. Second, and related, treatment does not result in changes in self-understanding in the resistant client with ASPD. This presupposes that, at least with respect to this group, Foucault was wrong in asserting that resistance behaviors simply mask the efficacy of treatment norms over time. However, the work concludes that specialized treatment in the hospital setting can produce changes in the self-understanding of the resistive offender, but not if the completion of the treatment results, as usual, in his re-entry into prison.",0,0,
1563,Rehabilitation of children and adolescents,"In recent years, a significant increase in most chronic physical and mental illnesses among children and adolescents has been reported. Therefore, the medical rehabilitation of children and adolescents plays an important role. Therefore, early diagnosis and multimodal intervention in childhood and adolescence are necessary to prevent a chronic course of the disease. Patient education programs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic diseases. Those programs are primarily intended to improve compliance behavior and disease management. Consecutively, health status and quality of life should be improved. Due to the implementation of guidelines and evaluation studies, the quality of rehabilitation programs has improved during the last 15 years. However, future research should develop flexible rehabilitation programs in particular (duration of rehabilitation, rehabilitation near or far from the place of residence, rehabilitation chain with inpatient, partially outpatient and outpatient programmes), the efficacy of which needs to be tested.",0,0,

This article draws on the experimental and clinical behavioral literature, reviewing the mechanisms by which the return of fear can occur. The purpose of the article was to generate a list of treatment recommendations for clinicians with the goal of reducing relapse in successfully treated anxiety disorders. The clinical and experimental literature on the mechanisms of renewal, reincorporation, spontaneous recovery and reacquisition is reviewed. These are linked to the clinical and experimental literature on the return of fear in successfully treated anxiety. A list of recommendations is presented to help reduce the likelihood of relapse in successfully treated anxiety. This list includes methods for use in the behavioral (exposure) treatment of anxiety disorders that aim to improve clinical outcomes. Despite the significant problem of relapse in successfully treated anxiety, there are methods available to reduce the likelihood of relapse through the return of fear. Physicians involved in the treatment of anxiety disorders should be aware of these methods to ensure an optimal outcome for the patient.",0,0,
1565,Relationship of the integrity of health research reports with the approval of reporting guidelines by journals: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the integrity of health research reports is related to the approval of reporting guidelines by journals. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Reporting guidelines from a published systematic review and the EQUATOR network (October 2011). Studies assessing the completeness of reporting using an included reporting guideline (referred to as ""assessments"") (1990 to October 2011""; annex searches January 2012) from searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane or Scopus Methodological Register, depending on the report guideline name STUDY SELECTION English reporting guidelines were included that provided explicit guidance for reporting, described the process of developing the guidance, and indicated the use of a consensus development process The CONSORT statement was excluded as assessments of adherence to CONSORT had been previously reviewed English or French assessments of included reporting guidelines were eligible if they assessed the completeness of study reporting as primary intention and those included studies allowed for the comparisons of interest (i.e. after versus before backup). or magazine and/or endorsement versus no endorsement). DATA EXTRACTION Potentially eligible evaluations of incl. The guidelines studied were initially reviewed by title and abstract and later as full-text reports. If eligibility was unclear, authors of assessments were contacted; Journal websites were consulted for supporting information where necessary. Reporting guidelines were analyzed for completeness of reporting in relation to approval per item and, where consistent with the authors' analysis, a summed mean score. RESULTS 101 reporting guidelines were included. Of 15,249 records retrieved from the evaluation search, 26 evaluations were identified that assessed reporting completeness in relation to approval of nine reporting guidelines. Of these, 13 assessments evaluating seven reporting guidelines (BMJ economic checklist, CONSORT for damage, PRISMA, QUOROM, STARD, STRICTA and STROBE) could be analyzed. The reporting guide items were evaluated by few evaluations. CONCLUSIONS The reporting integrity of only nine of the 101 health research reporting guidelines (excluding CONSORT) has been assessed in relation to journal endorsement. Elements of seven reporting guidelines were quantitatively analyzed, with few evaluations each. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relationship between journal support for reporting guidelines and the integrity of published health research reports. Journal editors and researchers should consider prospectively designed, controlled, collaborative studies to provide stronger evidence.

1566,Reminiscence therapy for dementia,"BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy (RT) has been defined as the vocal or silent recollection of events in a person's life, either alone or with another person or group of people. It usually involves group meetings, at least once a week, in which participants are encouraged to talk about past events, often with the help of photos, music, objects and videos from the past. There is often little consistent application of psychological therapies in dementia services. Several of these 'therapies' were enthusiastically received by health professionals in unstimulating care settings. They were expected to work miracles and their 'failure' to do this has led to their widespread disuse. A systematic review of the available evidence is important to identify the effectiveness of different therapies. Subsequently, guidelines for their use can be made on a solid evidence base. OBJECTIVES: RT involves groups of older people who talk about past events, assisted by aids such as videos, images and files, as a means of communication and reflection on their life experiences. The aim of the review is to assess the effects of RT for dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, EMBASE, OMNI, BIDS, Dissertation Abstracts International, SIGLE, and reference lists of relevant articles up to 1998, contacting specialists in the field. We also searched relevant internet sites and handsearched Aging and Mental Health, the Gerontologist, Journal of Gerontology, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, Current Research in Britain: Social Sciences, British Psychological Society conference proceedings and the Reminiscence database. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials of RT for dementia in the elderly. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were included in the review, but only one trial with 15 participants had extractable data. The results were not statistically significant for either cognition or behavior. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of RT for dementia. The review highlighted the urgent need for more systematic research in the area.",0,0,
1567,"Remission, residual symptoms and lack of response in the usual treatment of major depression in directed clinical practice","BACKGROUND: Although published guidelines recommend continuation of treatment for depression until complete remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning, little is known about the frequency with which remission is achieved in routine practice and the precipitants of depression. termination of treatment when the result of treatment has not been optimal. METHOD: A naturalistic study design examined 1859 patients who received treatment for DSM-III-R major depression between 1995 and 1997 in the national provider network of a managed behavioral health organization (MBHO). Physician ratings of symptoms and deterioration were used to group patients into complete remission, partial remission, and no response. Claims data was used to characterize treatment and identify comorbid medical conditions. RESULTS: Based on physician ratings, approximately 27% to 39% of patients achieved a complete remission. Medical and substance use comorbidity and hospital admission were more frequent in those with partial response to treatment. Only half of the treatment-naive patients received a trial of medication during their treatment. Patient choice was the most common reason for treatment termination, although nearly 40% of clinicians agreed with patients' decisions even when symptoms had not improved. CONCLUSION: Although complete remission rates were comparable to those in clinical trials of antidepressants, the results suggest that clinicians may not recommend continuation and maintenance treatment according to best practice guidelines and that failed treatment often does not include antidepressant medication.",0,0,

1570,Report of the NIH Panel to Define Principles of Therapy for HIV Infection*,"Recent advances in research have provided a substantially improved understanding of the biology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the advent of sensitive tools to monitor HIV replication in infected people, the risk of disease progression and death can be accurately assessed and the efficacy of anti-HIV therapies can be directly determined. Furthermore, when used appropriately, newly available combinations of potent antiviral therapies can achieve prolonged suppression of detectable levels of HIV replication and circumvent the inherent tendency of HIV to generate drug-resistant viral variants. However, as antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has become increasingly effective, it has also become increasingly complex. Familiarity with recent research advances is necessary to ensure that the new therapies available are used in ways that most effectively improve the health and prolong the lives of people infected with HIV. To enable clinicians and people living with HIV to better utilize the rapidly accumulating new information on the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV disease, the Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health sponsored the Panel of NIH to define the principles of therapy of HIV infection. This Panel was asked to define the essential scientific principles that should be used to guide the most effective use of antiretroviral therapies and viral load testing in clinical practice. Based on a detailed consideration of the most current data, the Panel outlined eleven principles that address issues of critical importance to the treatment of HIV infection. These principles provide the scientific basis for the specific treatment recommendations made by the Clinical Practice Panel for the Treatment of HIV Infection sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Reports from both dashboards are provided in this post. Together, they summarize the new data and provide both the scientific basis and specific guidelines for the treatment of people with HIV infection.

We discuss the role of medicine as an agent of social control, the medical reconstruction of problems of a and the need for a more coherent policy framework to guide medical practices."" PIP: Reproductive issues are highly controversial. Women's legal right to abortion continues to be challenged, women's rights face rights of the fetus and there is concern about adolescent pregnancy, the appropriate use of reproductive technology and the use of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy.However, little attention has been paid to the role of medicine as an agent of social control and arbiter of reproductive behavior, medical reconstruction and intervention in problems that are essentially of a social nature, or of equity and social justice in the a reproductive health care. The authors discuss these latter issues in light of historical and more recent attempts to control the behavior of pregnant women. In the absence of current reproductive health policy, the medical profession makes arbitrary decisions in individual cases that may or may not reflect the wishes of the patient or the community. A more coherent policy framework and regulatory mechanisms are needed to guide medical practice. The authors discuss the problem in context, the key questions, social discrimination in reproductive health care, choice of what services to provide, coercion and choice, and reproductive health policy as a solution.",0,0,
1572,Requiring physicians to respond to computerized reminders improves their compliance with preventive care protocols.,"Objective: To improve compliance with computer-generated reminders for fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs), mammograms, and cervical Pap tests. Design: six-month prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Academic practice of primary care general internal medicine. Subjects: Thirty-one professors of general internal medicine, 145 residents, and 5407 patients with scheduled visits who were eligible for any of the three cancer screening protocols. Intervention: Primary care teams of internal medicine residents and faculty received routine computerized reminders (control) or the same reminders who were asked to circle one of four responses: 1) ""done/order today"" , 2) "" ""not applicable to this patient"", 3) ""refused patient"", or 4) ""next visit"". p=0.002) and separately with reminders for FOBT (61% vs. 49%, p=0, 0007) and mammography (54% vs. 47%, p=0.036) but not for cervical Pap smears (21% vs. 18%, p=0.2) Intervention residents responded significantly more often than control residents to all recalls together and separately to FOBT and mammography recalls, but not to Pap smears There was no significant difference between intervention and control faculty, but the compliance rate of the control teacher was significantly higher than the rate of control residents for all reminders together and separately for FOBT, but not for mammography or Pap smear. The effect of the intervention was greater in patients ≥70 years, with significant results for all tests, together and separately, for residents but not for teachers. Intervention clinicians felt that reminders were inapplicable 21% of the time (due to inadequate data in patients' electronic medical records) and stated that their patients refused 10% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Asking physicians to respond to computer-generated reminders improved their compliance with preventive care protocols, especially for elderly patients for whom control physician compliance was lowest.

This document describes the underlying theory and its application that the CLAHRC-NDL has adopted, as a case example that could be generalized to practice outside of the CLAHRC, compared to alternative implementation models. Discussion Conventional approaches to health research often generate evidence in isolation from the setting in which it is intended to be used. The premise of the CLAHRC-NDL model is that barriers to implementation can be overcome if knowledge is co-produced by academic and clinical services staff, taking into account the organizational context in which it will be applied. This approach is based on organizational learning theory, recognizing that change is a social and political phenomenon. The evidence is produced in real time, taking fully into account the environment in which it will be deployed. To support this process, senior health service staff are seconded to CLAHRC as Â¡Â®diffusion fellowsÂ¡Â¯ (DF) to actively bridge the gap between research and practice by being a full member of both the team of research as well as its area of clinical research. practice. To facilitate innovation and embed change in the local health community, existing communities of practice are enhanced and new ones are fostered around specific topics. Our approach has been adopted by 16 clinical research studies in the areas of mental health, children and youth, primary care, and stroke rehabilitation. Summary The CLAHRC-NDL implementation model applies organizational learning theory by addressing social and situational barriers and facilitators to implementation and adopting a co-production philosophy.

1578,"Investigation of Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals: REACH Study Protocol, a Multi-Site Staggered Randomized Trial","Background The Research into Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) study will generate evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new cleaning initiative that aims to improve environmental cleanliness in hospitals. The initiative is an environmental cleaning package, with five interdependent, evidence-based components (training, technique, product, audit, and communication) implemented with environmental services personnel to improve hospital cleaning practices. Methods/Design The REACH study will use a stepped randomized controlled design to test the study intervention, an environmental cleaning package, in 11 Australian hospitals. All hospitals in the trial will receive the intervention and act as their own control, and an analysis of change within each hospital will be performed based on data collected in the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomly assigned to one of 11 intervention times with staggered start dates in 2016 and an intervention period of between 20 and 50 weeks. All sites complete the trial at the same time in 2017. The inclusion criteria allow for a purposive sample of public and private hospitals that have higher-risk patient populations for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (objective one) is the monthly number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias (SAB), Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections (VRE), per 10,000 bed days. Secondary outcomes for objective one include thoroughness of hospital cleaning assessed using fluorescent tracer technology, bioburden of frequently touched surfaces after cleaning, and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about cleaning. environmental cleanup.

The use of caregiver-initiated humor as an intervention in healthcare settings has both physiological and emotional benefits. However, little has been written about another very important aspect of humor, patient-initiated humor. When patients use humor to relieve their feelings of stress, uncertainty, or shame, they are trying to communicate with their caregiver. This use of humor by patients is not to ""play down"" the situation, but rather a way to reduce their feelings of dehumanization. Humor is an interactive process of sharing and an important aspect of communication. Patients will watch the caregiver for an answer. An open and accepting response indicates understanding"";"" a negative or no response, however, can serve to isolate the patient.

1581,Responding to youth health risks in primary care: a cluster randomized trial of clinician training in screening and motivational interviewing.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a complex intervention that implements best practice guidelines that recommend clinicians assess and counsel youth on multiple psychosocial risk factors, clinicians' screening for health risks, and behavior of risk of patients, compared with a didactic seminar on the health of young people. . DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster randomized trial in which voluntary general practices were stratified by ZIP code advantage or disadvantage score and billing type (national private, free health, community health center), then randomized into intervention arms or comparison using a computer-generated random sequence. Three months after the intervention, patients were recruited from all practices after consultation for a computer-assisted telephone interview and followed up at three and 12 months later. The investigators who recruited, consented, and interviewed the patients and the patients themselves were blinded to allocation status; doctors don't. SETTING: General practice in metropolitan and rural Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: General practices with at least one interested clinician (GP or nurse practitioner) and their patients aged 14-24 years. INTERVENTION: This complex intervention was designed using evidence-based practices in learning and changing clinical behavior and general practice systems, and included best practice approaches to encourage change in adolescent risk behaviors. The intervention involved training of clinicians. (nine hours) in screening for health risks, use of a screening tool, and motivational interviewing; training of all practice staff (receptionists and doctors) to engage youth; providing feedback to clinicians on patient risk data; and two practice visits to support new screening and referral resources. Comparison physicians received a didac tic educational seminar (three hours) on youth engagement and health risk screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were patient report of (1) physician detection of at least one of six health risk behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, risks of sexually transmitted infections , STIs, unplanned pregnancy and road risks); and (2) change in one or more of the six health risk behaviors at three months or 12 months. Secondary outcomes were likelihood of future visits, trust in physician after exit interview, physician detection of emotional distress and relationship fear and abuse, and emotional distress at three and 12 months. Patient acceptability of the screening tool was also described for the intervention arm. Analyzes were adjusted for practice location and billing type, patients' gender, age, and recruitment method, and prior health risks, where applicable. An intention-to-treat analysis approach was used, including multilevel multiple imputation for missing outcome data. RESULTS: 42 practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison arms. Two intervention practices withdrew their post assignments, prior to training, leaving 19 intervention practices (53 physicians, 377 patients) and 21 comparison practices (79 physicians, 524 patients). 69% of patients in the intervention (260) and comparison (360) arms completed the 12-month follow-up. Intervention physicians discussed more health risks per patient (59.7%) than comparison physicians (52.7%) and thus were more likely to detect a higher proportion of youth with at least one of all six health risk behaviors (38.4% vs. 26.7%, risk difference [RD] 11.6%, confidence interval [CI] 2.93% to 20.3%, odds ratio adjusted [OR] 1.7, CI 1.1 to 2.5). Patients reported less illicit drug use (RD -6.0, CI -11 to -1.2, OR 0.52, CI 0.28 to 0.96) and less risk of STIs (RD -5.4, CI -11 to 0.2, OR 0.66, CI 0.46 to 0.96) ) at three months in the intervention relative to the comparison arm, and for unintended pregnancy at 12 months (RD -4.4, CI -8.7 to -0.1;"" OR 0.40, CI 0.20 to 0.80). No differences were detected between arms in other health risks.There were no differences in secondary outcomes apart from increased detection of abuse (OR 13.8, CI 1.71 to 111), no reports of harmful events, and youth in the intervention had a high acceptance of the screening tool CONCLUSIONS: A The complex intervention, compared to a simple educational seminar for practices, improved the detection of health risk behaviors in young people The impact on health outcomes did not was conclusive The technology that allows a more efficient detection of health risks and systematic approach can allow providers to target counseling to those most at risk.

1584,Results of a collaborative effort of physicians and respiratory therapists to improve long-term metered-dose inhaler technique in a pediatric asthma clinic,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapy, asthma continues to be the chronic condition most responsible for school absenteeism and pediatric hospitalizations. This is especially true for inner city children. We operate a downtown Pediatric Asthma Compliance and Technique (PACT) clinic where physicians and respiratory therapists collaborate to improve metered-dose inhaler (MDI) technique and outcomes among children with asthma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of our strategy to improve MDI technique and asthma outcomes. METHODS: Children referred to the PACT clinic underwent a standardized evaluation based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Expert Panel Guidelines. Physicians demonstrated and reinforced the correct MDI technique at each visit. Using a standardized format, we prospectively collected, at the patient's first visit (T1) and most recent visit (T2), demographic data, MDI technique scores (""MDI steps performed correctly""; scale of 0-8), functional pulmonary, and asthma severity (NHLBI rating scale: 1 = mild intermittent to 4 = severe persistent). Statistical analyzes were performed using parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients who attended the PACT clinic between 1999 and 2002, 15 were excluded from the study due to incomplete data recording.The mean duration from T1 to T2 was 11.8 +/- 9.5 months.At T1 and T2, respectively, the mean MDI technique scores were 53% and 81%, mean overall asthma severity scores were 2.6 and 2.3, and mean overall lung function severity scores were 2.4 and 2.1. the MDI technique significantly improved between T I and T2 (p < 0.001). Black patients had the greatest improvement in the MDI technique (p < 0.001), but lung function test results, overall asthma severity, and lung function severity did not improve significantly. White patients significantly improved both their MDI technique (p = 0.004) and their overall asthma severity scores (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: In our PACT clinic, asthmatic children showed sustained improvement in the MDI technique, with some of the patients improving in lung function and overall asthma severity score.",0,0,
1585,Outcomes That Matter: Structured vs. Unstructured Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in Type 2 Diabetes,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is one component of diabetes management. SMBG presents information on current glycemic status and provides the ability to get immediate feedback on the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on glucose levels. However, SMBG is useful only when the glucose information is properly understood, the data is accurately interpreted, and the results drive appropriate therapeutic actions. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently published guidelines for the use of SMBG in people with diabetes not treated with insulin, recommending that SMBG be used only when patients and/or their physicians have the ability and willingness to incorporate SMBG management and therapy adjustment into your diabetes care plan. If SMBG is used, the IDF also recommends that structured SMBG be performed using defined regimens to meet individual needs. Structured SMBG can be performed as daily glucose profiles that are representative of daily glucose variations. Measurement of pre-meal/post-meal blood glucose (bG) levels on consecutive or alternate days (""paired testing"") also provides powerful glucose information for daily diabetes management. This article reviews recent studies that have appropriately used structured SMBG as an integral component of comprehensive diabetes management and discusses how their findings support IDF recommendations. Our goal is to help clinicians make more informed decisions about the value and usefulness of SMBG in diabetes management.",0,0,
1586,"Rethinking Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials: Introducing the ""Cohort Multiple Randomized Controlled Trial"" Design","Pragmatic trials are important to inform routine clinical practice, but current designs have shortcomings. Clare Relton and colleagues describe the new design of 'multiple cohort randomized controlled trials', which could help address problems associated with existing approaches. ""gold standard"" for establishing how well an intervention works. However, trials purporting to determine the efficacy of a treatment using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design (ie explanatory trials) are sometimes criticized. For example, although explanatory trial design results in strong internal validity, we may rely on the results of a given trial, such trials may have limited external validity: we can â„¢Do not trust that we can apply the results to the usual clinical practice. Pragmatic trials, 1 2 which aim to inform healthcare decision-making in practice, have been offered as a solution because they retain the rigor of randomization (thereby eliminating selection bias) but retain the characteristics of practice normal clinic. The implementation and interpretation of both pragmatic and explanatory randomized controlled trials are associated with significant problems. This article describes a trial design that helps address these issues: the ""cohort multiple randomized controlled trial"" approach. Existing clinical trial designs may be deficient in four areas: recruitment; ethics; patient preferences; and treatment comparisons. ### Recruitment Most randomized controlled trials have difficulty recruiting sufficient numbers of patients. For example, one investigation found that less than a third of 114 publicly funded multicentre trials in the UK recruited their original target number of patients within the originally specified time.3 Failure to target recruitment may have implications for power and generalizability of trial results. In addition, many clinical trials exclude hard-to-reach groups and ethnic minorities,4 leading to disparities between the ""in-need"" (reference) population and the trial population.5 6 Ã¢â'¬ ¦",0,0,

The reason for the controversy is clear. As with adult research, a balance must be struck between two goals: promoting children's health through advances in scientific knowledge and protecting child research subjects from exploitation and harm. However, due to their age and relative immaturity, children cannot protect their own interests as well as adult subjects. However, as they move into adulthood, increasing care must be taken to involve children in decisions that affect them, even to the point of allowing them to make decisions that may have serious and long-term consequences.",0,0,

Cabot, then one of America's best-known physicians, practiced medicine in an era when science redefined medical thought and practice. Although a champion of medical science, Cabot's main concerns were clinical and humanistic. He emphasized the importance of ambulatory medicine, advocated group practice, founded hospital social work, did clinical epidemiological research, pushed for preventive medicine, created the Clinico-Pathology Conference, and wrote extensively on medical ethics. In 1912, despite Cabot's great talents, David Edsall, a general practitioner with a broader basic scientific training, was given a senior professorship at Harvard Medical School. However, Cabot's efforts to define the role of the physician, as well as the health system, in human well-being presaged current attempts in medicine to emphasize the social context of the patient.",0,0,

1596,Risk communication in clinical trials: a cognitive experiment and a survey,"BACKGROUND: A Royal Statistical Society task force recently recommended that ""greater use of numerical, rather than verbal, risk descriptions should be made"" in early human clinical trials. This echoed the views of many physicians and psychologists on risk communication. As the clinical trial industry rapidly expands around the world, it is important to understand risk communication in Asian countries. METHODS: We conducted a cognitive experiment on participation in a hypothetical pain-relieving drug clinical trial and survey in cancer and arthritis patients in Singapore. In part 1 of the experiment, patients received information about the risk of side effects in one of three formats (frequency, percentage, and verbal descriptor) and in one of two sequences (least to most severe and most to least severe), and were asked about their willingness to participate. In part 2, patients received risk information in all three formats, in the same sequence, and were asked again about their willingness to participate. A survey on preference for risk presentation methods and use of verbal descriptors followed immediately. RESULTS: Willingness to participate and the probability of changing their decision were not affected by risk presentation methods. Most patients indicated a preference for the frequency format, but patients with primary education or no formal education were indifferent. Although patients used the verbal descriptors 'very common', 'common' and 'very rare' in a manner similar to the European Commission Guidelines, their use of the descriptors 'uncommon' and 'rare' was substantially different from that of the European Union. CONCLUSION: In this sample of Asian patients with cancer and arthritis, the risk presentation format had no impact on willingness to participate in a clinical trial. However, there is a clear preference for the frequency format. The use of verbal descriptors by lay people was substantially different from that in the EU.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for methotrexate-induced lung injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: One private and five academic rheumatology practices. PARTICIPANTS: Methotrexate recipients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without lung injury. MEASUREMENTS: Potential risk factors examined were sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, medical history, clinical and ancillary characteristics, and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis prior to methotrexate therapy, and characteristics of methotrexate therapy. Cases of lung injury were defined according to the modified Searles and McKendry criteria. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of study participants were white and 67% were female. Case-patients (n = 29) were older than controls (n = 82) (61.5 vs. 54.5 years). The strongest predictors of lung injury, after adjustment for other variables, were older age (odds ratio [OR], 5.1 [95% CI, 1.2 to 21.1]), diabetes (OR, 35, 6 [CI, 1.3 to infinity]), rheumatoid disease, pleuropulmonary involvement (OR, 7.1 [CI, 1.1 to 45.4]), prior use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR, 5.6 [CI, 1.2 to 27.0]) and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 19.5 [CI, 3.5 to 109.7]). Prior use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and hypoalbuminemia had very large attributable risks. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the risk factors that predispose rheumatoid arthritis patients to the lung toxic effects of methotrexate may provide a rationale for monitoring high-risk patients and may facilitate their management.",0,0,

1599,Risk prevalence and cancer screening by general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: This study presents the prevalence of cancer risk and detection rates of patients attending general practitioners. Conditions addressed include smoking, skin cancer, Pap tests, clinical breast exams, and mammography. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 7,160 patients aged 18 to 75 years presenting to 230 general practitioners in a metropolitan and rural region of Queensland, Australia, was used. The prevalence of risk was evaluated from the self-report of risk behaviors of the patients and the screening prior to the consultation. Details of preventive care provided at the consultation were based on physicians' self-report at the end of the consultation. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of the men and 23% of the women smoked, with the rates being higher in the younger age groups.

1601,"Role of ""external facilitation"" in the implementation of research results: a qualitative evaluation of experiences of facilitation in the Veterans Health Administration","Background Facilitation has been identified in the literature as a potentially key component of successful implementation. However, it has been neither well defined nor well studied. Important questions remain about the operational definition of facilitation and about the relationship of facilitation to other interventions, especially other change agent roles when used in multi-faceted implementation projects. Researchers who are part of the Quality Improvement Research Initiative (QUERI) are actively exploring various approaches and processes, including facilitation, to enable the implementation of best practices in the California Health Administration's health care system. Veterans, the largest integrated health care system in the United States. . This paper describes a systematic retrospective evaluation of implementation-related facilitation experiences within QUERI, a quality improvement program developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods A post-hoc evaluation was conducted through of a series of semi-structured interviews to examine the concept of facilitation in several QUERI implementation studies across multiple sites. The interview process is based on a technique developed in the field of education, which systematically enhances experiential learning by stimulating recall and reflection on complex past activities. An iterative content analysis approach was used for data analysis relative to a set of concept-based interview questions. Findings The findings suggest that facilitation, within an implementation study initiated by a central change agency, is a deliberate and valued process of interactive problem solving and support that occurs in the context of a recognized need for improvement and an interpersonal relationship. support. Facilitation was mainly described as a distinct role with a number of potentially crucial behaviors and activities. The data further suggests that external facilitators are likely to use or integrate other implementation interventions, while performing this support and problem-solving role. Preliminary conclusions This evaluation provides evidence suggesting that facilitation could be considered a distinct implementation intervention, just as audit and feedback, educational outreach or similar methods are considered discrete interventions. As such, facilitation needs to be well defined and explicitly evaluated for its perceived usefulness within multi-intervention implementation projects. In addition, researchers should better define the specific contribution of facilitation to implementation success in different types of projects, different types of sites, and with evidence and innovations of different levels of strength and complexity.",0,0,
1602,Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders,"BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is coordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry, funded by the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Financing Authority. This article presents the CPGs on schizophrenia and related disorders. Over the past decade, schizophrenia has become more treatable than ever. A new generation of pharmacological treatments, a revival of psychological and psychosocial interventions, and a first generation of reforms within the specialized mental health system have combined to create a climate of realistic, evidence-based optimism. Progressive neuroscientific advances offer the great possibility of more definitive biological treatments in the near future. However, this improved potential for better outcomes and quality of life for people with schizophrenia has not translated into reality in Australia. The efficacy-effectiveness gap is wider for schizophrenia than for any other serious medical disorder. Therapeutic nihilism, under-resourced services and stalled service reform process, low morale within specialist mental health services, lack of comprehensive recovery and life support programmes, and a climate of persistent stigma and consequent lack of of concern for people. with schizophrenia are the causes that contribute to this failure in effective treatment. Therefore, these guidelines address only one element in the effort to reduce the impact of schizophrenia. They distill the current evidence base and make recommendations based on the best available knowledge. METHOD: A comprehensive literature review (1990-2003), including all Cochrane reviews of schizophrenia and all relevant meta-analyses, was performed, and several recent international clinical practice guidelines were consulted. A series of drafts were refined by the expert committee and improved through a binational consultation process. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of schizophrenia by type of treatment and by stage of illness. The essential features of the guidelines are: (i) Early detection and comprehensive treatment of first-episode cases is a priority, as it can minimize the psychosocial and possibly biological impact of the disease and improve outcome. An optimistic attitude on the part of health professionals is an essential ingredient from the beginning and in all phases of the disease. (ii) A comprehensive and sustained intervention must be ensured during the first 3 to 5 years after diagnosis, since the course of the disease is strongly influenced by what happens in this 'critical period'. Patients should not have to 'try chronicity' before gaining consistent access and retention in specialist mental health services. (iii) Antipsychotic medication is the cornerstone of treatment. These medications have improved in quality and tolerability, but must be used cautiously and more specifically than in the past. The treatment of choice for most patients is now the newer antipsychotic medications due to their superior tolerability and, in particular, reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is particularly true for the first-episode patient where, due to superior tolerability, newer agents are the first-, second-, and third-line choice. However, these new agents are associated with potentially serious side effects in the medium and long term, so patients should be carefully monitored. Conventional low-dose antipsychotic medications may still have a role in a small proportion of patients, where there has been a complete remission and good tolerability"";"" however, the indications are progressively reduced. These principles are now accepted in most developed countries. (vi) Clozapine should be used early in the course, as soon as treatment resistance to at least two antipsychotics has been demonstrated. This usually means incomplete remission of positive symptomatology, but clozapine may also be considered when there are pervasive negative symptoms or significant or persistent suicidal risk. (v) Comprehensive psychosocial interventions should be routinely available to all patients and their families, and provided by appropriately trained mental health professionals with time to devote to the task. This includes family interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, vocational rehabilitation, and other forms of therapy, especially for comorbid conditions, such as substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. (vi) The social and cultural environment of people with schizophrenia is an essential setting for intervention. Adequate housing, financial security, access to meaningful social roles, and the availability of social support are essential components of recovery and quality of life. (vii) Interventions should be carefully tailored to the phase and stage of the disease, and to gender and cultural background. (viii) The genuine participation of consumers and family members in the development and provision of the service must be standard. (ix) The maintenance of good physical health and the prevention and early treatment of serious medical illnesses have been seriously neglected in the treatment of schizophrenia and result in premature death and widespread morbidity. The quality of medical care for people with schizophrenia should be equivalent to the general standard of the community. (x) General practitioners (GPs) should always be closely involved in the care of people with schizophrenia. However, this must be truly shared care, and exclusive care by a GP with minimal or no specialist involvement, while very common, is not considered an acceptable standard of care. Optimal treatment of schizophrenia requires a multidisciplinary team approach with a consultant psychiatrist centrally involved.",0,0,

Having a stroke increases the risk of having another. There are a number of additional known risk factors that can be modified by diet. The present study aimed to systematically review key nutrients and diets and their role in secondary prevention, as well as provide evidence-based guidelines for their use in clinical practice. The work was carried out as part of the process to develop the fourth edition of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) National Clinical Guidelines (NCG) for Stroke. METHODS: The research team generated questions, in consultation with the Virtual Stroke Group, an online professional interest group, and the RCP Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party Guidelines Development Group. Nine questions covering various individual nutrient and diet combinations were defined and searched up to October 31, 2011 using five electronic databases (Embase, Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library and Web of Science). We assessed the quality and risk of bias of all included studies using the van Tulder criteria for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Quality of Meta-analysis Reporting (QUORUM) criteria for systematic reviews. RESULTS: 4287 abstracts were identified, 79 articles were reviewed, and 29 systematic reviews and RCTs were included to provide evidence for the secondary prevention components of the guidelines. For each question, statements of evidence, recommendations, and practical considerations were developed. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review process has resulted in the development of evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice and has identified areas for future research.",0,0,
1605,Saccadic eye movement metrics reflect fatigue in surgical residents,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the effects of surgical resident fatigue on patient safety. We monitored the fatigue levels of surgical residents during the day of their call using (1) eye movement metrics, (2) objective measures of laparoscopic surgical performance, and (3) subjective reports based on standardized questionnaires. BACKGROUND: Previous attempts to investigate the effects of fatigue on surgical performance suffered from methodological limitations, including inconsistent definitions and lack of objective measures of fatigue, and nonstandardized measures of surgical performance. Recent research has shown that fatigue can affect saccadic (rapid ballistic) eye movement characteristics in non-surgical settings. Here we ask whether duty time-induced fatigue (~24 hours) might affect saccadic metrics in surgical residents. Because saccadic velocity is not under voluntary control, a saccadic velocity-based fatigue index has the potential to provide an accurate and unbiased measure of a resident's level of fatigue. METHODS: We measured the eye movements of members of the general surgery resident team at St. Joseph Hospital and Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ) (6 men and 6 women), using a head-mounted video eye tracker ( configuration similar to a surgical device). lighthouse), while performing 3 tasks: 2 simulated laparoscopic surgery tasks (pin transfer and precision cutting) and a guided saccadic task, before and after their call day. Residents rated their perceived level of fatigue every 3 hours during their 24-hour shift, using a standardized scale. RESULTS: Service time decreased saccadic velocity and increased subjective fatigue, but did not affect laparoscopic performance. These results support the hypothesis that saccadic indices reflect gradual changes in fatigue. They also indicate that fatigue due to long service time does not necessarily result in medical error, highlighting the complicated relationship between continuity of care, patient safety, and fatigued providers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show, for the first time, that saccadic velocity is a reliable indicator of subjective fatigue in health professionals during prolonged duty time. These findings have potential impacts for the development of neuroergonomic tools to detect fatigue among healthcare professionals and for the specifications of future guidelines regarding residents' working hours.",0,0,
1606,Security risks associated with the lack of integration and interface of hospital health information technologies: a qualitative study of electronic hospital prescribing systems in England,"Background Substantial sums of money are being invested worldwide in health information technology. However, realizing benefits and mitigating security risks largely depends on the effective integration of information within systems and/or the interface to enable the exchange of information between systems. As part of a research program in English, we explored the social and technical challenges related to integration and interface experienced by early hospitals to adopt hospital-wide, stand-alone multi-module integrated electronic prescribing systems (ePrescribing). Methods We collected longitudinal qualitative data from six hospitals, which we conceptualized as case studies. We conducted 173 interviews with users, implementers, and software vendors (up to three different times), 24 system usage observations and strategy meetings, 17 documents related to implementation plans, and 2 full-day expert roundtables. Data was analyzed thematically initially within cases and then across cases, drawing on insights surrounding information infrastructures. Results We found that integration and interconnection issues hampered the effective transfer of information in both stand-alone and multi-modular systems, resulting in patient safety threats arising from unavailability of timely information and duplicate data entry. Interface issues were immediately apparent on some standalone systems where users were dealing with multiple logins, and this did not abate over time. Multimodular systems appeared at first glance to obviate such problems. However, with these systems, there was a perceived lack of data consistency between modules, leading to challenges in presenting a complete overview of the patient record, possibly due to the fragmented implementation of modules with different functionalities. Although it was possible to access data from some primary care systems, we found poor two-way data transfer between hospitals and primary care that required workarounds, which in turn created the opportunity for new errors associated with information transfer. duplicate and manual. Extending ePrescribing to include modules with other clinically important information needed to support care remained an aspiration at most sites, although some advanced multi-module systems had begun to implement this functionality. However, multi-module systems were found to be difficult to interface with external systems. Conclusions The decision to pursue a strategy of purchasing stand-alone systems and then interconnecting them, or purchasing hospital-wide multi-module systems, is critical for hospitals to realize the vision of a fully integrated digital record, and this must be based on a clear appreciation of the relative trade-offs between these options. While multi-modular systems offered somewhat better usability, stand-alone systems provided greater flexibility and opportunities for innovation, particularly in relation to interoperability with external systems and in relation to adaptability to the needs of different user groups.",0,0,
1607,"Salivary cortisol response after a medical interview: the impact of physician communication behavior, depressive affect, and alexithymia.","OBJECTIVE: To explore whether, and possibly how, a medical interview may affect adrenocortical activity in patients with musculoskeletal pain with and without alexithymia. METHODS: Patients (N = 54) recruited from a fibromyalgia patient organization completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and subgroups with low and high scores, respectively, were selected to participate. Seven physicians made consultations trying to vary their communication according to the given guidelines. All consultations were video recorded and analyzed by the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) to assess the actual content of the consultations. RESULTS: An increase in depressed affect from before to after the interview was associated with relatively high cortisol levels 24 hours after the interview, but only in patients with alexithymia. Physician psychosocial questions were associated with increased depressive affect immediately after the interview, but not with cortisol responses at any time. CONCLUSION: In patients with impaired affect regulation, increased depressed affect after a medical interview may be associated with delayed effects on adrenocortical activity, possibly mediated by rumination. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Providers should be sensitive to potential affect regulation deficits in their patients.",0,0,
1608,"Salt, hypertension and cardiovascular risk","For more than a century, salt and blood pressure have been linked. Prospective randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses provided evidence that a reduction in daily salt intake of 100 mmol will reduce systolic blood pressure by 3-5 mm Hg, while diastolic blood pressure can be reduced by 1 mm Hg. The effect of salt restriction depends largely on individual sensitivity to salt. Whether a reduction in salt intake will ultimately result in a decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be determined in future studies.",0,0,
1609,Do I scan for satisfaction or dig for dismay? Comparison of the results of a postal survey with those of a focus group study,"BACKGROUND: Despite growing support for mixed methods approaches, we still have little systematic understanding of the consequences of combining surveys and focus groups. Although the methodological aspects of questionnaire surveys have been extensively researched, the characteristics of the focus group methodology are little studied. We suggest and discuss whether the focus group setting, compared to questionnaire surveys, encourages participants to exaggerate views in a negative direction. DISCUSSION: Based on an example from our own research, where we conducted a survey as a follow-up to a focus group study, and with reference to theoretical approaches and empirical evidence from the literature on respondent behavior and small group dynamics, We discuss the possibility that a discrepancy in the findings between the focus groups and the questionnaire reflects characteristics of the two different research methods. Unlike the survey, the focus group study indicated that physicians were generally negative about clinical guidelines. We were not convinced that this difference in results is due to methodological flaws in any of the studies, and instead discuss how this difference may have been the result of a general methodological phenomenon. ABSTRACT: Based on studies of how survey questionnaires influence responses, it seems reasonable to say that surveys are more likely to find exaggerated positive opinions. On the contrary, there are some indications in the literature that focus groups can give rise to complaints and overly negative attitudes, but this remains an open question. We suggest that while problematic issues tend to be underreported in questionnaire surveys, they may be exaggerated in focus groups. We argue the importance of increasing our understanding of focus group methodology, for example by reporting interesting discrepancies in mixed methods studies. In addition, more experimental research on focus groups needs to be done to advance the methodology and test our hypothesis.",0,0,
1610,School-based mental health intervention for children affected by political violence in Indonesia,"Context Little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflict in low- and middle-income settings. Children's mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of constant poverty and political instability. Objective To assess the effectiveness of a school intervention designed for conflict-exposed children, implemented in a low-income setting. Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster-randomized trial involving 495 children (81.4% inclusion rate) who had a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.3) years and attended selected schools at randomized in communities affected by political violence in Poso, Indonesia, and were assessed for exposure (=1 events), post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety symptoms compared to a wait-list control group. Unblinded evaluation was carried out before, 1 week after, and 6 months after treatment between March and December 2006. Intervention Fifteen sessions, over 5 weeks, of a manual-based group intervention at school, including learning activities trauma processing, cooperative play and creative activities. -expressive elements, implemented by locally trained paraprofessionals. Main outcome measures We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Childhood Posttraumatic Stress Scale, the Depression Self-Rating Scale, the 5-item version of the Self-Report for Anxiety-Related Disorders, and the Childhood Hope Scale, and assessed impairment of function as treatment outcomes using standardized symptom checklists and locally developed rating scales. Results Correcting for grouping of participants within schools, we found a significantly greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (mean change difference, 2.78""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and hope was maintained (mean change difference, -2.21; 95% CI, -3.52 to -0.91) in the treatment group than in the waiting list group Changes in traumatic idioms (stress-related physical symptoms) (mean change difference, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.12 to 1.11), depressive symptoms (mean change difference, 0.70; 95%, -0.08 to 1.49), anxiety (mean change difference, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.56), and functioning (mean change difference, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.43 to 1.46) were not different between treatment and waiting list groups.ConclusionsIn this study of children in communities affected by violence, an intervention in the school network It reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms and helped maintain hope, but did not reduce traumatic stress-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or functional impairment.",0,0,
1611,Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a two-arm parallel randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a common cause of noncommunicable diseases. The guidelines recommend that clinicians evaluate and offer brief advice to encourage weight loss through referral to behavioral weight loss programs. However, doctors rarely intervene and no trials have been conducted on the subject. We did this trial to establish whether brief physician intervention is acceptable and effective in reducing body weight in obese patients. METHODS: In this two-arm parallel randomized trial, obesity was examined in patients who consulted 137 primary care physicians in England. Individuals could enroll if they were at least 18 years old, had a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2 (or at least 25 kg/m2 if Asian), and had a high percentage of body fat. At the end of the consultation, the clinician randomly assigned the participants (1:1) to one of two 30-s interventions. Randomisation was via pre-prepared randomisation cards, labeled with a code representing allocation, which were placed in sealed opaque envelopes and given to clinicians to open at the time of allocation. treatment. In the active intervention, the physician offered referral to a weight control group (12 sessions of 1 hour each, once a week), and if the referral was accepted, the physician ensured that the patient made an appointment and offer follow-up. In the control intervention, the physician advised the patient that their health would benefit from weight loss. The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population, which was assessed blind to treatment allocation. We also assess patients who are asked about their feelings about talking about their weight when they have visited their GP for other reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense, therefore safety outcomes were not assessed. This trial is registered in the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN26563137. FINDINGS: Between June 4, 2013, and December 23, 2014, we evaluated 8,403 patients, of whom 2,728 (32%) were obese. Of these obese patients, 2256 (83%) agreed to participate and 1882 were eligible, enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 940 people in the support group and 942 people in the counseling group. 722 (77%) people allocated to the supportive intervention agreed to attend the weight control group and 379 (40%) of these people attended, compared to 82 (9%) participants allocated to the counseling intervention. Across the study population, the mean weight change at 12 months was 2.43 kg with the supportive intervention and 1.04 kg with the counseling intervention, giving an adjusted difference of 1.43 kg. (95% CI: 0.89 to 1.97). Patient reactions to brief interventions by general practitioners did not differ significantly between study groups in terms of appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.07, p=0.21 ) or usefulness (1.05, 0.89-1.26, p=0.54)"";"" overall, four (<1%) patients thought their intervention was inappropriate and useless and 1530 (81%) patients thought it was appropriate and useful.

1612,"Screening and Intervention for Comorbid Substance Disorders, PTSD, Depression, and Suicide: A Trauma Center Survey","OBJECTIVE: Little research has examined screening and intervention procedures for comorbid substance use and mental disorders in trauma centers in the United States, even though these disorders are endemic among traumatic injury survivors. In 2006, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) mandated that Level I and Level II trauma centers assess for alcohol use problems and that Level I centers provide brief intervention for those who give positive. The ACS is expected to recommend best practice policy guidelines for screening for substance use problems and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined screening and intervention procedures for the full spectrum of comorbid mental and substance use disorders in US trauma centers. METHODS: Respondents at all Level I and Level I trauma centers were asked II (N = 518) in the United States to complete a survey describing screening and intervention procedures for alcohol and drug use problems, suicidality, depression, and PTSD. RESULTS: There were 391 (75%) respondents. More than 80% of trauma centers routinely screen for alcohol and drug use problems. Routine screening and intervention for suicidality, depression, and PTSD were markedly less frequent"";"" in fact, only 7% of centers reported routine screening for PTSD. Consistent with ACS policy, Level I facilities were significantly more likely than Level II facilities to provide alcohol intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol screening and intervention occurred frequently in US trauma centers and appeared to respond to ACS mandates. In the future, efforts to orchestrate clinical research and policy could improve screening and intervention procedures for highly prevalent comorbid mental disorders.",0,0,
1613,Screening and interventions for overweight in children and adolescents: statement of recommendations,"The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of non-federal experts in prevention and primary care that systematically reviews evidence of effectiveness and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. This recommendation addresses the evidence for the accuracy of screening children and adolescents using BMI, the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacological interventions in improving health outcomes in these children, and the potential harms of routine screening and intervention. Using the USPSTF methodology, an analytical framework with key questions to guide the systematic review was developed, which serves as the basis for this recommendation. The number of overweight children and adolescents has more than doubled in the last 25 years. Childhood and adolescent overweight is associated with increased health risks. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral counseling or other preventive interventions with overweight children and adolescents that can be delivered in primary care settings. Currently available studies are limited by factors such as small sample sizes, poor generalizability, and variable follow-up. Based on this critical gap in the evidence of effectiveness, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for overweight in children and adolescents as a means of preventing adverse health outcomes (recommendation ""I""). There are several gaps in the research evidence on screening and interventions for overweight children and adolescents in the primary care setting. Research is needed to provide well-defined and effective approaches for medical and psychological screening in children, as well as effective clinical approaches for the prevention and treatment of overweight in children that can be implemented by primary care physicians.",0,0,
1614,Suicide risk screening and treatment relevant to primary care: a systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"Background: In 2009, suicide accounted for 36,897 deaths in the United States. Purpose: To review the accuracy of screening instruments and the efficacy and safety of suicide risk screening and treatment in populations and settings relevant to primary care. Data sources: citations from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL (2002 to 17 July 2012)""; gray literature; and a surveillance search of MEDLINE for additional screening trials (July to December 2012). 2012).Study selection: English-language studies of fair or good quality that evaluated the accuracy of screening instruments in primary care or similar populations and trials of interventions for suicide prevention in primary care or mental health settings Extraction data: one investigator extracted data, a second checked abstraction. Two investigators rated study quality. Data synthesis: evidence was insufficient to determine benefit of screening in primary care populations;"" very limited testing identified no serious harm. Minimal evidence suggested that screening tools may identify some adults at increased risk of suicide in primary care, but accuracy was lower in studies of older adults. Minimal evidence limited to high-risk populations suggested poor performance of screening instruments in adolescents. Evidence from the trial showed that psychotherapy reduced suicide attempts in high-risk adults, but not in adolescents. Most trials were underpowered to detect effects on deaths. Limitation: Evidence for treatment was derived from high-risk populations rather than screening populations. Evidence relevant to adolescents, older adults, and racial/ethnic minorities was limited. Conclusion: Feasible primary care screening tools could help identify some adults at increased risk for suicide, but have limited ability to detect suicide risk in adolescents. Psychotherapy may reduce suicide attempts in some high-risk adults, but effective interventions for high-risk adolescents remain unproven.

1616,Frontline colorectal cancer screening,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and practices of primary care physicians regarding colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: We surveyed 77 primary care providers at six clinics in central Massachusetts to assess various factors related to colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Most agreed with the guidelines for fecal occult blood testing (97%) and sigmoidoscopy (87%), which were commonly reported as routine practice. Although the majority (86%) recommended colonoscopy as a screening test for colorectal cancer, it was infrequently reported as routine practice. In addition, 36% considered barium enema as a colorectal cancer screening option and it was rarely reported as routine practice. Despite a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness, office-based digital rectal exams and faecal occult blood testing were commonly reported as routine practice. However, these were generally reported in combination with a guideline-supported trial option. Although only 10% reported that home/fecal occult blood testing was frequently refused, 60% reported that sigmoidoscopy was. Frequently cited patient barriers to compliance with sigmoidoscopy include fear that the procedure will hurt and patients assuming that symptoms occur if there is a problem. Perceptions of health systems barriers to sigmoidoscopy were less strong. CONCLUSIONS: Most providers recommended colorectal cancer screening supported by guidelines. However, patient refusal of sigmoidoscopy was common. Results indicate that multiple levels of intervention, including patient and provider education and systems strategies, may help increase prevalence.",0,0,
1617,Screening for dementia in primary care: an evidence summary for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a large and growing problem, but it often goes undiagnosed in its early stages. Earlier detection and treatment could reduce the burden of suffering from this syndrome. PURPOSE: To review the evidence for the benefits and harms of earlier detection and treatment of dementia. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, experts, and review bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION: The authors developed eight key questions that represent a logical chain between screening and better health outcomes, along with eligibility criteria for admissible evidence for each question. Admissible evidence was obtained by searching data sources. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers abstracted relevant information using standardized extraction forms and graded the article for quality according to US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Brief screening tools can detect some people with dementia early (positive predictive value < or = 50%). Six to 12 months of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors modestly slows the decline in clinical global and cognitive change scores in some patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Function is minimally affected and less than 20% of patients stop taking cholinesterase inhibitors due to side effects. Only limited evidence indicates that any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention slows deterioration in people with early dementia. Although intensive multi-component caregiver interventions may delay nursing home placement for people who have caregivers, the relevance of this finding for people who do not yet have caregivers is uncertain. Other potential benefits and harms of screening have not been studied. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tests can detect undiagnosed dementia. In people with mild to moderate clinically detected Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors are somewhat effective in slowing cognitive decline. The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors or other treatments in people with screen-detected dementia is uncertain.",0,0,
1618,Screening for depression in adult patients in primary care settings: a systematic review of the evidence.,"Background: In primary care settings, estimates of the prevalence of major depressive disorder range from 5% to 13% in all adults, with lower estimates in those older than 55 years (6% to 9%). In 2002, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and treatment. a tracing. Purpose: To conduct an updated systematic review directed for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of assessing depression in adult patients in a primary care setting, the benefits of treating depression in Older adults and the harms of treating depression with antidepressant medications. Data sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, PsycINFO (1998 to 2007), expert suggestions, and bibliographies of recent systematic reviews. Selection of studies: randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials of fair to good quality""; systematic reviews; meta-analyses;"" and large observational studies of serious adverse events and early discontinuation due to adverse effects. All studies were published in English. Data extraction: Two researchers abstracted, critically appraised, and synthesized 33 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data Synthesis: Nine trials of fair or good quality suggest that primary care depression screening and staff-assisted care management programmes, such as case management or the involvement of mental health specialists, may increase the response and remission of depression. The benefit was not evident in screening programs without staff assistance in depression care. Seven regulatory reviews or meta-analyses and 3 large cohort studies indicate no increased risk of completed suicide deaths with antidepressant treatment. The risk of suicidal behavior was increased in young adults (18 to 29 years of age) who received antidepressants, particularly those who received paroxetine, but was reduced in older adults. Limitation: Examination of harms was limited to serious adverse events and mainly used existing systematic reviews. Additional studies published between 2007 and 2008 extend this review. Conclusion: Depression screening programs without substantial supports for staff-assisted depression care are unlikely to improve depression outcomes. Close monitoring of all adult patients starting antidepressant treatment, particularly those under 30 years of age, is important both for safety and to ensure optimal treatment.",0,0,
1619,Hypertension screening,"Purpose: To review the evidence on four questions about screening for hypertension in asymptomatic adults: Is hypertension a significant health problem? Is it detectable at an early, presymptomatic stage? Is treatment available and effective? Do the benefits of screening outweigh the costs and risks? Data identification and selection: We did a computer search of the MEDLARS database to identify community trials of drug therapy for mild hypertension"";"" other relevant citations are included where appropriate. Data synthesis: We address preliminary questions in our analysis through narrative review and argumentation. Estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness of screening was addressed using formal mathematical models of the effect of screening in various US populations. Results of the analysis: Hypertension is clearly a major health problem. It can be detected early and effective treatment is available. Screening for hypertension in asymptomatic adults has benefits that outweigh the risks and costs involved. Based on our estimates, screening is more cost-effective for older adults compared to younger adults and for men compared to women and is highly sensitive to the cost of therapy for mild hypertension. Conclusions: We recommend hypertension screening for all adults. We also discuss the frequency and setting of detection activities. When low-cost therapy is used, the cost-effectiveness of hypertension screening compares favorably with other cardiovascular interventions.",0,0,
1620,Screening for postpartum depression in primary care: cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of routine screening for postpartum depression in primary care. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis with a decision model of alternative depression screening methods, including standardized postpartum depression and generic depression instruments. Screening instrument performance was derived from a systematic review and bivariate meta-analysis across a variety of instrument cutoff points"";"" estimates of other relevant parameters were derived from relevant literature sources and databases. A decision tree considered the entire treatment pathway from possible onset of postpartum depression to identification, treatment, and possible relapse. SCOPE Primary care. PARTICIPANTS Hypothetical population of women who were assessed for postpartum depression either through routine care alone or supplemented by the use of formal screening methods six weeks after delivery, as recommended in recent guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs expressed in 2006-7 prices and impact on health outcomes expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The time horizon of the analysis was one year. RESULTS Routine administration of postnatal or general depression questionnaires did not appear to be cost-effective compared with routine care alone. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (at a cut-off point of 16) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £41,103 (€45,398, $67,130) per QALY compared with routine care alone . The ICER for all other strategies ranged from £49,928 to £272,463 per QALY compared to routine care alone, while the probability that no formal identification strategy would be cost-effective was 88% (59%) with a break-even threshold of £20,000 (£30,000) per QALY. Although sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost of managing misidentified depression (false-positive outcome) was an important factor in the model, formal identification approaches did not appear to be cost-effective on any plausible estimate of this cost. CONCLUSIONS Formal methods of screening for postpartum depression do not appear to represent good value for money for the NHS. The main determinant of cost-effectiveness appears to be the potential additional cost of managing women incorrectly diagnosed as depressed. Currently, formal screening methods for postpartum depression do not meet the National Screening Committee's criteria for adoption of a screening strategy as part of national health policy.",0,0,

Published in the public domain by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Speech and language development is a useful indicator of a child's overall development and cognitive ability and is related to school success. Identifying children at risk for developmental delay or related problems can lead to intervention services and family support at an early age, when the chances for improvement are best. However, optimal methods for screening for speech and language delays have not been identified, and screening is inconsistently practiced in primary care. PURPOSE: We attempted to assess the strengths and limits of the evidence on the effectiveness of screening tests and interventions for speech and language delay in preschool children to determine the balance between benefits and adverse effects of screening. Routine screening in primary care for pattern development in preschool children. the United States Preventive Services Task Force. The target population includes all children up to 5 years of age without previously known conditions associated with speech and language delays, such as hearing and neurological impairments. METHODS: Studies were identified from Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (1966 to November 19, 2004), systematic reviews, reference lists, and experts. The evidence review included only articles published in English that are available through libraries. Only randomized controlled trials were considered to examine the effectiveness of the interventions. Outcome measures were considered if they were obtained at any time or age after screening and/or intervention, provided that the baseline assessment occurred while the child had or = 2 screenings in 1 population, and comparisons of a single detection technique in different populations are lacking. Fourteen good and fair quality randomized controlled trials of interventions reported significantly better speech and language outcomes compared to control groups. Improvement in several domains, including articulation, phonology, expressive language, receptive language, lexical acquisition, and syntax, was demonstrated among children of all age groups studied and in multiple therapeutic settings. Improvement in other functional outcomes such as socialization skills, self-esteem, and improved play themes were demonstrated in some, but not all, of the 4 studies that measured them. In general, intervention studies were small and heterogeneous, may be subject to plateau effects, and reported short-term outcomes based on various instruments and measures. As a result, long-term outcomes are unknown, interventions cannot be directly compared, and generalisability is questionable. CONCLUSIONS: Studies do not support the use of risk factors to guide screening. Several aspects of screening have not been adequately studied to determine optimal methods, including which instrument to use, the age at which screening should be performed, and what interval is most useful. Intervention trials demonstrate improvement in some outcome measures, but conclusions and generalisability are limited. There are no data available that address other key issues, including the effectiveness of screening in primary care settings, the role of enhanced surveillance by primary care physicians before referral for diagnostic evaluation, the long-term benefits timing of interventions and adverse effects of screening. and interventions.",0,0,
1622,Surgeons Screening for HIV Infection: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a policy to screen surgeons for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in preventing HIV transmission to patients undergoing invasive procedures. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: A single national screening program would identify approximately 137 HIV-infected surgeons (range, 28 to 423 surgeons) and prevent approximately 4.3 infections (range, 1.9 to 21.3 infections) in patients treated by infected surgeons. and 0.9 infections (range, 1.9 to 21.3 infections) in patients treated by infected surgeons and 0.9 infections (range, 0 to 12.9 infections) in sexual partners of infected surgeons at a direct cost of $8 .1 million and an induced cost of approximately $44 million. It would result in costs of $458,000 per year of life saved (range, $147,000 to $687,000 per year of life saved), while an annual screening program would cost approximately $1.1 million per year of life saved (range, $338 000 to $1,886,000 per year). year of life saved). If the prevalence of HIV infection in surgeons is estimated to be three times our base case estimate (an increase from 0.1% to 0.3%), annual screening would cost approximately $741,000 per year of life saved. If the probability of seroconversion after a patient is exposed to a contaminated instrument increases to 5.0% from our base case estimate of 0.29%, an annual screening program would still cost more than $228,000 per year of life saved . CONCLUSION: Screening for HIV in surgeons to prevent HIV transmission to patients undergoing invasive procedures requires costs per year of life saved that substantially exceed those of most accepted healthcare interventions. Surveillance studies of patients treated by HIV-infected surgeons should be continued to confirm that transmission of HIV to patients undergoing invasive procedures is rare.",0,1,
1623,"Screening, isolation and decolonization strategies for the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in intensive care units: cost-effectiveness evaluation","OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of detection, isolation, and decolonization strategies in the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units. DESIGN Economic evaluation based on a dynamic transmission model. SETTING England and Wales. Population Theoretical population of patients in an intensive care unit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Infections, deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for alternative strategies, and net monetary benefits. RESULTS All decolonization strategies improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Although universal decolonization (regardless of MRSA status) was the most cost-effective in the short term, strategies using screening to detect MRSA carriers may be preferred due to reduced risk of selection for resistance. Among such targeted strategies, universal admission and weekly polymerase chain reaction screening along with nasal mupirocin decolonization was the most cost-effective. This finding was robust to the size of intensive care units, the prevalence of MRSA at admission, the proportion of patients classified as high risk, and the precise value of willingness to pay for health benefits. All strategies using isolation but not decolonization improved health outcomes but increased costs. Where MRSA prevalence at intensive care unit admission was 5% and willingness to pay per QALY gained was between £20,000 (£23,000;""$32,000) and £30,000, the best such strategy was isolate only patients at high risk of carrying MRSA (either preventively or after identification on admission and weekly screening for MRSA using chromogenic agar) Universal admission and weekly screening using MRSA detection are unlikely to Based on polymerase chain reaction in conjunction with isolation are cost effective unless prevalence is high (10% of patients colonized with MRSA at admission).CONCLUSIONS MRSA control strategies using decolonization are likely to save costs in an intensive care unit setting as long as resistance does not exist, and the combination of universal screening by polymerase chain reaction with decolonization is likely to n represents good value for money if undirected decolonization is considered unacceptable. In intensive care units where decolonization is not implemented, the evidence is insufficient to support universal screening for MRSA outside of high-prevalence settings.",0,0,
1624,Secondary prevention after mild stroke and TIA - usual care and development of a support program,"BACKGROUND: There are effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA, but adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. The study aimed to determine the quality of secondary prevention in usual care and to develop a step-by-step modeled support program. METHODS: Two consecutive cohorts of patients with minor acute stroke or TIAs undergoing routine outpatient care versus a secondary prevention program were compared. Risk factor control and medication adherence were assessed at 6-month follow-ups (6M-FU). Usual care consisted of detailed information on vascular risk factor goals provided at discharge and regular outpatient care by primary care physicians. The step-by-step modeling support program also used up to four outpatient appointments. A combination of educational and behavioral strategies were used. RESULTS: 168 patients from the observational cohort who expressed their willingness to participate in a prevention program (mean age 64.7 years, blood pressure (BP) at admission: 155/84 mmHg) and 173 patients who participated in the support program (mean age 67.6 years, BP: 161/84 mmHg) were evaluated at 6 months. The proportions of patients with AP according to the guidelines were 50% in usual care and 77% in the support program (p<0.01). LDL <100 mg/dl was measured in 62% vs 71% (p = 0.12). The proportions of patients who quit smoking were 50% vs. 79% (p<0.01). 72% vs. 89% of patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulation (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Control of risk factors remains unsatisfactory in routine care. Secondary prevention goals were more frequently met within the supported cohort.

DESIGN Pragmatic randomized controlled superiority trial. SCENARIO 6 outpatient clinics in Manchester and Cambridge. PARTICIPANTS 208 adolescents, aged 11 to 17 years, with moderate to severe major depression or probable major depression who had not responded to a brief initial intervention. Adolescents with suicidal tendencies, depressive psychosis or conduct disorder were included. INTERVENTIONS 103 adolescents received an SSRI and routine care"";"" 105 received an SSRI, routine care, and CBT. The trial lasted 12 weeks, followed by a 16-week maintenance phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change in Health of the Nation Child and Adolescent Outcome Scales score (primary outcome) from baseline with 12 weeks as the primary endpoint and 28 weeks as the follow-up endpoint. Secondary measures were change in Mood and Feelings Questionnaire scores, Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised, Children's Global Assessment Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale. RESULTS At 12 weeks, the treatment effect for the primary outcome was -0.64 (95% confidence interval -2.54 to 1.26, P = 0.50). In a longitudinal analysis, there were no differences in treatment effectiveness for primary (average treatment effect 0.001, -1.52 to 1.52, P = 0.99) or secondary outcomes. On average, there was a decrease in suicidal thoughts and self-harm. There was no evidence of a protective effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on suicidal thinking or action. At 28 weeks, 57% had improved a lot or a lot and 20% were still not improved. CONCLUSIONS For adolescents with moderate to severe major depression, there is no evidence that the combination of CBT plus an SSRI in the presence of routine clinical care contributes to better outcome at 28 weeks compared with provision of routine clinical care. plus one SSRI alone.

Our secondary objective is to explore whether the effects of self-formulated conditional plans are modified by: (i) the form of the plan (for example, implementation intention, action plan, coping plan)""; (ii) fidelity to plan development (not does the individual participate in its development as planned?); and, (iii) complexity of the target behavior (for example, number of actions required; ""regularity of behavior).",0,1,
1628,Self-help books for depression: how can professionals and patients make the right choice?,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and important public health problem most often treated by GPs. A self-help approach is popular with patients, but little is known about its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to review and update the evidence on the clinical effectiveness of bibliotherapy in the treatment of depression. Our secondary objective was to identify which of these self-help materials are generally available to purchase and to examine the specific evidence in these publications. METHOD: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CCTR, PsiTri, and the National Research Register searched for randomized trials evaluating self-help books for depression that included participants older than 16 years with a diagnosis or symptoms of depression. Clinical symptoms, quality of life, costs or acceptability to users were the required outcome measures. Two investigators independently retrieved articles and extracted data. A meta-analysis with a random effects model was performed using the mean score and standard deviation of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at the end of the trial. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified. None met the CONSORT guidelines and all were small, with the largest trial having 40 patients per group. Nine of these evaluated two current publications, Managing Anxiety and Depression (UK) and Feeling Good (US). A meta-analysis of 6 trials evaluating Feeling Good found a large effect of treatment compared to delayed treatment (standardized mean difference = -1.36"";"" 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.76 to - 0.96). Five self-help books available and commonly purchased by members of the public were identified, in addition to the two books that had been assessed in the trials. CONCLUSION: There are several self-help books for the treatment of depression readily available. For most, there is little direct evidence of its effectiveness. There is weak evidence to suggest that bibliotherapy, based on a cognitive behavioral therapy approach, is helpful for some people when given additional guidance. More work is required in primary care to investigate the cost-effectiveness of self-help and the most suitable format and presentation of materials.",0,0,
1629,COPD Self-Care Programs: Moving Forward,"Self-care is increasingly important in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is confusion about what processes are involved, how the value of self-management should be determined, and about research priorities. For more information and agreement on the program content, outcomes, and future directions of COPD self-management, a group of interested researchers and clinicians, all of whom had previously published on this topic and previously collaborated on other projects, called a workshop. This article summarizes their initial findings. Self-management programs aim at structural behavior change to maintain the effects of treatment after the programs have been completed. Programs should include techniques aimed at behavior change, be individually tailored, take into account the patient's perspective, and may vary with the course of the disease and the patient's comorbidities. The evaluation must include process variables. This report is a step towards greater compliance in the field of self-management. To improve clarity regarding effectiveness, future studies should clearly describe their intervention, be appropriately designed and powered, and include outcomes that focus more on the acquisition and practice of new skills. In this way, more evidence and a better understanding of self-management programs will be obtained, and it will be possible to formulate more specific guidelines on self-management.",0,0,
1630,Self-reported use of personal protective equipment among Chinese intensive care physicians during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are often treated in intensive care units (ICUs), posing a significant risk of nosocomial transmission to intensive care physicians and other patients. Despite a large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers have been identified in ICUs, leading to poor compliance with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The use of PPE among critical care physicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the influenza pandemic. This study examined self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and barriers to adherence to PPE use among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during the influenza pandemic. METHODOLOGY/MAIN RESULTS: A survey instrument consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all HCWs in 21 ICUs in 17 provinces of China. A total of 733 physicians, nurses, and other professionals were surveyed, and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. 56% of respondents reported receiving a pandemic influenza training program prior to caring for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported having adequate knowledge of patient and personal protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all PPE components, and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) with PPE use during patient care. On multivariate analysis, 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination, positive attitudes toward PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in the ICU, and patient information on influenza precautions, as well as reprimand for Noncompliance by supervisors was associated with high compliance, while negative attitudes toward PPE use and violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low compliance. CONCLUSION/IMPORTANCE: Knowledge of and self-reported adherence to recommended use of PPE among Chinese critical care physicians is suboptimal. Perceived barriers must be addressed to close the significant gap between perception and knowledge or behavior.",0,0,

This study reports on self-reported violations by nurses in the medication administration process. Objective To assess the extent of violations in the medication administration process among nurses. Design, Setting, and Participants Participants were 199 nurses from two independent US tertiary care urban academic pediatric hospitals working in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), surgical unit (Med/Surg) unit. In a cross-sectional survey, nurses were asked about violations in routine or emergency situations in three steps of the medication administration process. Main outcome measure Self-reported violations of three medication administration protocols were scored using a seven-point scale of 0 to 6 from 'not at all' to 'a great deal'. Results Analysis of variance identified that rape reports were highest for emergency situations, rather than routine operations, highest by nurses from the HOT unit, followed by PICU nurses, and then nurses from the Med/Surg unit. , and higher during patient identification verification, followed by comparing a medication to a medication administration record and then documenting an administration. There was also a significant three-way interaction between rape situation, process step, and unit. Conclusions Protocol violations occur throughout the drug administration process and their prevalence varies depending on the hospital unit, the step of the process and the violation situation. More research is required to determine whether these violations improve or worsen safety, and for those that do worsen safety, how to redesign the management system to reduce the need to violate protocol to perform job tasks.",0,0,

A randomized controlled trial among medical residents,"BACKGROUND: Online medical education is increasing, but its effectiveness compared to existing self-study methods is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the knowledge, learning efficiency, and student satisfaction produced by self-study of print and World Wide Web-based guidelines for care after acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 12 family medicine and internal medicine residency programs at four universities. PARTICIPANTS: 162 residents. INTERVENTIONS: In supervised sessions, participants were randomly assigned to study from print materials or from SAGE (Accelerating Self-Study with Graphic Evidence), a web-based tutoring system. Both methods used identical self-assessment questions and answers and guidance text, but SAGE featured hyperlinks to specific guidance passages and graphical evidence animations. MEASURES: Scores on multiple-choice knowledge tests, score gain per unit of study time, and scores on a student satisfaction scale. RESULTS: Post-immediate test scores on a 20-point scale were similar in the SAGE and control groups (median score, 15.0 vs. 14.5""; P>0.2), but SAGE spent less time studying (median, 27.0 vs. 38.5 minutes; P<0.001) and thus had higher learning efficiency (mean score gain, 8.6 vs. 6.7 points per hour, P = 0.04) On a scale of 5 to 20, SAGE users were more satisfied with learning (mean score, 17.0 vs. 15.0, P < 0.001) After 4 to 6 months, knowledge had decreased to the same extent in the SAGE and control groups (mean score, 12.0 vs. 11.0; P = .12).CONCLUSIONS: Online tutorials can produce greater efficiency and satisfaction in learning than printed materials, but self-study exposure may be insufficient for content retention. long-term insights.

1634,Sertraline as monotherapy in the treatment of psychotic and non-psychotic depression,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective when used alone in the treatment of unipolar depression with psychotic features. The purpose of the present study was to examine the response to sertraline in patients with and without psychotic features using standard criteria such as recovery and remission. METHOD: An 8-week open-label trial of sertraline was conducted in hospitalized depressed patients. Twenty-five subjects had DSM-IV major depressive disorder with psychotic features, and 25 had DSM-IV major depressive disorder without psychotic features. After a 1-week open-label washout, all subjects were rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) at baseline. The HAM-D was given weekly and the BPRS was given again only at the end of the 8-week trial. Drug dosage was started at 50 mg/day, increased to 100 mg/day after 1 week, and then increased to 200 mg/day if subjects had not remitted. RESULTS: Depressed patients without psychosis responded significantly better than depressed patients with psychosis using the criteria of remission (HAM-D score - 7""; p = 0.001), response (HAM-D score - 50% of baseline score; p = 0.011), referral to electroconvulsive therapy (HAM-D score >/= 15, p = 0.011), or change in HAM-D scores (p = 0.016).Baseline HAM-D score and psychosis strongly predicted independent of response, while baseline BPRS scores did not, regardless of whether psychotic status was entered in the analyses.CONCLUSION: Psychotic depression responds worse than depression without psychosis to sertraline alone.Psychosis was a predictor of response independent of degree of depression and general psychopathology Limitations due to an open-label design are discussed, as well as differences between this study and others using SSRIs for psychotic depression.

To highlight areas of development, this study compared the care pathway within a pediatric DCD service with the Scottish NHS framework. METHODS: A UK-based association of researchers and clinicians conducted a qualitative study with 37 participants (N = 13 interview participants, N = 24 workshop participants). In-depth interviews and/or workshops were used to map the DCD service against the NHS framework. The identified gaps were aligned with four key stages of the care process. Qualitative analysis software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Basic principles to guide future development were identified for each phase of the journey. These core principles related to the NHS framework and focused on issues such as family involvement, defining clear pathways and improving children's participation. Participants identified potential strategies to improve service, such as developing community-based interventions and providing information. CONCLUSION: Challenges when providing services for children with DCD include confusing service pathways and poor partnership working. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to use collaborative work strategies that support children's participation. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: There are numerous challenges related to the implementation of best practice principles in the provision of therapy services for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). It is important that AHPs seek ways to involve parents and educational professionals at all stages of the care process to ensure optimal service delivery for the child. Addressing participation is an important aspect and community-based strategies can be particularly beneficial, both as a preventive activity and as an intervention approach.",0,0,

Though distraught and suicidal, the woman insists on protecting the internist, and Jones must decide on her own what course to take. Shapiro, a psychiatrist, points out in his commentary that Jones's actions depend on those of his patient, to whom he has confidentiality obligations. You also have moral and fraternal obligations towards your colleague which may involve contacting a committee of disabled doctors.

1637,"Sex, stroke, and inflammation: the potential for estrogen-mediated immunoprotection in stroke.","Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in the developed world. Experimental and clinical data indicate that stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease, with males demonstrating greater intrinsic sensitivity to ischemic damage for most of their lives. The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well established, however estrogen exposure can also be detrimental, especially in older women. The mechanisms for this remain unclear. Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen in relation to neuronal injury, however cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells. Despite the potent anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen, few studies have investigated the contribution of estrogen to sex differences in the inflammatory response to stroke. This review examines the potential role of estrogen-mediated immunoprotection in ischemic injury. (PsycINFO Database Registry (c) 2017 APA, All Rights Reserved)",0,0,

Activity, function, and patient experience with medical advice about sexual activity after AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N=2,349) and men (N=1,152) aged 18 to 55 years with AMI. The median age was 48 years. Among those who reported discussing sexual activity with a physician in the month after AMI (12% women, 19% men), 68% had restrictions placed on them: limiting sexual intercourse (35%), assuming a role more passive (26%), and/or keeping the heart rate down (23%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07""; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.11), age ( relative risk, 1.05 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.08), and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08). 08-1.15). ;"" 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.66).

RESULTS: There is consensus on many of the attitudinal goals and some of the skills that medical students should acquire in sexual health. There is less consensus about the information related to sexuality that medical students should master. The few common informational targets focus narrowly on the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction and disease. CONCLUSION: Model sexual health curriculum, licensing exams, and professional organization guidelines focus primarily on the pathological aspects of sexuality. Medical students should master the foundational information on healthy sexual function and become familiar with the roles of professionals in various therapeutic disciplines in addressing sexual concerns and improving patients' sexual functioning and well-being. Instruction should also address ways to incorporate this important topic into time-limited interactions with patients.",0,0,

Adjusting for these baseline rates, ED drug users had higher rates of STDs in the year after first ED drug use compared with nonusers in the same period (OR 2.06, p < 0.05). Among ED drug users, STD rates were higher in the year after first ED drug use compared with the year before (327 vs. 289 per 100,000 people per year, p <0.05). to increases in STDs. Conclusions Compared with non-users, erectile dysfunction drug users have higher rates of STDs both before the start of treatment and one year later. At a minimum, this relationship suggests that men using erectile dysfunction medications may benefit from earlier discussions of safer sex practices and tighter control of STDs. It is also possible that the availability of ED medications could increase STD rates.",0,0,
1641,Shared decision making does not influence physicians against clinical practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Although shared decision making (SDM) and adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPG) are important, some believe they are incompatible. This study explored the mutual influence between physicians' intention to participate in SDM and their intention to follow CPGs. METHODS: Embedded in a cluster randomized trial to assess the impact of training physicians in SDM on the use of antibiotics to treat acute respiratory tract infections, this study assessed physicians' intentions to both participate in SDM and follow CPGs. . A self-administered questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior evaluated both behavioral intentions and their respective determinants (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) at entry and at the end of the study. We use path analysis to explore relationships between intents. We performed statistical analyzes using the maximum likelihood method and the variance-covariance matrix. The goodness-of-fit indices included the chi-square statistic, the comparative fit index, and the mean square error of approximation. RESULTS: We analyzed 244 responses at entry and 236 at exit. In the control group, at admission we observed that the doctors' intention to perform SDM (r = 0, t = 0.03) did not affect their intention to follow CPG; however, their intention to follow CPG (r = -0.31 t = -2.82) negatively influenced their intention to participate in SDM. On leaving, neither behavioral intention influenced the other. In the experimental group, on entry neither behavioral intention influenced the other; at exit, the intention to perform SDM still did not influence the intention to use CPG, although the intention to follow CPG (r = -0.15 t = -2.02) slightly negatively influenced the intention to perform SDM, but this was not clinically significant. CONCLUSION: Physicians' intention to participate in SDM does not affect their intention to adopt CPG even after SDM training. Physicians' intention to adopt CPGs did not have a clinically significant influence on intention to participate in SDM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01116076.",0,0,

1646,Importance of chronic fatigue syndrome in rehabilitation medicine: status and prospects,"It appears that from a clinical point of view chronic exhaustion or fatigue is an important factor in rehabilitation. It is, however, primarily a phenomenon that can be described as a function according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (JCF), caused by chronic diseases or chronic excessive stress. The clinical and sociomedical classification of chronic fatigue or burnout with respect to rehabilitation was discussed in the framework of a Workshop at the 12th Rehabilitation Sciences Colloquium, 2003 from the points of view of psychiatric rehabilitation, methodology, sociology and practical rehabilitation, and conclusions for future research were drawn. drawn. The definition of chronic fatigue is based primarily on the feeling of chronic tiredness, but also on phenomena of disturbed concentration, physical discomfort, headache, and ""drive"" and mood disorders. A psychiatric diagnosis related to symptoms of chronic fatigue is neurasthenia, which is arrived at according to precisely defined criteria. Depressive disorder is one of the most important differential diagnoses in this field. Examinations carried out by general practitioners revealed that about 90% of the patients who had been diagnosed with psycho-vegetative disorders fully agreed with the diagnosis of neurasthenia. Neurasthenia resulted more frequently in periods of incapacity for work than in somatization disorders and other psychosomatic diagnoses. Based on the ""IRES"" scale, ""vital exhaustion"", singular or even severe changes, become evident in about 50% to 90% of patients undergoing rehabilitation, depending on their individual range of indications. As expected, most of the pathological findings correspond to patients undergoing psychosomatic rehabilitation, since in these cases they overlap with symptoms of psychosomatic illnesses. However, it is notable that even in somatically oriented orthopedic rehabilitation symptoms of fatigue are observed in up to 50% of patients. Preliminary studies have shown that these symptoms can definitely improve within the framework of rehabilitation, although pathological signs remain abundant on follow-up examinations. Markedly severe degrees of ""vital exhaustion"" and ""vocational exhaustion"" are also observed in rheumatologic patients undergoing somatic rehabilitation. This is consistent with the clinical history details reported by many male and female patients. Therefore, it seems necessary to adapt the rehabilitation intervention to both the psychovegetative and behavioral medical aspects of this symptom. The scientific classification of the entire field of chronic fatigue with respect to rehabilitation requires the classification of the relevant functions within the framework of the ICF. For this, it would be necessary, on the one hand, to carry out patient consultations within cross-sectional studies and, on the other, a systematic consensus process among experts for the assignment to the relevant functions. This is the basis for the development of appropriate assessment tools for use in prospective studies to systematically assess the impact on roles and especially their effects on activities and participation.",0,0,

Furthermore, simulation education had no impact on participants' HH knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: After a single simulation education session, critical care nurses' knowledge and adherence to current HH guidelines remained below target behavioral rates.",0,0,
1649,Sleep disturbance in adults with cancer: a systematic review of the evidence for best practices in assessment and management for clinical practice.,"Sleep disturbance is common in cancer with detrimental effects on health outcomes. Sleep problems are rarely identified or addressed in oncology practice. The purpose of this review was to identify the evidence base for the evaluation and treatment of cancer-related sleep disorders (insomnia and insomnia syndrome) for oncology practice. The health literature search included gray literature data sources and empirical databases from June 2004 to June 2012. Evidence was reviewed by a Canadian panel of sleep experts, comprised of nurses, psychologists, primary care physicians physicians, oncologists, sleep physicians, investigators, and guideline methodologists to develop clinical practice recommendations for pan-Canadian use reported in a separate document. Three clinical practice guidelines and 12 randomized controlled trials were identified as the main source of evidence. Additional guidelines and systematic reviews were also reviewed for evidence-based recommendations on the assessment and management of insomnia, not necessarily cancer. The need to routinely screen for sleep disorders has been identified and randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence suggests benefits for cognitive behavioral therapy to improve sleep quality in cancer. Sleep disturbance is a prevalent problem in cancer that needs further recognition in clinical practice and future research.",0,0,
1650,"Smoking among patients with emergency chest pain: motivation to quit smoking, risk perception and medical intervention","The feasibility of the emergency department (ED) setting for anti-smoking interventions was examined among 159 adult patients presenting with chest pain (38% were smokers). Subjects had been admitted to a 24-h observation unit (OU) to rule out myocardial infarction. We examined the frequency and extent of medical interventions for tobacco dependence using the AHCPR guidelines as a model. We also assessed patients' perceptions of smoking risk and motivation to quit. Results indicate that emergency physicians provided an incomplete and inconsistent intervention. Although most patients were asked if they smoked, only half were advised to quit and few were offered help to quit. The perceived risk of smoking was low among nearly half of all smokers. However, more than three quarters were willing to receive smoking cessation advice while in the emergency department. The emergency department may be an opportune place to initiate smoking cessation counseling for certain high-risk populations.",0,0,
1651,Smoking cessation activities by general practitioners and practice nurses,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the behavior, attitudes and knowledge reported by general practitioners and nurses in relation to smoking cessation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Two postal surveys of national random samples of 303 general practitioners (survey 1) and 459 nurse practitioners (survey 2) covering England and Wales""; effective response rates were 75% and 96%, respectively. RESULTS : Survey 1 found that 96% of GPs agreed that intervening against smoking was part of their role and nearly all (99%) said they recorded smoking status when patients checked in; 57% reported that routinely updated their smoking status records, 50% said they advised smokers to quit during most or all consultations, and 76% said they advised smokers to quit if they were unable to quit A large majority (83%) said they recommend or prescribe nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) Although most GPs (86%) thought NRTs were effective, only a minority Most thought it was worth the cost (47%) or that it should be prescribed by the National Health Service (NHS) (32%). There was little evidence that prior training to stop smoking was associated with more activity, meter More positive attitudes, or greater knowledge. Survey 2 found that nearly all nurse practitioners (99%) agreed that tobacco intervention was part of their role, and 95% said they advise patients to quit smoking at least occasionally; 71% said they advise smokers to quit at most or all visits. A majority (74%) said they recommend NRT to their patients. As with GPs, most nurse practitioners thought nicotine replacement was effective (79%), but fewer (42%) thought the cost was justified, with only around half (53%) ) thought it should be available on NHS prescription. Nurses who said they had been trained to stop smoking participated in more activities related to smoking cessation, had more positive attitudes and were more informed. CONCLUSION: GPs and practice nurses accepted that intervening with smoking was an important part of their role, with a large majority reporting that they intervened with at least some smokers. This represents a promising baseline from which to proceed in terms of implementation of the new smok guidelines for smoking cessation, but it is hoped that improvements can be made in terms of the frequency of updating records and interventions, and the acceptance of the cost-effectiveness of NRT as an intervention to preserve the lifetime.",0,0,
1652,Smoking cessation counseling beliefs and behaviors of outpatient oncology providers,"PURPOSE: Many cancer patients continue to smoke after diagnosis, increasing the risk of treatment complications, reduced treatment efficacy, secondary cancers, and reduced survival. Outpatient oncology providers may not be using the ""teachable moment"" of cancer diagnosis to provide smoking cessation assistance. PROVIDERS AND METHODS: Physicians and midlevel providers (n = 74) providing outpatient oncology services completed an online survey of behaviors, beliefs, and perceived barriers to smoking cessation counseling. The outpatient medical records of 120 patients with breast, lung, head and neck, colon, prostate, and acute leukemia cancer were reviewed to assess current practices for documentation of smoking cessation intervention and assessment. RESULTS: Providers reported commonly assessing smoking in new patients (82.4% often or always), but rates decreased at subsequent visits for both current smokers and recent quitters. Rates of counseling patients to quit smoking were also high (86.5% frequently or always), but less than 30% of providers reported providing interventions to patients who smoke frequently or always (eg, smoking cessation). , nicotine replacement therapy or other medications, self-help materials, and/or referrals). Only 30% of providers reported that they frequently or always followed up with patients to assess progress in quitting smoking. Few providers (18.1%) reported high levels of confidence in their ability to counsel smoking patients. Patients' lack of motivation was identified as the most important barrier to smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Although beliefs about providing smoking cessation services to patients who smoke were generally positive, few providers reported that they commonly provide interventions beyond cessation counseling. Additional training and clinical interventions may improve adherence to smoking cessation practice guidelines in the oncology outpatient setting.",0,0,
1653,Smoking cessation counseling with pregnant and postpartum women: a survey of community health center providers,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated provider performance of smoking cessation counseling steps with low-income pregnant and postpartum women receiving care at community health centers. METHODS: WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) staff, obstetrician physicians, and pediatric physicians at 6 community health centers were asked to complete surveys. Intervention practices (performance), knowledge and attitudes, and organizational facilitators were measured. Factors associated with performance were explored with analysis of variance and regression analysis. RESULTS: Performance scores differed significantly by clinic type and provider. Providers from obstetric clinics had the highest scores and those from pediatric clinics had the lowest scores. Nurse practitioners and nutritionists scored higher than other providers. The type of clinic, greater knowledge related to smoking, older age, and the perception of quitting smoking as a priority were independently related to better counseling performance. CONCLUSIONS: Mean performance scores showed room for improvement in all groups. Low scores for performance of steps beyond assessment and counseling indicate a need to emphasize the steps of assisting and following national guidelines. Providers' own commitment to helping mothers quit smoking was important.",0,0,
1654,Quit smoking from office to bed. An evidence-based practical approach,"Cigarette smoking continues to be a national health care crisis and is responsible for unacceptable levels of suffering, illness and death. Barriers to effective intervention, such as training, time, and reimbursement, are formidable, although the situation is improving as behavioral approaches and appropriate medications become more clearly defined.

1655,Smoking cessation in family medicine: effects of a training program at an area health education center,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many physicians have not received adequate training in smoking cessation. We examined the effects of a tobacco education program on clinicians' behaviour, attitudes, knowledge, and comfort related to smoking cessation. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, family medicine residents and faculty completed a pretest, followed by an educational intervention that included presentations on smoking cessation resources, motivational interviewing, and the neurobiology of addiction and pharmacotherapy. After 3 months, participants completed a post-intervention survey. The results were analyzed using chi-square tests to examine the effects of training. RESULTS: Thirty-three residents and faculty completed the pre-training survey and 25 completed the post-training survey. After training, participants were more familiar and comfortable with the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines (P < 0.0001). No significant differences were found in performance of the 5 A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Help, and Organize) or other behaviors, including providing assistance with counseling, quit plans, resources, or pharmacotherapy. There was no improvement in knowledge of specific intervention plans or in attitudes related to identifying and counseling smokers. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary tobacco training program increases physician familiarity and comfort with practice guidelines and may contribute to improved care activities that promote a healthy lifestyle. Future research should explore other interventions that have the potential to change practice patterns on a larger scale. Future studies should also assess the effect of training programs on patient-oriented outcomes.",0,0,
1656,Smoking cessation: a central role for clinicians,"Physicians are in a unique position to advise smokers to quit because of the ability to integrate the various aspects of nicotine dependence. This review provides an overview of intervention with smokers presenting in a primary care setting. Strategies used for counseling to quit smoking differed depending on the patient's willingness to quit. For smokers who do not intend to quit, clinicians should inform and sensitize patients about tobacco use and cessation, especially by personalizing the benefits of smoking cessation and challenging smokers' beliefs. For dissonant smokers, clinicians should use motivational strategies, such as discussing barriers to quitting and their solutions. For smokers ready to quit, physician should show strong support, help set quit date, prescribe pharmaceutical therapies for nicotine dependence such as replacement therapy and/or bupropion, with instructions for use and suggest behavioral strategies to prevent relapse.",0,0,
1657,Smoking: can we really make a difference?,"The enormous health benefits of quitting smoking are now well established. Physicians play a vital role in motivating smokers and initiating quit attempts. The mainstay of the NHS smoking cessation strategy should be the routine provision of a brief opportunistic intervention in primary care, supported by referral to a specialist smoking cessation service. There is an urgent need to substantially increase the number of smokers referred by general practitioners, other members of the primary care team and those working in acute care hospitals, to specialized smoking cessation services and better channels of communication between the various agencies. The use of pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion) in combination with behavioral support achieves higher quit rates than either component alone and is the most effective way to help smokers quit. Smokers who quit often relapse and will therefore need repeated help.",0,0,

The dearth of evidence on the personal utility of incidental findings has hampered clinical guidelines. Our goal was to estimate the personal utility of complex information derived from incidental genomic findings. METHODS: We used a discrete-choice experiment to assess participants' self-utility for the following attributes: disease penetrance, disease treatability, disease severity, carrier status, and cost. The study participants were drawn from the Canadian public. We analyze the data with a mixed logit model. RESULTS: In total, 1200 participants completed our questionnaire (available in English and French). Participants valued receiving information about high penetrance disorders but expressed disutility about receiving information about low penetrance disorders. Median willingness to pay was $445 (95% confidence interval [CI] $322 to $567) to receive incidental findings in a scenario where clinicians returned information on high-penetrance medically treatable disorders, but only 66% of participants (95% CI 63%-71%) indicated that they would choose to receive information in that scenario. On average, participants placed significant value ($725, 95% CI: $600-$850) on having a choice about what type of findings they would receive, including receiving information about high-penetrance treatable disorders or receiving information on high penetrance. disorders with or without available treatment. The predicted acceptance of that scenario was 76% (95% CI: 72%-79%). INTERPRETATION: Most participants valued receiving incidental findings, but personal utility depended on the type of finding, and not all participants wanted to receive incidental findings, regardless of potential health implications. These results indicate that to maximize benefit, participant-level preferences should inform the decision about whether to return incidental findings.",0,0,

The HIV/AIDS epidemic has focused attention on the reproductive behavior of men. Sexual activity varies by racial/ethnic group. Interventions for delayed sexual initiation should be examined, although condom use has increased among 17-19 year olds from 21% to 58% in metropolitan areas. However, condom use is lowest among the group of men most at risk for STDs: those who have ever used drugs, those who have ever had sex with a prostitute, and those who had 5 or more partners per year. Male beliefs about contraception have been infrequently examined. There are misconceptions about heterosexual transmission of HIV. Better screening is needed for STD detection. Fathers are more involved in prenatal care and postnatal intervention programs. 7% of children have been the object of involuntary sexual relations between the ages of 18 and 21. ;"" that is, 12.7% white women, 9% black women, 1.9% white men, and 6.1% black men.

1661,"Socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, and mortality: results of a nationally representative prospective study of American adults.","Context.Âª A prominent hypothesis regarding social inequalities in mortality is that the elevated risk among the socioeconomically disadvantaged is largely due to the higher prevalence of health risk behaviors among those with lower levels of education and income. Lower. Objective.Â¡Âª To investigate the extent to which 4 behavioral risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, sedentary lifestyle, and relative body weight) explain the observed association between socioeconomic characteristics and all-cause mortality. Design. Longitudinal survey study investigating the impact of education, income, and health behaviors on the risk of dying in the next 7.5 years. Participants. A nationally representative sample of 3,617 adult women and men participating in the Americans' Changing Lives survey. Main outcome measure. All-cause mortality verified through the National Death Index and death certificate reviews. Results. Educational differences in mortality are fully explained by the strong association between education and income. Controlling for age, sex, race, urbanity, and education, the mortality hazard ratio was 3.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-5.16) for those in the lower income and 2.34 (95% CI, 1.49 -3.67) for those in the middle income group. When health risk behaviors were considered, the risk of dying was still significantly elevated for the lowest income group (hazard ratio, 2.77""; 95% CI, 1.74-4.42 ) and the middle-income group (hazard rate ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.38-3.25).Â¡Âª Although reducing the prevalence of health risk behaviors in populations of low income is an important public health goal, socioeconomic differences in mortality are due to a broader range of factors and thus would persist even with better health behaviors among those harmed.",0,0,
1662,Sources of variation and bias in diagnostic accuracy studies,"Background: Diagnostic accuracy studies are subject to different sources of bias and variation than studies evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention. Little is known about the effects of these sources of bias and variation. Purpose: To summarize the evidence on the factors that can generate bias or variation in the results of diagnostic accuracy studies. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS, and the methodological databases of the Center for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration. Expert methodologists in diagnostic tests were contacted. Study selection: Studies that investigated the effects of bias and variation in measures of test performance were eligible for inclusion, which was assessed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis: The best-documented effects of bias and variation were found for demographics, disease prevalence and severity, partial verification bias, clinical review bias, and observer and instrument variation. For other sources, such as biased participant selection, missing or inappropriate reference standard, differential verification bias, and review bias, the amount of evidence was limited. Evidence was lacking for other features, including recruitment bias, treatment paradox, arbitrary choice of threshold value, and dropouts.

METHODS: A 19-item questionnaire was mailed to participants in a large genome research consortium 18 months after a baseline survey. We describe the stability of parents' attitudes toward (a) sharing genomic research results, (b) children's support of genomic research, (c) researchers' responsibilities, and (d) responsibilities to the community. extended family. We also explore your experience in receiving results. RESULTS: Of 170 original participants, 154 (91%) responded. Most participants expressed positive rights to receive incidental genomic research findings (85%), even when enhancement therapy was unknown (85%). Only 3% considered it acceptable to delegate the decision to return the results to an independent committee. Researchers, either with a parent (42%) or a doctor (17%), were held responsible for passing on research results to children when they reach adulthood. The majority of participants (74%) indicated that the results should be shared with the potentially affected extended family. These results are very similar to those of the reference survey. All participants who received genomic results would do so again and reported actions similar to their expressed attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' opinions regarding genomic research remain stable over time. Guidelines on return of results should incorporate these findings.",0,0,

We present data from a prospective quality control study of the effect on behavior of prehospital intensive care anesthesiologists of implementing a standard operating procedure for prehospital controlled ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthesiologists from eight prehospital intensive care teams in the central region of Denmark prospectively recorded prehospital advanced airway management data according to the Utstein-style template. We collected pre-intervention data from February 1, 2011 through January 31, 2012, implemented standard operating procedure on February 1, 2012, and collected post-intervention data from February 1, 2012 through January 31, 2012. October 2012. We included transported patients of all ages requiring controlled ventilation treated with prehospital endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway device insertion. The objective was to assess whether the development and implementation of a standard operating procedure for controlled ventilation during transport could change the behavior of prehospital critical care anesthesiologists and thus increase the use of automated ventilators in these patients. RESULTS: Implementation of a standard operating procedure increased the overall prevalence of automated ventilator use in transported patients requiring controlled ventilation from 0.40 (0.34-0.47) to 0.74 (0.69-0.80). ) with a prevalence ratio of 1.85 (1.57-2.19) (p = 0.00).

1669,Meet Minimum Standards: Implement Antibiotic Stewardship in Intensive Care,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, antimicrobial stewardship programs are a mandatory component of hospital accreditation. Good antimicrobial prescribing documentation aids communication and can improve prescribing practice in settings with multiple decision makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and implement an intervention to improve antimicrobial prescribing practice in a 24-bed intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital for adults. METHODS: We conducted a prospective collaborative study of quality improvement before and after four phases (observation, reflection, implementation, evaluation). Baseline audits and surveys of antimicrobial prescribing practices identified barriers to and facilitators of good prescribing practices. A tailored intervention was then implemented for 6 weeks and included a yellow sticker on the medication record, quarterly educational sessions, and empirical intensive care unit-specific antimicrobial prescribing guidelines. After implementation, effects were monitored by serial antimicrobial prescription audits for 1 year. Primary outcomes were clear documentation of start date, planned end date or review date, and indication of an antibiotic. All of these were considered the ""minimum standards"" for an antimicrobial prescription in the drug registry. RESULTS: Documentation of the minimum standards specifically addressed by the label (start date (72% to 90%, P < 0.001), end date (16% to 63%, P < 0.001), documented antimicrobial indication in the medication table (58% to 83%, P < 0.01). Overall, compliance with the three minimum standards (start date, end date, and indication) improved from 41/306 (13%) to 306/492 (63%) (P < .001). One year after implementation, the yellow tag had been integrated into daily practice.

1670,stimulant drugs,"Stimulants are a key element in the treatment of ADHD. Carefully designed stimulant trials have found substantial improvement in core ADHD behaviors in 65-75% of ADHD subjects. Most standard stimulants are rapidly absorbed, with their behavioral effects appearing within 30 minutes, peaking in one to three hours, and wearing off within five hours. Doses at school are often necessary, despite the risk of teasing from peers and the additional requirements of adult supervision. The mechanism by which stimulants act to reduce hyperactivity is not fully understood, but they do improve impulsivity and activity levels. Several controlled evaluations carried out over periods of time greater than one year show a clear persistence of the effects of the medication over time. A carefully crafted program of methylphenidate treatment is more effective in reducing symptoms of hyperactivity than an intensive program of behavioral and cognitive intervention. The combination of stimulants with psychosocial interventions in ADHD offers few advantages over medication alone. It is difficult to propose unquestionable guidelines for practice that would be appropriate everywhere. It is imperative that physicians who prescribe stimulants supervise the use of the drug appropriately, ensuring that the child's family, peers, or those administering the medication at school do not abuse it. Polypharmacy should only be started by a specialized service and the combination of methylphenidate and clonidine should be used with caution. Aside from ADHD, stimulants are useful in narcolepsy, resistant depression, and partial attention-hyperactivity syndromes. Significant gaps in knowledge remain"";"" the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of the stimulant effects need further study. The details of the stimulant administration regimens appear to have an important effect on the response achieved.

1672,Strategies for rehabilitation professionals to put evidence-based knowledge into practice: a systematic review,"RATIONALE: Rehabilitation clinicians need to stay current on best practices, especially since adhering to clinical guidelines can significantly improve patient outcomes. However, little is known about the benefits of knowledge translation interventions for these professionals. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of single- and multi-component knowledge translation interventions in improving the practical knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of rehabilitation clinicians. METHODS: Systematic review of 7 databases conducted to identify studies evaluating specific knowledge translation interventions for occupational therapists and physical therapists. RESULTS: 12 studies met the eligibility criteria. For physical therapists, participation in a multi-component active knowledge translation intervention resulted in better evidence-based knowledge and practice behaviors compared to passive dissemination strategies. These achievements did not translate into changes in physicians' attitudes toward best practice. For occupational therapists, no studies have examined the use of multi-component interventions"";"" studies of single interventions suggest limited evidence of effectiveness for all outcomes measured. CONCLUSION: While this review suggests the use of multicomponent active knowledge translation interventions to improve physical therapists' knowledge and practice behaviors, further research is needed to understand the impact of these strategies on occupational therapists.

1674,Strengthening of the Report on Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE): Explanation and Elaboration,"Much of medical research is observational. Reporting of observational studies is often of poor quality. Poor reporting makes it difficult to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a study and to generalize its results. Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening Observational Study Reporting in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality of observational study reporting. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of the articles. Eighteen elements are common to cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies, and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors on how to improve observational study reporting and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors, and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to improve the use, understanding and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item is presented. For each item, one or more published examples are provided and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. Examples of useful flow charts are also included.

Stress can cause myocardial ischemia, rhythm disturbances, platelet stimulation, increased blood viscosity due to hemoconcentration, as well as endothelial dysfunction and coronary vasoconstriction in the presence of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Psychosocial risk factors can also lead to the development and clinical consequences of arteriosclerosis. The five most important psychosocial risk factors are: depression, anxiety, personality factors, social isolation and chronic life stress. Various components are responsible for the fact that life events or certain psychosocial factors can lead to a stress reaction.

1676,Stress echocardiography in heart failure,"Echocardiography has the ability to noninvasively explore hemodynamic variables during pharmacological or exercise stress testing in patients with heart failure. In this review, we detail some important potential applications of stress echocardiography in patients with heart failure. In patients with coronary artery disease and chronic LV dysfunction, dobutamine stress echocardiography is able to distinguish between viable and fibrotic tissue to make appropriate clinical decisions. The stress test, in combination with echocardiographic monitoring, is a method to obtain accurate information in the evaluation of functional capacity and prognosis. Functional mitral regurgitation is a common finding in patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy, and stress echocardiography in the form of exercise or pharmacological protocols can be useful in evaluating the behavior of mitral regurgitation. It is of clinical utility to search for the presence of contractile reserve in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy as well as to screen for or monitor the presence of latent myocardial dysfunction in patients who have been exposed to cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, in patients with suspected diastolic heart failure and normal systolic function, stress echocardiography could demonstrate the existence of such dysfunction and determine that it is sufficient to limit exercise tolerance. Finally, in aortic stenosis, dobutamine echocardiography can distinguish severe from non-severe stenosis in patients with low transvalvular gradients and depressed left ventricular function.",0,0,
1677,Structured follow-up by general practitioners after deliberate self-poisoning: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the follow-up of patients after deliberate self-poisoning (DSP). The objective was to examine whether structured follow-up by GPs increased content, adherence and satisfaction with treatment after discharge from the emergency department. METHODS: This was a multicenter randomized trial with blinded allocation. Five emergency services and general practices in the area of influence participated. 202 patients discharged from emergency departments after DSP were assigned. The intervention consisted of a structured follow-up by the general practitioner for a period of 6 months with a minimum of five consultations, accompanied by a written guide for general practitioners with suggestions to motivate patients to follow the treatment, assess personal problems and suicidal ideation and availability in the event of a suicidal crisis. Outcome measures were data extracted from the Register for the Control and Payment of Reimbursement to Health Service Providers (KUHR) and through questionnaires mailed to patients and GPs. After 3 and 6 months, the frequency and content of GP contact and adherence to GP consultations and treatment in general were recorded. Satisfaction with the general treatment received and with the GP was measured using the EUROPEP scale. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group received significantly more consultations than the control group (mean 6.7 vs. 4.5 (p = 0.004)). The intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the time their GP spent listening to their personal problems (93.1% vs 59.4% (p=0.002)) and with the fact that the GP included in medical decisions (87.5% vs. 54.8% (p = 0.009)). The intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the treatment in general than the control group (79% vs. 51% (p = 0.026)). CONCLUSIONS: Structured and improved GP guidelines and follow-up after DSP patient discharge increased the number of consultations and satisfaction with aftercare in general practice. Consistent with previous research, there is still a need for intervention studies. TRIAL REGISTRY: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01342809. Registered on April 18, 2011.",0,0,
1678,Structured smoking cessation training for health professionals in cardiology wards: a prospective study,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is a major cardiovascular risk factor, and smoking cessation is imperative for patients hospitalized with a cardiovascular event. This study aimed to evaluate a systems-based approach to help hospitalized smokers quit and identify implementation barriers. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study followed by qualitative analysis of staff interviews. METHODS: The prospective intervention study evaluated the effects of implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the provision of counseling and pharmacotherapy to smokers admitted to cardiology wards on the frequency of counseling. In addition, a qualitative analysis of staff interviews was conducted to examine the determinants of physician and nurse behavior"";"" this sought to understand the barriers in terms of motivation, ability and/or opportunity. RESULTS: A total of 150 smoker patients were included in the study (75 before and 75 after SOP implementation). Before the implementation of the SOPs, the proportion of patients who reported receiving smoking cessation advice from doctors and nurses was 6.7% and 1.3%, respectively. After SOP implementation, these proportions increased to 38.7% (p < 0.001) and 2.7% (p = 0.56), respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed that lack of motivation, for example role incongruity, appeared to be a major barrier. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a set of standard operating procedures for smoking cessation counseling was effective with physicians but not with nurses. The analysis of barriers to implementation highlighted lack of motivation rather than capacity or opportunity as an important factor that should be addressed.",0,1,
1679,Study confirms value of STD treatment in curbing HIV transmission,"PIP: An intervention was carried out in the Mwanza region of Tanzania to determine whether improved treatment at health centers and rural clinics of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) other than HIV/AIDS could reduce the incidence of new HIV/AIDS infections. The hiv. Physician assistants and nurses at six rural health centers were trained in syndromic management of STDs, and health center staff were encouraged to counsel their patients, offer them condoms, and request referrals from sexual partners for treatment. The centers received the least expensive effective drugs for the treatment of the main STD syndromes. Health workers trained as supervisors visited each center every 8 weeks to check drug supplies and patient records, provide refresher training, and ensure adherence to syndromic management guidelines. In addition, a cohort of 1,000 adults in the communities served by the six health centers were interviewed and tested for HIV at the start of the study and 2 years after the intervention was introduced. The number of new cases of HIV infection that occurred in the cohort was then compared with those that occurred in another selected cohort of communities served by health centers where improved STD treatment had not been provided. 11,632 STD cases were treated at the centers during the 2-year study period. The intervention was found to reduce the number of new HIV infections that occurred during the study period by 42%. That reduction was in both sexes and in all age groups, but was especially evident among women aged 15 to 24 years. The survey results indicate that the reductions in HIV incidence were the result of better STD treatment rather than changes in sexual behavior. Preliminary calculations indicate a cost of approximately US$300 per HIV infection averted.",0,0,
1680,Study of a novel curriculum on electronic communication in family medicine residencies,"Electronic communication between doctors and patients is common, but it can carry risks for users, both patients and doctors. Little is known about electronic communication between physicians and patients, and even less about electronic communication during residency. We studied knowledge and practices before and after a controlled trial of a novel curriculum teaching email communication with patients using residents and faculty at 16 family medicine residencies in the United States. Both teaching staff and residents showed a lack of knowledge about confidentiality and encryption, unfamiliarity with published guidelines for doctor-patient email, and noncompliance with documentation requirements before the curriculum was presented. Post-testing revealed greater improvement in knowledge and appropriate behaviors related to doctor-patient email in the intervention group compared to control sites (mean intervention increase of 13 points [t = -4.065 , P < 0.01], mean increase in control is 5 points [t=-2.015, p<0.05]). Greater uncertainty about comfort with patient email among intervention residents is an interesting finding that could be due to increased awareness of issues but limited time spent absorbing the topic. Suggestions for delivering the curriculum are provided.",0,0,
1681,Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial: the feasibility and impact of absolute cardiovascular risk assessment in Australian general practice.,"BACKGROUND: Although absolute cardiovascular risk assessment (CVAR) has been recommended for use in Australian general practice for a number of years, there is continuing uncertainty about its implementation and impact. Our previous work has developed a multifaceted implementation model. This study aims to investigate both the feasibility of using this model and the impact of CVAR assessment and management on general practice clinical processes and patient care. STUDY DESIGN: This cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in general practices in Sydney, involving general practitioners (GPs), other practice staff, and patients aged 45 to 69 years without existing cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A total of 32 practices (40 physicians) and 1,320 patients will be recruited. Randomization will be carried out at the practice level. The intervention group of GPs will be trained to use a CVAR implementation model, while the control group of GPs will continue with usual care. Study outcomes include clinical processes, patient risk, use of lifestyle interventions, and prescription of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. Data will be collected and analyzed using mixed methods. Study results before and after the intervention will be compared, and the 2 groups will also be compared after adjusting for baseline difference and grouping factors. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first study in Australian general practice and one of the few international studies to assess the impact of implementing CVAR assessment and management. The results of this study will help improve primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and inform guidelines for clinical practice and the implementation of other health initiatives.",0,0,
1682,Studying deimplementation in health: an analysis of funded research grants,"Background The study of the lack of implementation, defined in this document as the reduction or cessation of the use of a health service or practice provided to patients by health care professionals and systems, has gained strength in recent years. years. Eliminating ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or low-value health services and practices is important to mitigate patient harm, improve care processes, and reduce health care costs. A better understanding of the state of the science is needed to guide future goals and funding initiatives. To this end, we characterized deimplementation research grants funded by the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Methods We used systematic methods to search for, identify, and describe deimplementation research grants funded at the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) and AHRQ from fiscal year 2000 through 2017. Eleven key terms and three funding opportunity announcements were used to search for research grants in the NIH Query, View and Report (QVR) system. Two coders identified eligible grants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A codebook was developed, pilot tested and reviewed before the final sample full grant applications were coded. Results A total of 1,277 grants were identified through the QVR"";"" system. 542 remained after removing duplicates. After the multi-step eligibility screening and review process, 20 grant applications were coded. Many grants were funded by NIH (n?=?15), with fewer funded by AHRQ, and most were funded between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (n?=?11). Grant proposals focused on the elimination of a variety of health practices and services (eg, drugs, therapies, screening tests) in various health areas (eg, cancer, cardiovascular disease) and settings. provision (eg, hospitals, nursing homes, schools). The grants proposed to use a variety of study designs and research methods (eg, experimental, observational, mixed methods) to achieve the objectives of the study. Conclusions Based on systematic review of the portfolio of NIH and AHRQ-funded research grants over the past 17 years, relatively few have focused on studying the lack of implementation of ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused health programs. , inappropriate and/or of low value. services and practices provided to patients by health professionals and systems.

1683,Success after treatment of periprosthetic joint infection: a Delphi-based international multidisciplinary consensus,"BACKGROUND: The lack of agreement regarding what constitutes successful treatment for periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) makes it difficult to compare different management strategies used in clinical practice and in research studies. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The goals of this study were to create a consensus definition for success after PJI treatment and to provide a universal, multidimensional framework for informing PJI treatment studies. METHODS: A basic two-round Delphi method was used to arrive at a consensus definition. We invited 159 international experts (orthopedic surgeons, infectious disease specialists, and clinical researchers) from 17 countries to participate; 59 participated in the first round and 42 participated in the second round. The final definition consisted of all statements that achieved strong agreement. (80% or more of participants considering a relevant criterion to define success) RESULTS: The consensus definition of a successfully treated PJI is: (1) eradication of infection, characterized by a healed wound without fistula, drainage, or pain , and no recurrent infection caused by the same strain of the organism; (2) no subsequent surgical intervention for infection after replantation surgery;"" and (3) no PJI-related mortality (from causes such as sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis). The Delphi panel agreed to define mid-term outcomes as reported 5 or more years after definitive PJI surgery, and long-term outcomes as reported 10 or more years after surgery Although no consensus was reached on the definition of short-term outcomes, 71% of participants agreed that 2 years after definitive PJI surgery is acceptable to define PJI.CONCLUSIONS: This multidimensional definition of success after PJI treatment can be used to report and compare treatment outcomes for this catastrophic complication LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, Therapeutic Study See Guidelines to Authors for a full description of levels of evidence.",0,0,
1684,"Successful implementation of a guideline through peer comparisons, education, and positive feedback from clinicians","The objective of this study was to determine if peer comparisons, an educational intervention, and positive feedback from clinicians would decrease the ordering of knee X-ray studies. We prospectively studied the ordering of knee X-ray studies for patients presenting with knee injuries before and after an educational program to encourage the use of the Ottawa decision rule for knee radiography. Physicians were able to privately compare their individual baseline X-ray utilization data with that of their colleagues. Although acceptance of the rule was voluntary, both oral and written feedback encouraged consideration of the rule in clinical decision making. The percentage of patients with knee injuries who received X-ray studies, as well as the percentage of abnormal results (PAR, defined as the percentage of X-ray studies showing a fracture or effusion), were calculated before and after the meeting. educational. The results of the study showed that the percentage of patients with knee injuries who received X-ray studies decreased by 23%. Furthermore, PAR increased 58.4% between the two study periods. In conclusion, the physician's behavior can be positively modified by reinforcement. Peer comparisons, education, and positive feedback from physicians reduced physician testing even without the mandatory use of a protocol. PAR is a useful outcome measure for tracking physician utilization.",0,1,
1685,Successful implementation of a sedation and neonatal pain protocol in 2 NICUs,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a sedation and neonatal pain protocol in 2 ICUs. METHODS: The intervention began with an assessment of local practice, problems, and staff satisfaction. We then developed and implemented the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. The protocol included well-defined strategies for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions based on periodic assessment of a translated version of the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale and titration of sedative and analgesic therapy according to target scores. Health care staff were trained in the assessment using a video-based tutorial and bedside teaching. In addition, we conduct re-evaluation, training and random quality checks. The frequency and quality of assessments, drug therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and outcome were compared between baseline (12 months before implementation) and 12 months after implementation. RESULTS: Cumulative median (interquartile range) opioid dose (initial dose of 1.4 [0.5-5.9] mg/kg versus intervention group dose of 2.7 [0.4-57] mg /kg morphine equivalents""; P = 0.002), pharmacological interventions per episode of continuous sedation/analgesia (4 [2-10] vs 6 [2-13]; P = 0.005), and overall staff satisfaction (physicians : 31% vs. 89%; p < 0.001; nurses: 17% vs. 55%;"" p < 0.001) increased after implementation. Time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and adverse outcomes were similar before and after implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a neonatal pain and sedation protocol in 2 ICUs resulted in an increase in opioid prescription, pharmacological interventions, and staff satisfaction without affecting time on mechanical ventilation, length of stay in intensive care and adverse outcomes.",0,0,
1686,Successful reduction of catheter-associated urinary tract infections: focus on nurse-led catheter removal.,"Background Despite using sterile technique for catheter insertion, closed drainage systems, and structured daily care plans, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CUTs) occur regularly in acute care hospitals. We believe that a significant reduction in CAUTI rates can only be achieved by reducing the use of urinary catheters. Methods We used a hospital-wide multidisciplinary program intervention study to reduce the use of urinary catheters and CAUTIs in all patient care units at a 300-bed community teaching hospital in Connecticut. Our primary focus was the implementation of a nurse-led urinary catheter removal protocol. This protocol was linked to the physician's order of catheter insertion. Three additional items included physician documentation of catheter insertion criteria, a device-specific charting module added to electronic physician progress notes, and biweekly unit-specific feedback on catheter use rates and rates of discharge. CAUTI in a multidisciplinary forum. Results We achieved a hospital-wide 50% reduction in catheter use and a 70% reduction in CAUTI over a 36-month period, although there was wide unit-to-unit variation in catheter reduction efforts, which they range from 4% (maternity) to 74%. % (telemetry). Conclusion Urinary catheter use, and ultimately CAUTI rates, can be effectively reduced by diligent application of relatively few evidence-based interventions. Aggressive implementation of the nurse-led catheter removal protocol was associated with lower rates of catheter use and reduced infection rates.",0,1,
1687,Suicidal tendency: procedure in emergency cases,"Emergency physicians (EP), paramedics and emergency personnel play an increasingly important role in the emergency medical and psychological treatment of patients after suicide attempts, as well as in crisis intervention of people with acute suicidal tendencies. . This article aims to give an overview of the prevalence rates, the methods of suicide or attempted suicide, and the problems faced by EPs in the treatment of these patients. In addition, concepts are presented that allow an adequate evaluation of the risk of suicidality and the options of primary intervention in crisis. Paramedics and critical care physicians are increasingly dealing with this complex process with social, personal and medical aspects. To treat people in suicidal crisis and/or after a suicide attempt and to provide safe and optimal care for this often heterogeneous patient group, clear guidelines are a prerequisite. The first assessment of the acute danger of suicide is of particular importance because of the resulting consequences and demonstrates a clear approach to dealing with suicidal people. In addition, the legal principles are presented.",0,0,
1688,Evaluation of suicide and violence in psychiatry,"Psychiatrists are increasingly expected to predict and prevent suicidal and violent/homicidal impulses in their clients. This article reviews the literature and current research in these areas. While the debate continues as to whether clinicians can successfully predict violence or suicidal behavior in their patients, the preponderance of studies weighs that predicting suicide and violence in the individual may not be possible at present given current knowledge. . To compensate for prognostic limitations, conservative physicians deliberately predict suicide or violence to help ensure the safety of their patients and the larger communities in which they reside. In addition, clinicians must conduct thorough evaluations and make sound clinical decisions that are in line with perceived risks. Preventive measures for violence remain complex, but clinicians can maximize the effects of treatment by following specific intervention guidelines. At a minimum, documentation of violence should focus on the rationale for why treatment interventions were or were not implemented. The chart does not require extensive annotations, but should include a reasonable assessment of risk and the delineation of a prudent course of action.",0,0,

This randomized controlled trial examined the use of a wirelessly networked mobile computer (MC) by physicians at the bedside with access to an emergency department information system, decision support tools (DST), and other management options. software. Methods: Each of the 10 volunteer ER physicians was randomized using a matched-pair design to work five shifts in a standard manner (access to a desktop computer [DC]) and five shifts with a CM on a wireless network. Work pattern problems and use of electronic CPG/DST were compared using end-of-shift satisfaction questionnaires and review of a CPG/DST database. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine differences between shifts. Results: A total of 100 eight-hour shifts"" were evaluated; 99% compliance with post-shift questionnaires was achieved. Using a seven-point Likert scale (MC values first), MCs were rated as as fast (5.04 vs. 4.54; p = 0.13) and convenient (5.08 vs. 4.14; p = 0.07) as DC In general, physicians rated CMs as less efficient (3.18 vs. 4.30; p = 0.02), but recommended more frequent use of DSTs (4.10 vs. 3.47; p = 0.03) without affecting doctor-patient communication (2.78 vs. 2.96, p = 0.51) During the study period, physicians' use of an intranet web application (eCPG) was more frequent during shifts assigned to the CM compared to the CD (eCPG uses/turn, 3.6 vs. 2.0;"" p = 0.033). Conclusions: MC technology enabled clinicians to access information at the bedside and increased the use of CPG/DST tools. According to the doctors, the patients seemed to accept the use of information technology to help in decision-making. The development of improved computing technology may address the main limitation of MC portability.",0,1,
1691,Support for initiation of insulin in type 2 diabetes in primary care: results from the Stepping Up pragmatic cluster randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Objective: To compare the efficacy of a new model of care (""Stepping Up"") with usual primary care in normalizing insulin initiation for type 2 diabetes, leading to improved levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting Primary care practice in Victoria, Australia, with a practice nurse and at least one consenting eligible patient (HbA1c Ã¢â€°Â¥7.5% with maximum oral therapy). Participants 266 patients with type 2 diabetes and 74 practices (mean cluster size 4 (range 1-8) patients), followed up for 12 months. Intervention The Stepping Up model of care intervention involved theory-based change in practice systems and reorientation of the roles of health professionals in the primary care diabetes team Core components were an enhanced role for the nurse of practice in directing insulin initiation and mentoring by a registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials. Main Outcome Measures The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who transitioned to insulin, the proportion who reached target HbA1c, and a change in depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9), diabetes-specific distress (problem areas on the diabetes scale, PAID) and generic health. (assessment of the quality of life instrument, AQoL-8D). Results: HbA1c improved in both arms, with a clinically significant difference between arms (mean difference -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -0.9% to -0.3%). favoring the intervention. At 12 months, in the intervention practices, 105/151 (70%) of the participants had started insulin, compared to 25/115 (22%) in the control practices (odds ratio 8.3, interval 95% confidence 4.5 to 15.4, P<0.001). The HbA1c goal (Ã¢â€°Â¤7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%) intervention participants and 22 (19%) control participants (odds ratio 2.2, 1 .2 to 4.3, P=0.02). Depressive symptoms did not worsen at 12 months (PHQ-9: -1.1 (3.5) v -0.1 (2.9), P=0.05). A statistically significant difference was found between arms in mean change in mental health (mental component summary AQoL: 0.04 (SD 0.16) v -0.002 (0.13), mean difference 0.04 (95% confidence interval 0.002 to 0.08), P=0.04), in favor of the intervention, but there was no significant difference in physical health (physical component summary AQoL: 0.03 (0.15) v 0, 02 (0.13)) nor diabetes-specific distress (5.6 (15.5) v -2.4 (15.4)). No events of severe hypoglycemia were reported.

1692,Supporting mid-level health workers in Malawi: lessons learned during the implementation of the PALM PLUS package,"BACKGROUND: The Government of Malawi is committed to the broad implementation of antiretroviral treatment in Malawi in the public health sector"";"" however, one of the main challenges has been the shortage of trained health workers. The Practical Approach to Lung Health Plus HIV/AIDS in Malawi (PALM PLUS) package is an innovative guideline and training intervention that supports mid-tier primary care health care workers to deliver frontline integrated primary care. The purpose of this document is to describe the lessons learned in the implementation of the PALM PLUS package. METHODS: An algorithm- and symptom-based guideline-based clinical tool was adapted to the Malawian context. A complementary training program was developed based on educational outreach principles and a cascade training approach was used for the implementation of the PALM PLUS package in 30 health centers, targeting clinical officers, physician assistants, and nurses. Lessons learned were identified during program implementation through engagement with collaborating partners and program participants and review of program evaluation results. RESULTS: Key lessons learned for the successful implementation of the PALM PLUS package include the importance of building networks for peer support, ensuring adequate training capacity, linking to continuing professional development accreditation, and providing modest budgets for on-site training. service. The main limiting factors for implementation were staff turnover and the desire for financial allocations for training. CONCLUSIONS: The PALM PLUS approach is a potential model for supporting mid-level health workers to provide frontline integrated primary care in low- and middle-income countries, and may be useful for future task-shift initiatives.",0,0,
1693,Surgical decision making and behavior. Explanations of social psychology and research perspectives.,"Social psychology is the discipline that investigates thought processes, emotions, and behaviors in the interpersonal context. There are three broad thematic domains: understanding oneself and other people, interpersonal relationships, and group influence. The most important method is the experiment. The value of the social psychological perspective is illustrated with respect to the following surgical research questions: How do surgeons arrive at their decisions? How do surgeons confirm their decisions? Why are decision aids (computer support, guidelines) so poorly accepted? How should patients be informed? What group processes play a role in the operating room? What are the determinants of patient outcomes? Social psychology can extend surgical research in three ways: a better understanding of everyday phenomena in clinical and surgical settings, methodologically refined and more robust patient-oriented study designs, and new perspectives to improve patient outcomes.",0,0,

DESIGN Care pathways describing credible treatment strategies were decided by consensus. The cost-utility analysis used Markov models and Monte Carlo simulation. DATA SOURCES Clinical effectiveness data come from a systematic review and an individual level dataset. The utility values come from previous economic evaluations. Costs were calculated from the National Health Service (NHS) and commercial sources. METHODS The Markov model included parameters with associated measures of uncertainty that described the health states between which individuals could move in three-month intervals over 10 years. Successive annual cohorts of 25,000 men were entered into the model, and the likelihood of treatment strategies being cost-effective was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations. RESULTS A treatment strategy of initial diathermic vaporisation of the prostate followed by endoscopic holmium laser enucleation of the prostate in case of subsequent failure or relapse had an 85% chance of being cost effective at a willingness to pay value of £20,000 (21 euros). ,595, $28,686)/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Other strategies with diathermy vaporization as initial treatment were generally cheaper and more effective than the current standard of transurethral resection repeated once if necessary. The use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporization incurred higher costs and was less effective than transurethral resection, and strategies involving minimally invasive initial treatment with microwave thermotherapy were not cost-effective. Findings did not change in wide range sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION The result of this economic model should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the data used. The finding that initial vaporization followed by holmium laser enucleation for failure or relapse might be advantageous for both men with lower urinary tract symptoms and health care providers requires confirmation in a good-quality prospective clinical trial before any changes in current practice. Laser vaporization of potassium titanyl phosphate is unlikely to be cost-effective in our model, which argues against its unrestricted use until more evidence of effectiveness and cost reduction is obtained.",0,0,

(It is beyond the scope of this document to consider ethical issues related to the research participation of children with cognitive impairments or children or adults with intermittent and/or reversible cognitive or psychiatric impairments. For such discussions, see the references in the notes 1–6.) Reviewing such studies stretches our traditional analysis tools to their limits.

We evaluated whether a single brief lifestyle consultation as part of a larger survivorship care plan was effective in changing diet and lifestyle patterns. METHODS: A diverse sample of women with stage 0-III breast cancer was randomly assigned to control or intervention groups within 6 weeks of completion of adjuvant treatment. Both groups received the National Cancer Institute publication, ""Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment."" The intervention group also met with a nurse (1h) and a nutritionist (1h) to receive personalized lifestyle recommendations based on national guidelines. Diet, lifestyle, and perceived health were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Linear regression analyzes evaluated intervention effects adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 126 women completed the study (60 control/66 intervention, 61 Hispanic/65 non-Hispanic). At 3 months, the intervention group reported greater knowledge of a healthy diet (P = 0.047), the importance of physical activity (P = 0.03), and the appropriate use of dietary supplements (P = 0.006) and reported a lower frequency of alcohol consumption (P = 0.006). = 0.03) than controls. At 6 months, only greater knowledge about healthy eating persisted (p = 0.01). The intervention was more effective among non-Hispanics than among Hispanics in improving attitudes toward healthy eating (P = 0.03) and frequency of physical activity (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention changed lifestyle behaviors and knowledge in the short term, but the benefits did not persist.

Health care providers and their obese patients know little about these programs due to the absence of systematic reviews. Purpose: To describe the components, costs, and effectiveness of the major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States that provide structured counseling in person or online. Data sources: review of company websites, telephone conversation with company representatives, and search of the MEDLINE database. Study Selection: Randomized trials of at least 12 weeks' duration that enrolled adults only and evaluated interventions as generally provided to the public, or case series that met these criteria, indicated the number enrolled, and included an evaluation of follow-up lasting 1 year or more. Data Extraction: Data on study design, attrition, weight loss, duration of follow-up, and maintenance of weight loss were extracted. Data Synthesis: We found studies from eDiets.com, Health Management Resources, Take Off Pounds Sensible, OPTIFAST, and Weight Watchers. Of 3 randomized controlled trials of Weight Watchers, the largest reported a 3.2% loss of baseline weight at 2 years. A randomized trial and multiple case series of medically supervised very-low-calorie diet programs found that patients who completed treatment lost approximately 15% to 25% of their initial weight. These programs were associated with high costs, high dropout rates, and a high probability of regaining 50% or more of lost weight in 1 to 2 years. Commercial interventions available on the Internet and organized self-help programs produced minimal weight loss. Limitations: As many studies did not control for high attrition rates, the reported results are probably best case. Conclusions: With the exception of 1 Weight Watchers trial, the evidence to support the use of major commercial and self-help weight loss programs is suboptimal. Controlled trials are needed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these interventions.",0,0,
1699,Systematic review: elective induction of labor versus expectant management of pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: Rates of induction of labor and elective induction of labor are increasing. Whether elective induction of labor improves outcomes or simply leads to increased complications and healthcare costs is commonly debated in the literature. PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of elective induction of labor and expectant management of pregnancy. 2009), Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to March 2009), bibliographies of included studies, and previous systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Experimental and observational studies of elective induction of labor reported in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors summarized study design, patient characteristics, quality criteria, and outcomes, including cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Overall, expectant management of pregnancy was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) for cesarean delivery than elective labor induction (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1, 39]; absolute risk difference, 1.9 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 3.7 percentage points]) in 9 RCTs. Women at or greater than 41 completed weeks' gestation who were managed expectantly had an increased risk of cesarean delivery (OR, 1.21 [CI, 1.01 to 1.46]), but this difference was not statistically significant. in women less than 41 completed weeks' gestation (OR, 1.73 [CI, 0.67 to 4.5]). Women who were managed expectantly were more likely to have meconium-stained amniotic fluid than those who were induced electively (OR, 2.04 [CI, 1.34 to 3.09]). LIMITATIONS: There were no recent RCTs of elective induction of labor at less than 41 weeks' gestation. The 2 studies conducted at less than 41 weeks' gestation were of poor quality and were not generalizable to current practice. CONCLUSION: RCTs suggest that elective induction of labor at 41 weeks' gestation and beyond is associated with a decreased risk of cesarean delivery and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. There are concerns about the translation of these findings into actual practice; therefore, future studies should examine elective induction of labor in settings where most obstetric care is provided.",0,0,
1700,Systematic review: the long-term effects of false-positive mammograms.,"BACKGROUND: Although abnormal screening mammograms negatively affect women's psychological well-being during the time immediately following screening, their long-term effects are poorly understood. PURPOSE: To characterize the long-term effects of false-positive screening mammography on behavior and well-being in women aged 40 years and older. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies from MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases up to August 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were identified that examined the effects of false-positive screening mammography results routine screening on women's behavior, well-being, or beliefs. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently coded study characteristics, quality, and effect size. DATA SYNTHESIS: 23 eligible studies (n = 313,967) were identified. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that US women who received false-positive screening mammography results were more likely to return for routine screening than those who received normal results (hazard ratio, 1.07 [CI 95%, 1.02 to 1.12]). The effect was not statistically significant among European women (hazard ratio, 0.97 [CI, 0.93 to 1.01]), and Canadian women were less likely to return for routine screening due to false-positive results. (hazard ratio, 0.63 [CI, 0.50 to 1.01]). 0.80]). Women who received false-positive results performed breast self-exams more frequently and had higher, but not apparently pathologically elevated, levels of distress and anxiety, and thought more about breast cancer than those with normal results. LIMITATIONS: Correlational study designs, a small number of studies, lack of clinical validation for many measures, and possible heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Some women with false-positive mammography results may have differences in whether they return for mammography, frequency of breast self-exams, and anxiety levels compared to women with normal results. Future research should examine how false-positive mammography results affect other outcomes, such as trust and use of health care.",0,0,
1701,Systematic review: the value of periodic health assessment,"Background: Periodic health assessment (PHE) has been a fundamental part of medical practice for decades despite a lack of consensus about its value. Purpose: To synthesize the evidence on the benefits and harms of PHE. Data sources: Electronic searches of such databases as MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, review of reference lists, and journal handsearching up to September 2006. Study Selection: Studies (English only) evaluating the provision of preventive services , clinical outcomes, and costs among patients receiving PHE versus those receiving usual care. Data extraction: study design and settings, descriptions of the PHE, and clinical outcomes associated with the PHE. Data Synthesis: The best available evidence evaluating the benefits or harms of PHE consisted of 21 studies published between 1973 and 2004. PHE had a consistently beneficial association with patients receiving gynecological exams and Pap smears, cholesterol screening, and fecal occult blood tests. tinkling PHE also had a beneficial effect on patient 'concern' in 1 randomized controlled trial, but had mixed effects on other clinical outcomes and costs. Limitations: PHE descriptions and outcomes were heterogeneous. Some trials were conducted before the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were released, limiting their applicability to modern practice. Conclusions: The evidence suggests that PHE improves the provision of some recommended preventive services and may reduce patient concern. Although additional research is needed to clarify the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of receiving PHE, the evidence of benefit in this study warrants implementation of PHE in clinical practice.""",0,0,
1702,Systematic reviews are needed that examine the implementation of the research in practice and the impact on population health.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the focus of the research translation phase (T1-T4) of systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Briefly, T1 includes reviews of basic science experiments; T2 includes reviews of human trials leading to guideline development; T3 includes reviews examining how to translate the guidelines into policy and practice; and T4 includes reviews that describe the impact of changing health practices on population outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional audit of randomly selected reviews of CDSR (n = 500) and DARE (n = 500) was conducted. The translation phase of review research, overall and by subgroups of communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and injuries, was coded by two researchers. RESULTS: A total of 898 reviews examined a communicable, noncommunicable, or injury-related condition. Of these, 98% of reviews within CDSR focused on T2 and the remaining 2% focused on T3. In DARE, 88% focused on T2, 8.7% focused on T1, 2.5% focused on T3, and 1.3% focused on T4. Almost all reviews that examined communicable (CDSR 100%, DARE 93%), noncommunicable (CDSR 98%, DARE 87%), and lesions (CDSR 95%, DARE 88%) also focused on T2. CONCLUSION: Few reviews exist to guide practitioners and policymakers in implementing evidence-based treatments or programs.",0,0,

1704,Systems of Care for ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: An American Heart Association Mission Statement: Lifeline,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines require participation in systems to rapidly diagnose and treat ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In order to characterize currently deployed STEMI reperfusion systems and identify practices common to system organization, the American Heart Association surveyed existing systems in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: A STEMI system was defined as an integrated group of separate entities focused on reperfusion therapy for STEMI within a geographic region that included at least 1 hospital performing percutaneous coronary intervention and at least 1 emergency medical services agency. . Systems meeting this definition were invited to participate in a 42-question survey based on expert panel opinion and knowledge of existing systems. Data was collected through the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline website. Between April 2008 and January 2010, 381 unique systems involving 899 percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals in 47 states responded to the survey, of which 255 systems (67%) involved urban regions. The predominant funding sources for STEMI systems were percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals (n = 320, 84%) and/or cardiology practices (n = 88, 23%). Predominant system characteristics identified by the survey included: acceptance of STEMI patients into the percutaneous coronary intervention hospital regardless of bed availability (N = 346, 97%); activation of the cath lab with a single phone call (N = 335, 92%); emergency department physician lab activation without cardiology consultation (N = 318, 87%); participation in data recording (N = 311, 84%);"" and prehospital activation of the laboratory by notification to the emergency room without notification to cardiology (N = 297, 78%). The most common barriers to the implementation of the system were the hospital ( n = 139, 37%) and the proficiency of the cardiology group (n = 81, 21%) and emergency medical services, transportation, and finance (n = 99, 26%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey broadly describes the organizational characteristics collaborative efforts of hospitals and emergency medical services to provide timely reperfusion in the U.S. These findings serve as a benchmark for existing systems and should help guide health care teams in the process of reperfusion. organization of care for patients with STEMI.",0,0,
1705,Personalized information increases patient-doctor discussion about colon cancer risk and testing: the Cancer Risk Intake System trial,"To assess whether receiving personalized impressions generated by the Cancer Risk Intake System (CRIS), a touchscreen computer program that collects patient data and generates impressions for patients and physicians, results in resulted in more conversations between patients and providers about colorectal cancer (CRC). risk and screening than the receipt of non-adapted information.

1706,Personalized skills training for professionals to improve assessment of prognostic factors for persistent and disabling back pain: four quasi-experimental single-subject studies.,"The well-known gap between guidelines and behavior in clinical practice calls for effective behavior change interventions. An example showing this gap is the insufficient assessment by physical therapists of psychosocial prognostic factors in back pain (ie yellow flags). The present study aimed to evaluate an educational model by conducting a personalized skills training intervention for caregivers and studying changes over time in physiotherapists' assessment of prognostic factors in telephone consultations. A single-subject quasi-experimental design was used for 36 weeks, with repeated measurements during baseline, intervention, and post-intervention phases. Four primary health care physical therapists audio-recorded a total of 63 patient consultations. The personalized intervention included individual goal setting, skills training, and performance feedback. The primary outcome was the number of prognostic factors evaluated (0-10). Changes were observed in all four participants. The number of prognostic factors evaluated increased from 0 to 2 at baseline to 6 to 10 after the intervention. Time spent assessing psychosocial factors increased and time spent discussing biomedical pain symptoms decreased. Biopsychosocial knowledge and attitudes toward back pain were consistent with guidelines at enrollment and did not change markedly during the intervention. Self-efficacy for the evaluation of cognitive and emotional prognostic factors increased during the phases of the study. The results suggest that a personalized skills training intervention using behavior change techniques, such as individual goal setting, skills training, and performance feedback, is effective in producing changes in specific clinical behaviors in physical therapists.",0,1,
1707,Targeted intervention programs: creating a personalized practice model to improve the treatment of allergic rhinitis in a managed care population,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an intervention program to improve health outcomes among patients with allergic rhinitis in a managed care setting. STUDY DESIGN: The Lovelace Health Systems Episodes of Care (EOC) team selected allergic rhinitis for an intervention program because it was identified as one of the top 10 reasons for visits to primary care clinics. The intervention program was based on a multidisciplinary team process designed to create a personalized patient and provider education program to address inconsistency or deficiencies in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The EOC team investigated the literature and current practices and then identified inconsistencies in patterns of diagnosis and treatment. Based on this research, the team developed guidelines and a provider education program. Intervention strategies were structured around decision points in a treatment protocol. More than 500 patients were monitored during allergy season using written and telephone surveys, symptom diaries, and encounter data. Measurable outcomes were established for provider and patient behavior. Patient outcomes were derived from a preventive behavior index and administrative data reporting the use of 5 medication classes. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of providers modified their practice patterns as a result of the intervention program. Patient outcomes showed a decrease in the use of rescue medications, particularly antibiotics, and an increase in preventive measures in the treatment group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The EOC model resulted in positive changes in provider and patient behavior. The multidisciplinary approach resulted in extensive supplier participation.",0,0,
1708,Targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: a review of the development of a new class of medications from the perspective of community mental health researchers.,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with positive and negative symptoms and extensive deficits in neurocognitive function. Neurocognitive deficits are considered the core pathophysiological symptoms of the disease. Neurocognitive deficits are also closely associated with functional outcome. Currently, cognitive deficits remain one of the most important unmet therapeutic needs in schizophrenia. AREAS COVERED: Neuroscientific discoveries in the last few decades have enriched our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This research has identified new molecular mechanisms and processes as promising drug targets. However, despite extensive efforts to develop a new class of cognition-enhancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia over the past 5 years, no new pharmacological agents have received the required regulatory approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Efficacy and safety results from selective phase II clinical trials are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Critically examines the evolving concept of neurocognition and current guidelines for the design and methodology of clinical trials of cognition-enhancing drugs for the treatment of people with schizophrenia. Future directions in the development of cognition-enhancing medications for the treatment of schizophrenia are discussed from the perspective of clinicians and researchers in community mental health settings.",0,0,
1709,Working group VI: Self-monitoring of blood pressure,"BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients at home or in other nonclinical settings has become increasingly common in recent years. This phenomenon has been fueled in part by the increased availability of automated sphygmomanometers, which are now affordable and easy for patients to use. BENEFITS OF SELF-MONITORING: Self-monitoring of blood pressure can be an important adjunct to the control of hypertension. The technique allows patients to be more involved in their care. Self-measured blood pressure values are more likely to be representative of average daily blood pressure than a clinical measurement and may be better related to hypertensive end-organ involvement and cardiovascular morbidity than clinical blood pressure. Finally, self-monitoring of blood pressure has the potential to reduce the costs of care related to hypertension. LIMITATIONS OF SELF-MONITORING: There are several issues that prevent the more widespread use of self-monitoring of blood pressure in clinical practice. First, devices marketed for patient use have advanced technically during the 1990s, but many have not undergone rigorous clinical validation for accuracy and reliability (for example, in terms of the Association for Advances in Medical Instrumentation and the British Society of Hypertension). It is recommended that blood pressure measurement devices used by patients at home undergo the same validation processes as those applied to ambulatory records. Second, although the upper limits of normal for self-monitored blood pressure in a general population can be defined statistically (it is approximately 135/85 mmHg), it is not yet possible to determine normal self-monitored blood pressure because these values must be linked to endpoints. or classical clinical cardiovascular outcomes. Third, the relationships between self-monitored, clinical, and ambulatory blood pressures are well defined for some populations, but their behaviors by age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment status require further study. Fourth, several different programs for self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients have been used in clinical practice and research. It will be necessary to determine the optimal time and number of records required when patients self-monitor their blood pressure. Fifth, self-monitoring of blood pressure in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapies is feasible, but has generally not been included in their design, either by investigators or pharmaceutical sponsors. Sixth, there have been data suggesting that self-monitoring of blood pressure reduces the overall costs associated with hypertension care on a yearly basis. However, since most of the work on the economic impact of blood pressure self-monitoring has been done in managed care settings in the US, it is not known whether this reduction in health care costs would be applicable to other types of practice settings. Worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure self-monitoring is currently useful as an adjunctive measure for the treatment of hypertensive patients and could provide benefit in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. However, available data on blood pressure self-monitoring are inadequate as a basis for clinicians to make primary diagnostic or therapeutic decisions and should not override blood pressure obtained by clinical measurement or ambulatory monitoring.",0,0,
1710,Teaching Appropriate Interactions with Pharmaceutical Company Representatives: The Impact of an Innovative Workshop on Student Attitudes,"BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical company representatives (PCRs) influence the prescribing habits and professional behavior of physicians. However, the skills to interact with PCR are not taught in the traditional medical school curriculum. We examined whether an innovative mandatory workshop for third-year medical students had immediate effects on knowledge and attitudes regarding interactions with RCPs. METHODS: Surveys conducted before and after the workshop intervention solicited opinions (five-point Likert scale) from third-year students (n = 75) on the degree of bias in CRP reporting, the influence of CRP on prescribing habits, the acceptability of specific gifts, and the educational value of PCR information for both practicing physicians and students. Two faculty members and a PCR led the workshop, which highlighted typical physician-PCR interactions, the use of samples and gifts, the validity and legal limits of PCR information, and associated ethical issues. Role plays with CRP demonstrated appropriate and inappropriate strategies for interacting with CRP. RESULTS: The majority of third-year students (56%, 42/75) had experienced more than three face-to-face conversations with a PCR about a medication since they started medical school. Five percent (4/75) stated that they had no previous personal experience with PCR. Most of the students (57.3%, 43/75) were unaware of the available guidelines regarding PCR interactions. Twenty-eight percent of students (21/75) thought that none of the activities/gifts mentioned (access to lunch, free stethoscope, textbooks, educational CD-ROMS, sporting events) should be restricted, while 24.0 % (8/75) thought that students should be restricted from sporting events only. The perceived educational value of CRP information for both practicing physicians and students increased after the workshop intervention from 17.7% to 43.2% (chi-squared, p=0.0001) and from 22.1% to % to 40.5% (p = 0.0007), respectively. The students' perception of the degree of bias in the PCR information decreased from 84.1% to 72.9% (p = 0.065), but the degree of perceived influence on prescription increased (44.2% to 62.1% % (p = 0.02)). CONCLUSIONS: Students have exposure to CRP early in their medical training. A single workshop intervention may influence students' attitudes toward interactions with RCPs. Students were more likely to recognize the educational value of PCR interactions and their impact on prescribing after the workshop intervention.",0,0,

Design A prospective study of handwashing before and after patient contact. Setting A pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care hospital. Participants 61 medical staff from the intensive care unit and visiting medical staff. Interventions A five-phase behavior modification program: (i) discreet observation for four weeks to obtain a ""baseline handwashing rate""; (ii) open observation for five weeks (preceded by written counselling); (iii) open observation continued for four weeks with feedback on performance; (iv) all observations and feedback were suspended for seven weeks;"" and (v) discrete observation for five weeks to obtain a residual rate. Results 939 patient contacts were observed. Baseline rates of handwashing before and after patient contact were 12.4% and 10.6%, respectively. During open observation, the respective rates increased and plateaued at 32.7% and 33.3%, but increased further (to 68.3% and 64.8%) during the performance feedback period. Residual handwashing rates, observed discreetly seven weeks after cessation of performance feedback, were 54.6% before and 54.9% after patient contact. Conclusions Performance feedback is moderately effective in training hospital medical staff in handwashing.",0,1,
1712,"Unraveling the ""Tangled Web"" of Policy Dialogue Influence: Lessons from a Case Study of Health Reform Options Dialogues for Canada","Background The literature on knowledge sharing suggests that policy dialogues are intended to enhance the short-, medium-, and long-term capacities of individuals, organizations, and health systems to use evidence to inform policymaking. Key characteristics of effective dialogues have been suggested, but the links between these characteristics and the realization of enhanced capacities for evidence-based policymaking among dialogue attendees and subsequent influence on policymaking activities are not understood. good. Methods We conducted a qualitative case study of a series of four policy dialogues that were convened in Canada among national, provincial, and regional stakeholders on issues related to health care financing and financing in 2011. Data sources they included videos of the participants' perspectives captured during or immediately after each. event and follow-up key informant interviews among dialogue participants conducted 4 years later, in 2015. Three conceptual frameworks related to (i) dialogues on policies and capacities for the use of evidence, (ii) factors that shape the formulation throughout the policy cycle and (iii) the factors that shaped the implementation of the evidence guided the thematic analysis. We then synthesized the findings across the three frameworks. Results The results suggest that the potential benefits of the policy dialogues described in the literature were developed among the participants in these dialogues. Informants explained how the characteristics of the dialogue influenced their abilities to use evidence, ideas, interests, and institutions during the agenda-setting and policy-making stages, and how implementation was affected by the characteristics of the options. policy, people, organizations and the external environment. and processes. Conclusions We present a conceptual framework that broadens our understanding of the potential influence of policy dialogues on the content and mechanisms of policy development and illustrates the pathways of influence at various stages of the policy cycle from agenda setting to formulation. and implementation. The framework highlights important factors to consider in designing and evaluating policy dialogues and in supporting post-dialogue knowledge-sharing efforts.",0,0,
1713,Educational Teleconference Details: Diabetes Education for Primary Care Physicians,"INTRODUCTION: Formal didactic continuing medical education (CME) is relatively ineffective in changing medical behavior. Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease and interventions are required to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPG). METHODS: A stratified, cluster-randomized, controlled trial design was used to assess the effects of a detailed teleconference educational CME (TED) on glycemic control (hemoglobin [Hb] A1c) and GP adherence to guidelines. diabetes nationals. TED used sequential, small group, and case-based education using CPGs delivered by a diabetes specialist. Medical record audit data were compared from baseline to the end of a 12-month post-intervention period for the control and intervention groups. Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-one physicians provided 660 medical records. The intervention did not affect mean Hb A1c levels but did significantly (p = 0.04) alter the distribution of patients by glycemic control category, with fewer in the intervention group with inadequate control (15.8% versus 23.9% ). More patients took insulin (alone or with oral agents) in the intervention group (21.2% vs 12.0%, p = 0.03) and more patients took oral agents alone in the control group (89.0 % vs. 82.9%, p = 0.005). More patients in the intervention group had documentation of body mass index (7.8% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.02), eye exam (12.1% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.02) and treatment plan (43.5% vs. 23.6%, p = 0.01) and used a flowchart (14.6% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.03 ). Although there was general satisfaction with the teleconference format, specialist educators found the format more challenging than GPs. DISCUSSION: CME delivered via teleconference was feasible, well attended, well received by participants, and improved some key diabetes management practices and outcomes.",0,0,
1714,Telehealth for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE Ã‚Â To assess whether non-clinical staff can effectively manage people at high risk for cardiovascular disease using digital health technologies. DESIGN Ã‚Â Randomized, multicentre, pragmatic controlled trial. SETTING Ã‚Â 42 general practices in three areas of England. PARTICIPANTS Ã‚Â Between December 3, 2012, and July 23, 2013, we recruited 641 adults aged 40 to 74 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 20% or greater, no prior cardiovascular event, at least one modifiable risk factor (systolic blood pressure Ã¢â€°Â¥140 mm Hg, body mass index Ã¢â€°Â¥30, current smoker), and access to telephone, internet, and email. Participants were individually assigned to intervention (n=325) or control (n=316) groups using automatic randomization stratified by site, minimized by practice, and baseline risk score. INTERVENTIONS Ã‚Â The intervention was the Healthlines service (along with usual care), comprising regular phone calls from trained lay health advisors following scripts generated by interactive software. Counselors facilitated self-management by helping participants use online resources to reduce risk factors and sought to optimize medication use, improve treatment adherence, and encourage healthier lifestyles. The control group comprised only usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Ã‚Â The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who responded to treatment, defined as maintaining or reducing their cardiovascular risk after 12 months. Results were collected at six and 12 months after randomisation and analyzed blinded. The participants were not masked. RESULTS: 50% (148/295) of participants in the intervention group responded to treatment compared to 43% (124/291) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval). % 1.0 to 1.9""; number needed to treat = 13); a difference possibly due to chance (P = 0.08). The intervention was associated with reductions in blood pressure (difference in mean systolic -2, 7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -4.7 to -0.6 mm Hg), mean diastolic -2.8 (-4.0 to -1.6 mm Hg);"" weight -1.0 kg (-1.8 to -0.3 kg) and body mass index -0.4 (-0.6 to -0.1) but not cholesterol -0.1 (-0.2 to 0.0), smoking (adjusted odds ratio 0.4, 0.2 to 1.0) or global cardiovascular risk as a continuous measure (-0.4, -1.2 to 0.3). The intervention was associated with improvements in diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and satisfaction with access to care, treatment received, and coordination of care. A related serious adverse event occurred when a participant was admitted to hospital with low blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS Ã‚Â This evidence-based telehealth approach was associated with small clinical benefits for a minority of people at high cardiovascular risk, and there was no overall improvement in average risk. However, the Healthlines service was associated with improvements in some risk behaviors and in perceptions of support and access to care.

1715,Call center management to improve cancer detection among low-income women,"Background Minority and low-income women receive fewer cancer screening tests than other women. Objective To assess the effect of a telephone support intervention in increasing breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening rates among low-income and minority women. Design Randomized controlled trial conducted between November 2001 and April 2004. Setting 11 migrant and community health centers in New York City. Patients 1,413 women who had been late for cancer screening. Intervention Over 18 months, women assigned to the intervention group received an average of 4 calls from preventive care managers and the control group received usual care. Follow-up data was available for 99% of women, and 91% of the intervention group received at least 1 call. women who received a mammogram increased from 0.58 to 0.68 with the intervention and decreased from 0.60 to 0.58 with usual care""; the proportion who received a Pap smear increased from 0, 71 to 0.78 with intervention and did not change with usual care""; and the proportion undergoing colorectal screening increased from 0.39 to 0.63 with the intervention and from 0.39 to 0.50 with usual care. The difference in change in detection rates between groups was 0.12 for mammography (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.19), 0.07 for Pap smear (CI, 0.01 to 0.12) and 0.13 for colorectal screening (CI, 0.07 to 0.19). The proportion of women who were up to date on 3 tests increased from 0.21 to 0.43 with the intervention. Limitations Participants were from 1 city and had access to a regular source of care. Medical records may not have recorded all cancer screening tests. Conclusions Telephone support can improve cancer screening rates among women visiting community and migrant health centers. The intervention appears to be suitable for health plans, large medical groups, and other organizations seeking to increase cancer detection rates and address disparities in care.",0,0,
1716,"Telephone Screening, Disclosure, and Care Management for Depressed Workers and Impact on Work Productivity and Clinical Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Context Although guideline-consistent treatment of depression is clearly effective, treatment often falls short of evidence-based recommendations. Organized depression care programs significantly improve the quality of treatment, but employer purchasers have been slow to adopt these programs due to a lack of evidence of cost-effectiveness from their perspective. Objective To assess the effects of a depression treatment program on workplace outcomes, a concern for employers. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized controlled trial involving 604 employees covered by a managed behavioral health plan were identified in a two-stage screening process with significant depression. Patients' treatment allocation was concealed, and assessment of depression severity and work performance at 6 and 12 months was blinded. Employees with lifetime bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, recent specialty mental health care, or suicidality were excluded. Intervention A telephone outreach and care management program encouraged workers to enter outpatient treatment (psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medication), monitored continuity of treatment quality, and attempted to improve treatment by giving recommendations to providers. Participants reluctant to start treatment were offered structured telephone cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. Main outcome measures Severity of depression (Rapid Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, QIDS) and job performance (World Health Organization Health and Productivity Questionnaire [HPQ], a validated self-report instrument that assesses job retention, time lost at work, job performance and critical workplace incidents). Results Combining data from the 6-month and 12-month evaluations, the intervention group had significantly lower self-report QIDS scores (odds ratio of recovery, 1.4""; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2, 0; P = .009), retention (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.3; P = .02), and significantly more hours worked between intervention (ß=2 .0; P=0.02;"" equivalent to an annualized effect of 2 weeks of work) than the usual care groups who were employed. Conclusions A systematic program to identify depression and promote effective treatment significantly improves not only clinical outcomes but also workplace outcomes. The financial value of the latter to employers in terms of costs of hiring, training, and recovered wages suggests that many employers would experience a positive return on investment from outreach and improved treatment of depressed workers.",0,0,
1717,Collaborative care delivered over the phone to treat post-CABG depression,"Context Depressive symptoms commonly follow coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and are associated with less positive clinical outcomes. Objective To test the effectiveness of collaborative care delivered by telephone for post-CABG depression compared to usual medical care. Design, Setting, and Participants Single-blind efficacy trial at 7 university and community hospitals in or near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants were 302 post-CABG patients with depression (150, intervention; 152, usual care) and a randomly selected comparison group of 151 post-CABG patients without depression recruited between March 2004 and September 2007 and observed as patients. until June 2008. Intervention Eight months of collaborative telephone care provided by nurses working with patients' primary care physicians and supervised by a psychiatrist and a primary care physician from this study Main outcome measures Quality of life related to mental health (HRQL) as measured by the short form -36 Mental Component Summary (SF-36 MCS) at 8-month follow-up, secondary outcome measures included assessment of mood symptoms (Health Rating Scale) Hamilton for depression [HRS-D]), physical HRQoL (SF-36 PCS) and functional status (Duke Activity Status Index [DASI]), and reing hospital inmates Results Intervention patients reported greater improvements in mental HRQoL (all P = 0.02) (SF-36 MCS: ?, 3.2 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-6.0), physical functioning (DASI: ?, 4.6 points; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3), and mood symptoms (HRS-D: ?, 3.1 points; 95% CI, 1.3-4.9); and were more likely to report a 50% or greater decrease in HRS-D score from baseline (50.0% vs. 29.6%; number needed to treat, 4.9 [95% CI, 3, 2-10.4]) than usual care patients (P < 0.001). 001). Depressed men were more likely to benefit from the intervention (SF-36 MCS: ?, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 2.2-9.2; P = .001). However, the mean HRQoL and physical functioning of intervention patients did not match that of the comparison group without depression. Conclusion Compared with usual care, collaborative care delivered by telephone for the treatment of depression after CABG resulted in improvement in HRQoL, physical functioning, and mood symptoms at 8-month follow-up.",0,0,
1718,Telepractice in the assessment and treatment of people with autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: Studies related to the use of telepractice in the provision of services to people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were reviewed with the intention of informing practice and identifying areas for future research. METHODS: Systematic searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and journals identified eight studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed and summarized in terms of: (a) participant characteristics, (b) technology used, (c) services provided through telepractice, (d) research methodology, and (e) study results. RESULTS: Telepractice was used by university researchers, behavior analysts, psychiatrists, and psychologists to assist caregivers and educators in providing services to 46 participants with ASD. Services provided included behavioral and diagnostic evaluations, educational consulting, guidance and supervision of behavioral interventions, and coaching/training in the implementation of a comprehensive early intervention program. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that telepractice is a promising service delivery approach in treating people with ASD that warrants further investigation. Guidelines for practitioners and potential directions for future research are discussed.",0,0,
1719,Test Ordering Guidelines May Disrupt Ordering Patterns in an Academic Emergency Department,"To determine the impact of an educational program designed to modify test-seeking behavior in an academic Emergency Department (ED), an observational before-and-after study was conducted at a university-based tertiary referral center and Medicine residency site. Emergency (EM). Test request standards were developed by EM, RN, and NP teachers based on group consensus and published data. The standards were issued to all ED staff beginning in February 1996 and were included in the evidence-based medicine orientation and educational program for all residents and medical students prior to beginning their rotation. No restrictions were placed on the request for actual evidence. The number of laboratory tests (total and individual) ordered per 100 patients decreased significantly after the educational program began for: total test, CBC and liver function test (LFT). Furthermore, the decreases during individual months for these tests were statistically significant. Prothrombin time and blood culture tests did not show significant decreases in the frequency of requesting tests. The frequency of requesting chemistry tests showed statistically significant increases. Overall, approximately $50,000 was saved by decreasing the testing order. Test requesting behavior can be modified and maintained by an educational program and can have significant economic effects.",0,0,

1721,Evidence of the efficacy of an innovative information package on professional-reported behavior and beliefs: the UK Low Back Pain Management (COMPLEMENT) trial [ISRCTN77245761],"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly problem. Initiatives designed to help physicians and patients make decisions about appropriate medical care for low back pain include evidence-based printed clinical guidelines. The three professional groups of chiropractic, osteopathy and musculoskeletal physiotherapy in the UK share common ground with their approaches to managing low back pain and are among the recipients of the low back pain guidelines. Still, many seem unaware that such guidelines exist. Furthermore, the behavior of at least some of these professionals differs from that recommended in these guidelines. Few randomized controlled trials evaluating print information as an intervention to change practitioner behavior have used a no-intervention control. All of these trials used a cluster design and most have methodological flaws. None specifically focus on physician behavior toward patients with low back pain. Studies that have investigated other strategies to change physician behavior with patients with low back pain have produced conflicting results. Although numerous LBP guidelines have been developed around the world, there is a paucity of data on whether their dissemination actually changes clinician behaviour. Mainly due to its low unit cost, sending printed information to a large number of professionals is an attractive dissemination and implementation strategy. The effect size of such a strategy, at the level of an individual practitioner, is likely to be small. However, if a large number of professionals are targeted, this strategy could achieve significant changes at the population level. METHODS: The primary objective of this prospective, pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial is to test the short-term (six months post-intervention) effectiveness of a directly published information package on reported clinical behavior (primary outcome), attitudes, and UK beliefs. chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physical therapists. We attempted to randomly assign a pooled sample of 1,800 practitioners who consented to receive the information pack (intervention arm) or no information above that obtained during normal practice (control arm). We collected questionnaire data at baseline and six months after the intervention. The primary outcome analysis will assess between-arm differences in the proportions of responses to questions about recommendations on activity, work, and bed rest, which fall within categories previously defined by a consensus exercise. experts as ""consistent with the guideline"" and ""in accordance with the guideline"". -inconsistent'.",0,0,

1723,Texas Children's Medication Algorithm Project: Update from the Texas Consensus Conference Panel on Medication Treatment of Childhood Major Depressive Disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To review and update consensus guidelines for medication treatment algorithms for childhood major depressive disorder based on new scientific evidence and expert clinical consensus when evidence is lacking. METHOD: A consensus conference was held on January 13-14, 2005, including academic physicians and researchers, practicing physicians, administrators, consumers, and families. The focus was to review, update, and incorporate the most current data to inform and recommend specific pharmacological approaches and clinical guidance for the treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Consensus medication algorithms for major depression (with and without psychosis) and comorbid attention deficit disorders were updated. These revised algorithms also incorporated approaches to address issues of suicidality, aggression, and irritability. Stages 1, 2, and 3 of the algorithm consist of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor medications whose use is supported by acute controlled clinical trials and clinical experience. Recent studies support that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in addition to fluoxetine, are still recommended as first-line interventions. The need for additional evaluations, precautions, and monitoring, as well as continuation and maintenance treatment, is emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence and expert clinical consensus support the use of selected antidepressants in the treatment of depression in youth. Use of recommended antidepressant medications requires adequate control of suicidality and potential adverse effects and consideration of other evidence-based treatment alternatives, such as cognitive behavioral therapies.",0,0,
1724,"The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on blood cholesterol management to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults: the good, the bad, and the uncertain: a comparison with the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time, both in Europe and in the rest of the world, and represents the largest expenditure in most health budgets. Achieving consistency in clinical care, incorporating new evidence, and synthesizing it into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline committees around the world. Therefore, any change to a set of guidelines can have far-reaching consequences, particularly if they appear to be at odds with existing guidelines. This article reviews the recent 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on monitoring blood cholesterol to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. Compared to the 2011 ESC/EAS lipid modification guidelines, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines differ markedly. Specifically, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials only, excluding a significant set of data and essentially promoting a ""statin-only approach""; (ii) the abolition of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets ( LDL-C) in favor of specific statin regimens that produce a 30-50% reduction in LDL-C, we believe will confuse many clinicians and miss the opportunity for medication adherence and patient participation in self-monitoring; ( iii) the absence of target LDL-C levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute risk or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians from considering adding lipid-altering therapies and individualizing patient care; (iv ) a reduction in the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in more patients being prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients at high risk for life, but will result in a large number of older patients being offered therapy;"" and (v) the mixed group risk calculator used to assess CVD risk in guidelines for primary prevention has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential implications of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the view that the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines appear to be the most comprehensive, pragmatic and appropriate option for European countries.",0,0,

1726,The AHCPR Heart Failure Guidelines: Comparison of a Family Medicine and Internal Medicine Practice with the Guidelines and an Educational Behavior Modification Intervention,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to apply the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guideline for heart failure to the measurement of quality of care in the outpatient setting, compare the results of two large practices and design an educational program. intervention for the two practices under study. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a random sample of 50 heart failure patients selected from each of two outpatient clinics: the general internal medicine clinic and the family medicine clinic at a large academic medical center. Five medical review criteria were developed from the AHCPR guideline for heart failure to compare the two practices with each other and with the guidelines. An educational intervention was developed to modify the physician's behavior regarding compliance with the guidelines. RESULTS: Evaluation of left ventricular function occurred in 79% of all cases. Of eligible patients, 68% were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). Of the patients treated with enalapril and captopril, 30% and 12%, respectively, received the target dose defined in the AHCPR guidelines. Of the patients ineligible for ACE-I treatment, none were treated with hydralazine and nitrates. When the ejection fraction was less than or equal to 40%, 81% of eligible patients were treated with ACE inhibitors, while 59% were treated with ACE inhibitors when the ejection fraction was greater than 40%. Calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment of 42% of patients. A statistical difference (p = 0.05) was found between the two practices for documentation of left ventricular function, the use of ACE-I for patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and the use of ventricular blockers. Calcium Channels and Beta Blockers CONCLUSIONS: In the practices studied, there is underuse of documentation of left ventricular function, ACE-Is in eligible patients, target dose of ACE-Is, and the use of hydralazine and nitrates for ineligible patients. A higher proportion of patients are treated with ACE-I when the ejection fraction is less than or equal to 40%. There may be inappropriate use of calcium channel blockers in some patients. There is an unexplained clinical variation between the two practices studied.",0,0,
1727,The Altruistic Medical Researcher: Gone and Forgotten?,"With increasing economic, political, and bureaucratic involvement in research, little attention is paid to the idealistic and benevolent intentions of the medical researcher. Benevolence is a mainstay of ethical research involving human subjects, and altruism is a form of benevolence that is difficult to quantify. It is interest in the welfare of others without personal gain. This article examines the scope of altruism in medical research from philosophical, psychological, and practical points of view. With the advent of experimental trials in humans in the first half of the century, the fame and recognition of physicians greatly impeded altruistic motivation. From a philosophical perspective, altruism is at best an optional moral principle. It is not evident in the ethical guidelines. In the scientific process, altruism can only exist in well-designed and ethical research. Selfishness, scientific misconduct, and conflicts of interest undermine it”; but altruism is also a potential solution to these problems. Research does not have a global orientation and is unfairly distributed. In an evolutionary model, altruism cannot thrive due to its lack of rewards and feedback, particularly in the economic climate of current science. Anonymity is decreasing, selfishness is increasing. Research has become an industry, and virtuous ideals are a romantic notion. If we use altruism as an indicator, then its rarity and fragility indicate the sick state of the research.",0,0,
1728,American Society for Clinical Psychopharmacology Survey of Psychopharmacologists' Practice Patterns for the Treatment of Mood Disorders,"BACKGROUND: Optimal successive treatment decisions are not well established after an initial lack of response to medication in major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. While practice guidelines offer expert consensus-based treatment recommendations, little is known about ""real world"" pharmacological decision-making by practicing psychopharmacologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed national members of the American Society for Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) via the Internet to study preferred pharmacotherapy strategies and factors influencing medication choice for patients with mood disorders. RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 154/752 ASCP members (21%). After lack of response to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in major depressive disorder, participants similarly favored switching within or between antidepressant classes. After a partial response, adjuvant bupropion was the preferred intervention, followed by switching antidepressant classes. The increase in atypical antipsychotics was only a fourth-line consideration, although moderate or marked efficacy was perceived in most cases with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine. Respondents favored avoiding antidepressants in bipolar I patients with mixed/cyclical features or prior mania/hypomania associated with antidepressants. In rapid cyclers, they recommended stopping antidepressants and preferred the use of atypical antipsychotics and lamotrigine. CONCLUSIONS: Participating psychopharmacologists treating adults with mood disorders report prescribing medications that largely reflect the evidence base with only a few notable exceptions, in consideration of the characteristics of definable clinical subpopulations.",0,0,

Objective Using a microsimulation model of HIV detection, disease and treatment HIV, we estimate the clinical and economic value of achieving this ambitious goal in South Africa. Design We modeled: the Current Pace strategy, simulating existing scale-up efforts and gradual increases in overall virologic suppression from 24% to 36% over 5 years"";"" and the UNAIDS Target strategy, simulating a 73% suppression in 5 years. Data sources Published estimates and South African survey data report HIV transmission rates (0.16–9.03/100 PY), HIV-specific age-stratified fertility rates (1.0–9, 1/100 PY) and costs (ART: $11–100 PY) 31/month, routine care: $20-157/month). Target population South African population infected with HIV, including incident infections over the next ten years Perspective Modified social perspective, excluding time and productivity costs Time horizon Five and ten years Interventions Aggressive HIV case finding, efficient linkage to care, rapid scale-up of treatment and adherence/retention interventions towards UNAIDS target strategy Outcome measures HIV transmissions, deaths, years of life saved (YLS), maternal orphans, costs (2014USD) and cost-effectiveness Base case analysis compared to baseline current rate over (5 y) In 10 years, the UNAIDS Target strategy would prevent (873,000) 2,051,000 HIV transmissions, (1,174,000) 2,478,000 deaths and (726,000) 1,689,000 maternal orphans, while saving (3,002,000) 13,340,000 years of life. The additional budget required for the UNAIDS Target Strategy would be ($7,965) $15,979 billion, resulting in an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of ($2,720/YLS) $1,260/YLS, (<50%) <20% of South Africa per capita GDP. Sensitivity analysis results Results generally varied <20% from the base case results when we varied key input parameters within plausible ranges.

1731,"The assessment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in rural primary care: portability of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines to the ""real world"".","Goal. To examine the implementation of a protocol for the evaluation of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in rural pediatric practices. The protocol was designed to provide an efficient means for pediatricians to learn and use the ADHD guidelines put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Methods. Primary care staff (doctors, nurses, etc.) from 2 rural pediatric clinics were trained in the use of the ADHD screening protocol. Medical records of 101 patients 1 to 2 years prior to protocol introduction and 86 patients 2 to 3 years thereafter were reviewed for compliance with AAP guidelines. Additionally, 34% of staff-rated scales were re-rated to verify rating accuracy. Results. Prior to the availability of the AAP guidelines and the implementation of the assessment protocol, none of the primary care sites consistently collected the comprehensive information now recommended for an ADHD assessment. Parent and/or teacher rating scales were collected for only 0% to 21% of assessments across all sites. When provided with brief training and support materials, medical records showed a significant improvement in determining clinically necessary ADHD information, with parent-teacher rating scales present from 88% to 100% of the time. Staff demonstrated the ability to rate rating scales with a high degree of accuracy. The integrity of protocol collection and management was maintained 2 to 3 years after training. Conclusions. An efficient system for conducting ADHD assessments according to AAP guidelines can be initiated and maintained with integrity in rural pediatric clinics.

1732,The behavioral economics of health and healthcare,"People often make health care decisions that aren't in their best interest, from not signing up for the health insurance they're entitled to to engaging in extremely harmful behavior. Traditional economic theory provides a limited set of tools for improving behavior because it assumes that people make decisions rationally, have the mental capacity to handle large amounts of information and choice, and have endemic tastes and are not open to manipulation. By merging economics with psychology, behavioral economics recognizes that people often do not act rationally in the economic sense. Thus, it offers a potentially richer set of tools than traditional economic theory for understanding and influencing behaviors. However, it has only recently been applied to health care. This article provides an overview of behavioral economics, reviews some of its contributions, and shows how it can be used in health care to improve people's decisions and health.",0,1,
1733,The Behavior Change Wheel: A New Method for Characterizing and Designing Behavior Change Interventions,"Background Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on the success of behavior change interventions. This requires an appropriate method to characterize the interventions and link them to an analysis of the target behaviour. A plethora of behavior change intervention frameworks exist, but it is unclear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks and develops and evaluates a new framework intended to overcome their limitations. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases and consultations with experts in behavior change were used to identify frameworks for behavior change interventions. These were assessed according to three criteria: completeness, consistency, and a clear link to a general pattern of behaviour. A new framework was developed to meet these criteria. We examined the reliability with which it could be applied in two behavior change domains: tobacco control and obesity. Results Nineteen frameworks covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable those interventions were identified. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention roles or policies, and only a minority met the criteria for consistency or linkage to a behavioral pattern. At the core of a proposed new framework is a 'behavioral system' involving three essential conditions: ability, opportunity and motivation (what we call the 'COM-B system'). This forms the center of a 'behaviour change wheel' (BCW) around which are located the nine intervention functions intended to address deficits in one or more of these conditions"";"" Around this are seven categories of policies that could allow such interventions to occur. The BCW was reliably used to characterize interventions within the 2010 Department of Health England tobacco control strategy and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance for reducing obesity. Conclusions Interventions and policies to change behavior can be usefully characterized by a BCW comprising: a 'behaviour system' at the core, surrounded by intervention functions and then by policy categories. Research is needed to establish to what extent BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.",0,0,

METHODS: Several system changes were developed within primary care practice management software to identify the cohort of patients eligible for cardiovascular risk screening, to calculate cardiovascular disease risk (CVR), and to extract the data for cardiovascular risk screening. report on screening results and clinical management indicators in high-risk patients. patients Following a baseline audit, system changes were tested for 12 months in three general practices with a combined enrolled patient population of 30,963. RESULTS: A total of 6570 eligible patients were identified for NZGG"";"" 20.1% of these were Maori and 19.7% were Pacific people (mostly of Samoan, Tongan, Niuean or Cook Island origin). Over 12 months, screening rates for cardiovascular risk assessment increased from 4.7% to 53.5% for the cohort. Of the 3,516 patients examined, 482 (13.7%) had established cardiovascular disease. Another 230 (6.5%) had diabetes without CVD and 646 (18.4%) had a 5-year CVD risk of > or = 15%. Management data were available on 232 (48.1%) of those with CVD, 74%, 65%, and 79% taking aspirin, statins, and blood pressure-lowering medications, respectively. 55% exceeded the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) target of 2.5 mmol/L, 62% had a systolic blood pressure (BP) above the target of 130 mmHg, 18% continued to smoke, and only 9% met all the clinical objectives recommended in the guideline. Of 646 with a 5-year CVD risk > or = 15%, management data was available for 347 (53.7%). Only 34% were prescribed aspirin, 40% were prescribed statins, and 57% were prescribed blood pressure-lowering medications. Forty percent of this group had systolic BP >140 mmHg, 36% had LDL >3.5 mmol/L, and only 7% of patients met all guideline clinical targets. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the system comprising this intervention have dramatically increased cardiovascular risk assessment rates in a primary care setting and will facilitate appropriate targeting of intensive cardiovascular prevention measures to close the observed treatment gap.",0,1,

However, implementation of this strategy was problematic. Our goal was the large-scale implementation of a tailored strategy covering both test ordering and prescription performance. Since we were unable to achieve a large-scale implementation, the objective of this study was to describe and analyze the challenges of the transfer process. METHODS: In a qualitative study, 19 regional health officers, pharmacists, laboratory specialists, and general practitioners were interviewed within 6 months of the transfer period. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and coded independently by two of the authors. The codes were matched with the dimensions of the normalization process theory. RESULTS: The general idea of the strategy was widely supported, but generating the feedback was more complex than expected and the need for external support after the transfer of the strategy remained high because the participants did not take responsibility for the work and distribution of the resources that arrived. with that. CONCLUSION: Evidence of effectiveness, a national infrastructure for these collaborations, and a general positive attitude were not sufficient for standardization. Thinking about managing large databases, task responsibility, and resource allocation should start as early as possible when planning complex quality improvement strategies. Simply exploring the barriers and facilitators experienced in a previous trial is not enough. Although multifaceted implementation strategies to change professional behavior are attractive, their inherent complexity is also a stumbling block for large-scale implementation.",0,0,
1738,The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological interventions for secondary prevention of relapse after depression: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common mental disorder in community settings and a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission or at least adequate control of depressive symptoms; however, even after successful treatment, the risk of relapse after remission is significant. Although the effectiveness of low-intensity interventions has been extensively evaluated for treating the primary symptoms of psychological distress, there has been substantially less research examining the use of these interventions as a relapse prevention strategy. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the clinical and the cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological or psychosocial interventions to prevent relapse or recurrence in people with depression As the broader definition of 'low-intensity' psychological intervention is somewhat contested, the review was conducted in two parts: A , a systematic review of all evaluations of 'low intensity' interventions by paraprofessionals, peer supporters, or psychological well-being professionals as defined by the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies program; and B, a scoping review of relevant evaluations of interventions involving qualified mental health professionals (eg, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, cognitive behavioral therapists) involving <6 contact hours per patient. DATA SOURCES: Exhaustive bibliographic searches were carried out; Electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2010 (including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library), using internet resources to identify treatment guidelines of depression and bibliographies of Relevant reviews, guidelines and included studies were scrutinised. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts; data were independently extracted by one reviewer using a standardized data extraction form and checked by another reviewer. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, with the participation of a third reviewer when necessary. Inclusion criteria were population - adults or adolescents who had received treatment for depression; intervention - part A, low-intensity interventions, specifically any unsupported psychological/psychosocial intervention or any supported intervention that does not involve highly qualified mental health professionals, and, part B, interventions performed by qualified mental health professionals that involve < 6 contact hours per patient; comparator: any, including no treatment, placebo, psychological or pharmacological interventions; outcomes: relapse or recurrence, other outcomes (eg social function, quality of life) recorded where reported; and study design: for clinical efficacy, randomized, quasi-randomized, and nonrandomized studies with concurrent control patients. For cost-effectiveness, full economic evaluations comparing two or more treatment options and considering both costs and consequences. No study met the inclusion criteria for Part A main. RESULTS: For the clinical effectiveness review, 17 studies (14 completed, 3 ongoing), reported in 27 publications, met the Part B inclusion criteria. These studies were clinically and methodologically diverse and reported different degrees of efficacy for the interventions evaluated. One randomized controlled trial (RCT), evaluating a collaborative care type programme, was potentially relevant to part A; this study reported no difference between people who received the intervention and those who received usual care in relapse of depression over 12 months. For the cost-effectiveness review, two studies met the criteria for part B. One of these was an economic evaluation of the earlier RCT, which was potentially relevant to part A. This evaluation found that the intervention may be a cost-effective use of resources compared to usual care; however, it was unclear how valid these estimates were for the NHS. LIMITATIONS: Although any definition of 'brief' is likely to be somewhat arbitrary, an inclusion threshold of 6 contact hours per patient was used to select brief high-intensity intervention studies. Most of the excluded studies evaluated clearly resource-intensive interventions, although studies were occasionally excluded on the basis of having just over 6 contact hours per patient. CONCLUSIONS: There is inadequate evidence to determine the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of low-intensity interventions for the prevention of relapse or recurrence of depression. A scoping review of high-intensity brief therapies indicates that some approaches have shown promise in some studies, but the findings have not been consistent. Many uncertainties remain and more primary research is required. The scope of such research should be carefully considered; it is important to assess the broader patient pathway taking into account the heterogeneous groups of patients of interest. Future RCTs conducted in a UK primary care setting should include adult participants in remission or recovery from depression, and assess the quality of the intervention and consistency of delivery between practitioners where appropriate. The occurrence of relapse or recurrence should be measured using established methods, and functional outcomes and symptoms should be measured;"" data on quality of life using a generic instrument, such as the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), should be collected FUNDING: Health Technology Assessment Program of the National Institute for Health Research.",0,0,
1739,The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men.,"Context Homosexual and bisexual men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for human papillomavirus-associated anal neoplasia and anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Objective To estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) and anal SCC in HIV-positive gay and bisexual men. Design Cost-effectiveness analysis conducted from a societal perspective using reference case recommendations from the Panel on cost-effectiveness in health and medicine. A state transition Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy for non-screening versus various screening strategies for ASIL and anal SCC using Pap smears ( Pap) anal at different intervals. Values of incidence, progression and regression of anal neoplasia""; effectiveness of screening and treatment; natural history of HIV; quality of life related to health""; and costs were obtained from the literature. Setting and participants Hypothetical cohort of HIV-positive gay and bisexual men living in the United States. Main outcome measures Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years saved, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Results Screening for ASIL increased quality-adjusted life expectancy at all stages of HIV disease. Screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years, beginning in the early stages of HIV disease (CD4 cell count >0.50 ¡Ã 109/L), resulted in a 2.7-month increase in life expectancy of quality-adjusted life for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Annual screening with anal Pap smears provided an additional benefit at an incremental cost of $16,600 per quality-adjusted life year saved. If screening was not started until later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count <0.50¡Ã109/L), then yearly Pap smear was preferred due to increased amount of disease prevalent anal (cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $25,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved compared with no screening). Screening every 6 months provided a small additional benefit over annual screening. The results were most sensitive to the rate of progression from ASIL to anal SCC and the effectiveness of treatment of precancerous lesions. Conclusions Screening for ASIL and anal SCC in HIV-positive gay and bisexual men with anal Pap smears offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to other accepted preventive clinical interventions.",0,0,
1740,The clinician-researcher: inevitable but manageable tension,"The ""difference position"" holds that clinical research and therapeutic medical practice are sufficiently different activities to require different rules and ethical principles. Instead, the ""similarity position"" holds that clinical investigators should be bound by the same fundamental principles that govern therapeutic medicine, specifically, the duty to provide the optimal therapeutic benefit to each patient or subject. Some advocates of the similarity position defend it because of the overlap between the role of the treating physician and the role of the investigator in a research trial. This overlap is greatest when the same physician occupies both roles with respect to a particular patient-subject. We address the ethical tensions inherent in such role conflict and argue that the tensions are real but manageable. The difference position provides a solid ethical framework within which to manage these tensions, while the similarity position is unsatisfactory because it seeks to deny the existence of the tensions.",0,0,
1741,The CLUES study: a cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate the implementation of cardiovascular guidelines in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Appropriate care for people with cardiovascular risk factors can reduce morbidity and mortality. One strategy to improve the care of these patients involves the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. To date, little research has been published on the impact of these implementation strategies in our setting. Goals. To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted personalized intervention in the implementation of three guidelines related to cardiovascular risk (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia) in primary care in the Basque Health Service compared to the usual implementation. METHODS/DESIGN: Two-year cluster randomized clinical trial in primary care in two districts of the Basque Health Service. All primary care units are randomized. The data of all diabetic, hypertensive and susceptible to coronary risk screening will be analyzed. Interventions. The control group will receive the standard implementation. The experimental group will receive a multifaceted personalized implementation strategy, including a specific web page and workshops for family doctors and nurses. Evaluation criteria. Primary endpoints: annual request for glycosylated hemoglobin, basic laboratory tests for hypertension, cardiovascular risk screening (women between 45-74 and men between 40-74 years). Secondary variables: other process indicators and clinical guidelines. ANALYSIS: The data will be extracted from the centralized computerized clinical history. The ANALYSIS will be carried out at the primary care unit level weighted by cluster size. DISCUSSION: The main contribution of our study is that it aims to identify an effective strategy for the implementation of cardiovascular guidelines in primary care in our environment.

1742,The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program: A High Plains Research Network Practice Training Intervention,"INTRODUCTION: Asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program was initiated to establish a method for improving asthma care by providing primary care practices with guidance, training, and support for (1) evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of asthma, and (2) patient education and activation for effective care. self-management of your illness. METHODS: A collaborative program involving 2 academic medical institutions and the High Plains Research Network, a primary care practice-based research network in eastern Colorado, was initiated. Focus groups were conducted with rural Colorado patients and health care physicians to assess the need and determine the most effective intervention strategies. Two interrelated training programs, or ""tool kits,"" were subsequently developed, one for each of the healthcare physicians and patients. Physicians received 3 training sessions conducted by 2 nurse practitioners that included training in guideline-based methods for the assessment and treatment of asthma, training to assist practices in implementing these methods, and training in communication techniques for promote self-control of asthma. A spirometer was also delivered to the practices and they were trained in its use and interpretation. Patient self-management toolkits were provided to clinicians, who were trained to use the materials to educate patients and increase treatment adherence. Evaluations were based on practice interviews 1 to 3 months after training. RESULTS: Training occurred in 57 of 58 primary care offices in rural and semi-rural areas of eastern Colorado. Practices reported changes in their asthma management behaviors: (1) 40.4% of practices increased their use of inhaled corticosteroids, and the median percentage of patients taking inhaled corticosteroids increased from 25% to 50%""; (2) 53.2% of practices increased their use of asthma action plans, with the median percentage of patients with action plans increasing from 0% to 20%;"" and (3) 78.7% of practices started or increased their use of spirometry, resulting in an increase in median use from 0% to 30%. CONCLUSION: The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program successfully delivered asthma care training to most rural health care practices in the area. Acceptance by practices was attributed to flexible office training and provision of spirometry. The significant changes observed in asthma management practices are likely to reduce hospitalizations and emergency department visits.",0,0,
1743,The Community Physicians Network (CPN): an academic-community partnership to eliminate health care disparities,"INTRODUCTION: Disparities in health care are maintained by three main factors: 1) patient factors that include multiple risk factors and comorbidities""; 2) health professional factors that include inconsistent application of practice guidelines due to a limited database of clinical trials of effective therapies in African Americans and other underrepresented minorities, and 3) barriers in the health care delivery system that result in poor access to care The Community Physician Network ( CPN) at Morehouse School of Medicine was established to address health care disparities by focusing on provider-specific strategies OBJECTIVES: To: 1) use disease-specific registries to identify treatment gaps and facilitate care improvement processes quality among CPN practices; 2) develop specific educational messages practice-specific and guideline-based to promote quality of care; 3) engage and train NPC clinicians to participate in clinical protocols approved by the NIH, other governments, and industry; and 4) develop a data repository of all CPN-sponsored clinical trials that include significant numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented minorities. METHODS: Disease-specific outpatient registries will have the following characteristics: 1) data structures and data elements will use standard database codes and a data dictionary; 2) HIPAA compliant data transfer and extraction tool; 3) reference chart review to establish practice patterns and provide practice-specific feedback; 4) annual update of the registry; 5) registration and data repository maintained on the secure servers of the Morehouse School of Medicine; 6) registry publications will include only aggregated data, without identification of contributing practices; 7) An electronic medical record platform will be promoted as the ultimate data management tool for NPC practices. Additionally, up to three continuing medical education (CME) programs each year will feature national speakers and promote evidence-based practice guidelines. RESULTS: Eighty-five primary care and subspecialty practices are actively enrolled in CPN with a total of 385,000 annual outpatient visits. The composition of the insurance status is: HMO/PPO (45%); Medicare only (19%); Medicare HMO (11%); Medicare plus (8%); Medicaid (6%);"" Uninsured (11%).

Design Dynamic mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression, and cost-effectiveness analysis. in the US Time horizon 20 years and life (costs and QALYs). Society perspective. Interventions Expanded HIV screening and counselling, ART treatment, or both. Outcomes New HIV infections, reduced costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness Rationale. Outcomes Base-case analysis One-time HIV screening in low-risk individuals along with annual HIV screening high risk in high risk people. Individuals could prevent 6.7% of the projected 1.23 million new infections and cost $22,382/QALY gained, assuming a 20% reduction in post-screening sexual activity. Expanding ART use to 75% of eligible people prevents 10.3% of infections and costs $20,300/QALY earned. A combined strategy prevents 17.3% of infections and costs $21,580/QALY gained.

Measures: quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost. effectiveness. Results: Annual Pap smear resulted in a gain of 2.1 months in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost of $12,800 per QALY saved. Annual Pap smear testing after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart provided an additional 0.04 QALYs at a cost of $14,800 per QALY saved. The biannual Pap smear test provided an additional 0.17 QALYs at a cost of $27,600 per QALY saved. Annual colposcopy cost more but provided no additional benefit compared to biannual Pap smear, and biannual colposcopy exceeded $375,000 per QALY saved. The results were more sensitive to the rate of progression of the neoplasm to invasive cancer. Conclusions: In HIV-infected women, screening for cervical cancer with annual Pap smears after two negative smears obtained 6 months apart offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to that of other screening tests. preventive clinical interventions.",0,0,
1748,The current situation of research and health ethics in Sudan,"In the early 20th century, health research in Sudan developed mainly as a function of the British colonial administration. The ethical issues of the medical profession in the Sudan are governed by the Sudan Medical Council. To address these issues, the Sudanese Medical Council issued Medico-Legal and Ethical Guidelines in 1967. This important document has focused primarily on ethical issues arising in clinical medicine. Throughout the history of health research in Sudan it is very difficult to find any reference to research ethics. However, there have been some attempts to articulate ethics in health research. In 1979, Sudan witnessed the establishment of the first ethics review committee, which was established at the initiative of a group of doctors and scientists from the national health research laboratory. This committee did not obtain political or institutional recognition. Therefore, it was not developed and came to an end shortly after its creation. However, in 2000, FMOH established an ethical review committee (ERC). The functions of this committee were to review the health research proposals to be carried out in the country for ethical reasons, regardless of the financing agents. Unfortunately, the committee spent all of its work reviewing only externally sponsored health research and research conducted by expatriate researchers or international organizations.",0,0,
1749,Demonstration of a theory-based approach to the design of localized patient safety interventions.,"Background There is evidence of unsafe care in health systems worldwide. Interventions to implement recommended practice often have modest and variable effects. Ideally, selecting and adapting interventions according to local contexts should enhance effects. However, the means by which this can happen are rarely systematic, based on theory, or made transparent. This work aimed to demonstrate the applicability, feasibility, and acceptability of a Theoretical Domains Framework Implementation (TDFI) approach to co-design patient safety interventions. Methods We worked with three hospitals to support the implementation of evidence-based guidance to reduce the risk of feeding through misplaced nasogastric feeding tubes. Our tiered process, informed by the TDF and key principles of the implementation literature, involved: ""engaging stakeholders""; identifying target behaviors; identifying local factors (barriers and levers) that affect behavior change using a questionnaire based on TDF, work with stakeholders to bring about targeted local changes strategies to address key barriers and support to stakeholders to implement strategies Exit interviews and audit data collection were conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach Results After audit and discussion, the implementation teams of each trust identified the process of verifying the placement of nasogastric tubes before feeding as the key behavior for the objective The results of the questionnaire indicated differences in the key barriers between the or organizations. The focus groups generated innovative, generalizable, and adaptable strategies to overcome barriers, such as awareness events, screen savers, equipment modifications, and interactive learning resources. rces. Exit interviews identified issues related to the benefits, challenges, and sustainability of this approach. Time trend audit data was collected for 301 patients over an 18-month period for a Trust, suggesting clinically significant improvement in pH use and practice documentation post-intervention. Conclusions The TDF is a feasible and acceptable framework to guide the implementation of patient safety interventions. The stepped TDFI approach engages health professionals and facilitates contextualization in identifying the target behavior, eliciting local barriers, and selecting strategies to address those barriers. This approach may be useful for implementation teams and policymakers, although our promising findings confirm the need for more rigorous evaluation; a balanced block assessment is currently underway.",0,1,
1750,The design and evaluation of a graphic display for laboratory data.,"Purpose Advances in health care information technology have provided opportunities to present data in new and more effective ways. In this study, we designed a lab display that presents small, data-dense graphs called sparklines, which have recently been touted as effective representations of medical data but have not been well studied. The effect of this new screen on clinicians' interpretation of the data was investigated. Design Twelve physicians spoke aloud while evaluating laboratory data from four patients in a pediatric intensive care unit with the graphical display and a conventional tabletop display. Measurements Verbalizations were coded based on abnormal values and trends identified for each laboratory variable. The correspondence of the interpretations of the variables in each screen was evaluated and the patterns between the participants were investigated. The evaluation time was also analyzed. Results Physicians completed assessments significantly faster with the graphic display (3.6 min vs. 4.4 min, p=0.042). When compared between screens, 37% of interpretations did not match. The charts were most useful when the visual cues in the charts did not provide trend information, while slightly abnormal values were easier to identify with the charts. Conclusions The data presentation format may affect the way clinicians interpret laboratory data. Graphic displays have several advantages over numeric displays, but they are not always optimal. The characteristics of the user, the task and the data must be taken into account when designing information screens.",0,1,
1751,The development of an intervention to promote adherence to national guidelines for suspected viral encephalitis,"BACKGROUND: Central nervous system infections can have devastating clinical outcomes if not diagnosed and treated early. There is a documented gap between recommended and actual practice and a limited understanding of its causes. We identify and explore the reasons for this gap, focusing on the points in the patient's journey most amenable to change and developing a personalized intervention strategy to improve diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Using semi-structured interviews with theoretical information, we explored the barriers and facilitators to diagnosing and managing patients with suspected encephalitis, specifically performing lumbar punctures and initiating antiviral therapy within 6 h. We intentionally take samples from hospitals and hospital staff in the UK. We audio recorded and transcribed all interviews prior to frame analysis. We map the barriers and facilitators identified in the patient's journey. We combine clinician-targeted behavior change techniques with leading barriers and facilitators and integrate them into an intervention package. RESULTS: We interviewed 43 staff members at six hospitals. Clinical staff expressed uncertainty about when and how to perform lumbar punctures, highlighting the practical difficulties of performing lumbar punctures in busy clinical settings. Once the need for treatment was triggered, clinicians generally felt able to take appropriate therapeutic action, albeit within organizational and resource constraints. Combined behavior change techniques focused largely on treatment history. These included decision support for rapid recognition, highlighting the consequences of missed diagnoses for clinicians and patients, and practical support for lumbar punctures. We then designed an evidence-based package comprising ""core"" interventions and, to allow for local flexibility, ""optional"" interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several points in the patient journey where the practice could improve, the most critical being around clinical suspicion and initial investigation. Interventions targeting professional beliefs and behaviors while optimizing their clinical environment are among the most promising approaches for improving the care of suspected encephalitis.

1753,The development of evidence-based psychotherapy for use in alcoholism. A review,"The past decades have seen tremendous progress in the development and validation of evidence-based approaches to psychotherapy for alcoholism. While early behavioral and psychoanalytic techniques were the original foundation of psychotherapy in this field, evidence-based approaches are now based on the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy.

1755,The economy-wide impact of pandemic influenza in the UK: a computable general equilibrium modeling experiment,"OBJECTIVES To estimate the potential economic impact of pandemic influenza, associated behavioral responses, school closures and vaccination in the UK. DESIGN A computable general equilibrium model of the UK economy was specified for various combinations of pandemic influenza mortality and morbidity, vaccine efficacy, school closures, and prophylactic absenteeism using published data. ADJUSTMENT 2004 UK economy (most up-to-date available with adequate economic data). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The economic impact of various scenarios with different pandemic severity, vaccination, school closures, and prophylactic absenteeism specified in terms of gross domestic product, output of different economic sectors, and equivalent variation. RESULTS Costs related to disease alone ranged from 0.5% to 1.0% of gross domestic product (£8.4bn to £16.8bn) for low-mortality scenarios, 3.3% and 4.3% ( £55.5bn to £72.3bn) for high-mortality scenarios, and larger still for an extreme pandemic. School closures increase the economic impact, particularly for mild pandemics. If there is widespread behavior change and large-scale prophylactic sick leave, the economic impact would be markedly increased with little health benefit. Vaccination with a pre-pandemic vaccine could save 0.13% to 2.3% of gross domestic product (£2.2bn to £38.6bn)""; a single dose of a combination vaccine could save 0 .3% to 4.3% (from 5 billion to 72 pounds sterling). 3 billion);"" and two doses of a compatible vaccine could limit the overall economic impact to about 1% of gross domestic product for all disease scenarios. CONCLUSION Balancing school closures with ""business as usual"" and obtaining sufficient supplies of effective vaccines are more important factors in determining the economic impact of an influenza pandemic than the disease itself. Prophylactic absence from work in response to fear of infection can greatly increase the economic impact.",0,0,

Measurements Rates of objectively confirmed symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and death attributable to venous thromboembolism occurring within 90 days of the date of surgery. Results Pre- and post-intervention cohorts did not differ with respect to age, disease severity, number of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, or individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The overall prophylaxis rate increased from 89.9% before implementation of the computerized reminder system to 95.0% after implementation (p < 0.0001).

Forty of 46 venous thromboembolic complications (87%) occurred despite the application of the measures recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians to prevent venous thromboembolism. Conclusions Computerized reminder systems combined with altered care procedures increase the rate of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis without decreasing the rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism when the initial prophylaxis rate is high. There is a population of surgical patients who are resistant to the prophylactic measures against venous thromboembolism recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians.

1759,The Effect of a Patient-Centered Care Package Intervention on Pressure Ulcer Incidence (INTACT): A Cluster-Randomized Trial,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers are a serious patient safety concern, associated with poor patient outcomes and high healthcare costs. They are also seen as an indicator of the quality of nursing care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer prevention care package in preventing hospital-acquired pressure ulcers among patients at risk. DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster randomized trial. SETTING: Eight tertiary referral hospitals with >200 beds each in three Australian states. PARTICIPANTS: 1600 patients (200/hospital) were recruited. Patients were eligible if they were: >/= 18 years of age; risk of pressure ulcer due to limited mobility; they were expected to stay in the hospital >/= 48 hours and could read English. METHODS: Hospitals (groups) were stratified into two groups by recent pressure ulcer rates and randomly assigned within strata to a package of care for pressure ulcer prevention or standard care. The care package was theoretically and empirically based on patient participation and clinical practice guidelines. It had multiple components, with three messages for patients. participation in pressure ulcer prevention care: keep moving, take care of your skin and eat a healthy diet. Patient training aids included a DVD, brochure, and poster. Nurses in intervention hospitals were trained to collaborate with patients in their pressure ulcer prevention care. The statistician, recruiters, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment, and the interventionists were blinded to the study hypotheses, tested in both group and patient. speed The primary outcome, the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers, which was applied at both the group and individual participant levels, was measured by daily skin inspection. RESULTS: Four groups were randomized to each group and 799 patients per group were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.035. After adjusting for clustering and prespecified covariates (age, pressure ulcer present at baseline, body mass index, reason for admission, residence, and number of comorbidities at admission), the hazard ratio for new pressure ulcers was developed. (package of care for pressure ulcer prevention relative to standard care) was 0.58 (95% CI 0.25, 1.33, p = 0.198). No adverse events or harms were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pressure ulcer prevention care package was associated with a large reduction in the risk of pressure ulceration, there was a high degree of uncertainty surrounding this estimate and the difference was not statistically significant. Possible explanations for this Non-significant findings include that the pressure ulcer prevention care package was effective but the sample size was too small to detect.",0,0,
1760,The effect of adding Pap smear information to a mammography reminder system in an HMO: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Although reminders can promote cancer screening in primary care, little is known about the potential interaction between multiple reminders. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of Pap smears combined with mammogram recalls and mammogram recalls alone among 2,471 women aged 40 years and older enrolled in a health maintenance organization serving a predominantly eligible population. Medicaid. The reminders included both a letter mailed to the woman and a medical record notice. Results Intervention allocation was not associated with differences in rates of visits to family medicine or internal medicine or mammograms during the study year. Compared with women assigned to mammography recall treatment alone, those assigned to the combined mammography recall and Pap smear intervention were more likely to visit a gynecologist (34% vs. 29%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.08). “1.63) and completing a Pap smear (30% compared with 23%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.07–1.89). Conclusions Within the study setting, the addition of Pap smears to mammography reminders has a procedure-specific effect, increasing gynecology visits and Pap smear use without increasing or decreasing other primary care or mammography visits. We found no evidence of reinforcement or competition between these reminders.",0,1,
1761,The effect of computerized reminders on the prescribing behavior of general practitioners: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: It is difficult to monitor drug prescribing behavior in general practice, despite the development and distribution of guidelines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on medication prescription behavior of the implementation of prescription guidelines through a computerized reactive reminder system (CRS). DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial with incomplete block design in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about prescriptions for antibiotics and asthma/COPD, 28 GPs (7 GP consultations) received reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescription guidelines were integrated into the computerized GP information system. MEASUREMENTS: Both performance indicators and prescription volumes were calculated as the main outcome measures. Along with the individual volume measure, total scores were constructed on the volume measures by drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD, and cholesterol). RESULTS: The variation among general practitioners was found to be larger and more biased than expected. No differences were found between groups for the indicators and volumes related to the recommendations that advocate certain medications. Although there was a trend towards clinically relevant outcomes for prescription volumes that were supposed to decrease, the difference in total score between groups was not significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that were supposed to decrease, the total score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8-44.5) prescriptions per 1,000 patients per GP, while for the control group it was 39.7 (95% CI: 29.7-64.1). group (p 0.2). For asthma/COPD prescriptions that were supposed to decrease, the total score for the intervention group was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6-2.6) prescriptions per 1,000 patients per GP, while which was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4-4.3) for the control group (p 0.1). In three specific recommendations (on quinolones for cystitis, corticosteroids for COPD and antibiotics for acute sore throat) significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: This study was found to be underpowered due to high inter-physician variation in prescribing behavior. However, computerized reminders sometimes have a favorable effect in restricting certain drugs that are not or are no longer indicated in general practice.",1,1,
1762,The effect of the educational intervention on the registration of medical diagnoses among residents,"INTRODUCTION: Studies indicate that the use of interventions that include education can improve medical record documentation and reduce incomplete files. Since physicians play a crucial role in documenting medical records, the researchers intend to examine the effect of the educational intervention on physicians' performance and knowledge of the principles of medical diagnostic recording among residents of the Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2010 on 40 specialty residents (from the specialties of internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, anesthesiology, and surgery) at Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. During a workshop, guidelines were given for recording diagnostic information related to the given specialty. Before and after the intervention, five medical records were selected from each resident to assess the physician's performance in documenting medical records. Through a questionnaire, the knowledge of the doctors before and after the intervention was investigated. The data was analyzed through the one-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: The change in doctors' knowledge before and after education was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). The behavior of the residents did not have statistically significant changes during the three phases of the study. CONCLUSION: The diversity of related factors that contribute to the quality of the documentation forces the portfolio of strategies to improve the clinical history. Employing a combination of best practice efforts, including educating clinicians from the beginning of the internship and applying a specific strategy focus on problem areas and existing gaps, can improve clinicians' behavior on documentation of medical records.",0,0,
1763,The effect of external feedback in the management of hospitalized Medicare patients with congestive heart failure,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of 2 feedback strategies on compliance with congestive heart failure (CHF) guidelines. Thirty-two hospitals in 4 states were randomized to receive either a written feedback intervention (low-intensity intervention [LII]) or an intervention that includes feedback, a physician liaison, and quality improvement tools (high-intensity intervention [HII]). ]). CHF quality indicators were evaluated and quality managers were interviewed at baseline and remeasurement. No significant changes in quality indicators were found as a result of any of the interventions. Seventy-eight percent of quality managers indicated that implementation of the hospital project had not started until shortly before the remeasurement. HII quality managers perceived the CHF project as significantly more successful compared to LII quality managers (63% versus 13%, P < .01). Assessing the effects of external feedback on practice behavior requires sufficient time for organizational and individual clinical change to occur. Medical liaisons can play a role in facilitating this change.",0,1,
1764,The effect of mobile phone text message reminders on Kenyan health workers' adherence to malaria treatment guidelines: a cluster-randomized trial.,"Background Malaria case management practices of healthcare workers often differ from national guidelines. We evaluated whether text message reminders sent to health workers' mobile phones could improve and maintain their adherence to treatment guidelines for outpatient pediatric malaria in Kenya. Methods From March 6, 2009, to May 31, 2010, we conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial at 107 rural health facilities in 11 coastal and western districts of Kenya. Using a computer-generated sequence, health facilities were randomly assigned to the intervention group, in which all health workers received text messages on their personal mobile phones about malaria case management for 6 months, or to the control group, in which health workers did not receive any text messages. The health workers were not blinded to the intervention, although the patients did not know whether they were in an intervention or control center. The primary outcome was correct management with artemether-lumefantrine, defined as a dichotomous composite indicator of treatment, dispensing, and counseling tasks according to Kenyan national guidelines. The primary analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN72328636. Findings 119 health workers received the intervention. Case management practices were assessed for 2,269 children in need of treatment (1,157 in the intervention group and 1,112 in the control group). The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the correct handling of artemether-lumefantrine improved by 23 7 percentage points (95% CI 7 6–40 0""; p=0 004) immediately after the intervention and at 24 5 percentage points -points (8 1-41 0;"" p=0 003) 6 months later. Interpretation In resource-limited settings, malaria control programs should consider the use of text messaging to improve the case management practices of health workers.",1,1,

DESIGN: Single center randomized controlled trial with random assignment of referral guidelines for orthodontic treatment to general dentists. SETTING: Hospital orthodontic departments and specialist orthodontic clinics in Manchester and Stockport. SUBJECTS: General dentists and patients referred for orthodontic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Appropriateness of referral, defined as whether the patient was accepted for orthodontic treatment. RESULTS: Referral guidelines did not reduce the number of inappropriate referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Referral guidelines for orthodontic referrals did not influence the behavior of general dentists.

1766,The effect of record-based performance feedback via short text messages and traditional postal letters on parenteral steroid prescription by general practitioners: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background It is conjectured that providing feedback on physicians' prescribing behavior improves the quality of drug prescriptions. However, the effectiveness of feedback provision and the mode of feedback delivery are not well understood. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effect of traditional text messages (TPL) and short text messages (STM) on the parenteral steroid (PS) prescription behavior of general practitioners. Methods In a single-blind randomized controlled trial, 906 general practitioners (GPs) who had at least 10 monthly prescriptions were randomly recruited into two intervention and one control study arms with 1:1 allocation, stratified by percentage of prescriptions. The intervention consisted of the provision of 3 feedback messages containing prescription rates in TPL and STM (in the first two arms) versus the control arm (CG) with an interval of 3 months between these messages. We calculated the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) of PS for each GP, each month, and compared between the 3 arms, before and after the interventions. The primary expected outcome was to reduce participants' prescription of parenteral steroids. The study was conducted at the Kerman Social Security Organization in Iran. Results A total of 906 GPs were selected for the trial, but only 721 of them (TPL = 191, STM = 228, CG = 302) were recruited for the first feedback. The average age of the GPs was 44 years and 59% of them were men. The DDDs of parenteral steroids prescribed at baseline were similar (TPL = 121.62, STM = 127.49, CG = 115.68, P > 0.5). At the end of the study, the DDDs in the TPL and STM arms were similar (TPL = 104.38, STM = 101.90, P > 0.9), but the DDDs in each intervention arm were statistically significantly lower than in each intervention arm. CG (CG = 156.17, P < 0.0001). ). Being in the TPL and STM arms resulted in a 36.1 and 41.7 unit decrease in DDD, respectively, compared to the control arm (P < 0.02 and P < 0.005) after the one year duration of the study. Conclusion Feedback from TPLs and STMs on prescribing performance effectively reduced PS prescribing by GPs. STM, being a cheap and fast tool, is potentially powerful and efficient for drug prescription rationalization.",1,1,

DESIGN Best case analysis using a Markov model. SETTING Australian Study of Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle. PARTICIPANTS 2013 hypertensive people who met criteria for metabolic syndrome, with no history of cardiovascular disease and who did not receive antihypertensive treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Treatment effects associated with dark chocolate consumption derived from published meta-analyses were used to determine the absolute number of cardiovascular events with and without treatment. Costs associated with cardiovascular events and treatments were applied to determine the potential amount of funding required for dark chocolate therapy to be considered cost-effective. RESULTS Daily consumption of dark chocolate (polyphenol content equivalent to 100 g of dark chocolate) can reduce cardiovascular events by 85 (95% confidence interval 60 to 105) per 10,000 population treated for 10 years. $A40 (£25""; Ã¢â€šÂ¬31;"" $42) could be profitably spent per person per year on prevention strategies using dark chocolate.

1769,The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological treatments delivered by lay counselors for harmful and dependent drinking and moderate to severe depression in primary care in India: PREMIUM study protocol for randomized controlled trials,"BACKGROUND: The leading mental health causes of the global burden of disease are depression in women and alcohol use disorders in men. A major obstacle to the implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments in primary care in developing countries is the lack of availability of qualified human resources. The aim of these trials is to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two psychological treatments developed for the treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders in primary care in India. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for parallel group randomized controlled trials (Healthy Activity Program for Moderate to Severe Depression, Counseling for Harmful and Dependent Drinking Alcohol Problems) in eight primary health centers in Goa, India. . Adult primary care attendees will be screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and, in men only, the Alcohol Use Disorder Screening Test for problem drinking. Attendees who test positive will be invited to participate; men who test positive for both disorders will be invited to participate in the Alcohol Problem Counseling trial. Those who consent will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive the respective psychological treatment plus enhanced usual care or enhanced usual care only using a computer-generated allocation sequence stratified by primary health center and, for depression, by sex. treatments will be administered by lay counsellors, for a maximum period of three months Primary outcomes are severity of disorder and remission rates at three months after enrollment and, for the alcohol counseling trial, Alcohol use and the impact of alcohol use on daily life Secondary outcomes include disorder severity and remission rates at 12 months, disability scores, suicidal behavior and economic impact, and cost-effectiveness at three and 12 months. months. 500 participants with depression and 400 participants with harmful use of alcohol will be recruited. Primary analyzes will be by intention to treat. DISCUSSION: These trials may offer a new approach to the treatment of moderate to severe depression and problem drinking in primary care that is potentially scalable as it relies on the provision of a single group of lay counsellors.

1770,"The Efficacy of a Published Information Package on the Beliefs and Behavior of Musculoskeletal Professionals: The UK Musculoskeletal Chiropractors, Osteopaths and Physiotherapists Low Back Pain Management (COMPLEMENT) Randomized Trial","STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a printed information pack on low-back pain (LBP)-related beliefs and reported behavior of musculoskeletal professionals (chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physiotherapists) across the UK. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A substantial proportion of musculoskeletal clinicians in the UK do not follow current LBP guideline recommendations. METHODS: In total, 1758 physicians were randomly assigned to either of the 2 study arms. One arm was sent a printed information packet containing the guideline recommendations for the management of low back pain (n = 876) and the other received no intervention (n = 882). The primary outcome measure consisted of 3 'quality indicators' (activity, work and bed rest) related to a vignette of a patient with low back pain, in which responses were dichotomized into 'inconsistent with guidelines' or 'consistent with the guidelines. The secondary outcome was practitioners' low back pain-related beliefs, as measured by the Healthcare Providers' Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale. Outcomes were measured at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: Follow-up at 6 months was 89%. Changes in behavior reported on quality indicators were as follows: activity, odds ratio (OR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.61), and number needed to treat (NNT) , 19 (15-28)""; work, OR 1.35 (1.07-1.70) and NNT 19 (14-29) and bed rest, OR 1.31 (0.97-1.76) and NNT 47 (33-103) -Consistent behavior in at least 1 of the 3 quality indicators was 10 (9-14). information (P = 0.002), but only to a small degree (mean difference, 0.884 scale points; 95% confidence interval, 0.319-1.448).

1771,"Efficacy of an intervention to increase the delivery of preventive care by community health clinicians: a study protocol from a nonrandomized, multiple-base trial.","BACKGROUND: The leading behavioral risks for the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in developed countries are smoking, poor nutrition, hazardous alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Evidence, guidelines and policies support the provision of routine health care to prevent these risks within primary care settings. Despite the potential offered by community health services for the provision of such preventive care, the limited evidence available suggests that it is provided at suboptimal levels. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic practice change intervention to increase the provision of routine physician preventive care in a community health service network. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-site study will be conducted involving all 56 community health facilities in a single health district in New South Wales, Australia. Facilities will be assigned to one of three administratively defined groups. A 12-month practice change intervention will be implemented at all facilities in each cluster to facilitate physician risk assessment of eligible clients, and provision of brief physician counseling and referral to those identified as ""at risk"". The intervention will be implemented in a non-random sequence in the three groups of facilities. Repeated cross-sectional measures of preventive care medical provision for four individual risks (smoking, poor nutrition, hazardous alcohol use, and physical inactivity) will be performed continuously for the three groups of facilities for 54 months through telephone interviews. Interviews will be conducted with randomly selected clients who have visited a community health facility in the past two weeks. Data collection will start 12 months before the implementation of the intervention in the first group and will continue for six months after the end of the intervention in the last group. As a secondary source of data, pre- and post-intervention telephone interviews will be conducted with randomly selected samples of physicians from each group of facilities to assess informed provision of preventive care and acceptability of the intervention and implementation of practice change. DISCUSSION: The study will provide novel evidence regarding the ability to increase the provision of routine preventive physician care through a network of community health centers.

1772,The Efficacy of Computer Reminders in Improving Point-of-Care Test Quality Assessment in General Practice: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Computer reminders are increasingly being applied in an effort to improve quality and patient safety. However, research is still needed to establish the effectiveness of different types of reminders in various settings. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of computerized reminders in improving adherence to a quality assessment scheme for point-of-care testing in general practice. Method The study was conducted as a randomized controlled crossover trial among general practices in the Capital Region of Denmark. The intervention consisted of sending computerized reminders (ComRem) to the practices that did not adhere to the recommendations of the hemoglobin and glucose split test guideline. Practices were randomized into two groups. During the first follow-up period, one of the groups received the ComRem intervention together with the general implementation activities (GIA), while the other group received only the GIA. For the second follow-up period, the intervention was switched between the two groups. Results were measured as adherence to the split test procedure. Results A total of 142 practices were randomized to the early intervention group and 144 practices to the late intervention group (the control group at the first follow-up period). In the first intervention period, the mean number of split tests performed in the RemCom group increased from 1.22 to 3.76 (out of eight possible tests), while the mean number of split tests increased from 1.11 to 2.35 in the GIA target group only. (p = 0.0059). After crossover, a similar effect of reminders was observed. Furthermore, the evolution of the outcome measures over time showed a strong effect of computer reminders beyond the intervention periods. Conclusion There was a significant effect of computerized reminders on adherence to the quality assessment scheme for point-of-care tests. Therefore, computerized reminders appear to be useful in supporting the implementation of relatively simple procedures for quality and safety.",1,1,
1773,The effectiveness of computerized clinical guidelines in the care process: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed with the aim of improving the quality of care. The implementation of computerized clinical guidelines (CCG) has been supported by the development of computerized clinical decision support systems. This systematic review assesses the impact of CCG on the process of care compared to non-computerized clinical guidelines. METHODS: The specific characteristics of GCC were studied through an extensive search of the scientific literature, consulting electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association of GCC characteristics with a positive effect on the care process. RESULTS: Forty-five articles were selected. Logistic modeling showed that Automatic Provision of Electronic Recommendations as Part of Clinical Workflow (Odds Ratio [OR]= 17.5""; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.6-193.7) and Year of publication (OR = 6.7; ""95% CI: 1.3-34.3) were statistically significant predictors.

Our findings also suggest to physicians, managers, and other health care decision makers which features of CCG could improve the structure of the computerized system.",0,1,
1774,The effectiveness of interventions to improve laboratory request patterns among primary care physicians: a systematic review.,"Background Laboratory tests are an integral part of daily primary care practice, with approximately 30% of patient encounters resulting in a request. However, research suggests that a large proportion of requests is not in the best interest of patient care and is avoidable. The objective of this systematic review was to conduct a comprehensive search of the literature for studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve the use of laboratory tests by primary care physicians. Methods A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Scopus (from inception to 09/02/14) was performed. The following study designs were considered: systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series analyzes (ITS). Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) checklist. The population of interest was primary care physicians. Interventions were considered if they aimed to improve laboratory testing in primary care. The outcome of interest was a volume of laboratory tests. Results In total, 6,166 titles and abstracts were reviewed, followed by 87 full texts. Of these, 11 papers were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. This included four RCTs, six CBAs, and one ITS study. The types of interventions examined included education, feedback, cues, education with feedback, feedback with cues, and changing order forms. The quality of the included studies varied: seven studies were judged to be at low risk of bias, three at unclear risk of bias, and one at high risk of bias. All but one study found significant reductions in the volume of evidence after the intervention, with effect sizes ranging from 1.2% to 60%. Due to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not performed. Conclusions Interventions such as educational strategies, feedback and changing test request forms can improve the efficient use of laboratory tests in primary care"";"" however, the level of evidence is quite low and the quality is poor. The reproducibility of findings from different laboratories is also difficult to determine from the literature. Some standardization of both interventions and outcome measures is required to allow formal meta-analysis.",0,1,
1775,"The efficacy of SPARX, a computerized self-help intervention for adolescents seeking help for depression: a randomized controlled noninferiority trial.","OBJECTIVE To assess whether a new computerized cognitive behavioral therapy intervention (SPARX, Thinking Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, Factor X) could reduce depressive symptoms in help-seeking adolescents as much or more than treatment as usual. DESIGN Multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. SCENARIO 24 primary health care sites in New Zealand (youth clinics, general practices and school counseling services). PARTICIPANTS 187 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years seeking help for depressive symptoms, not at increased risk of self-harm, and deemed in need of treatment by their primary care physicians: 94 were assigned to SPARX and 93 to treatment as usual. INTERVENTIONS Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (SPARX) comprising seven modules administered over a period of between four and seven weeks, versus treatment as usual comprising primarily personal counseling provided by trained counselors and clinical psychologists. RESULTS The primary outcome was change in score on the Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised. Secondary outcomes included response and remission on the Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised, change scores on the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Rating Scale 2nd Edition, Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Kazdin Hopelessness for Children, Spence Childhood Anxiety Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life Satisfaction and Enjoyment Questionnaire, and Overall Satisfaction with Treatment ratings. RESULTS 94 participants were assigned to SPARX (mean age 15.6 years, 62.8% women) and 93 to treatment as usual (mean age 15.6 years, 68.8% women). 170 adolescents (91%, SPARX n=85, treatment as usual n=85) were evaluated post-intervention and 168 (90%, SPARX n=83, treatment as usual n=85) were evaluated at 3-month follow-up. Per-protocol analyzes (n = 143) showed that SPARX was non-inferior to treatment as usual. Post-intervention, there was a mean reduction of 10.32 in SPARX and 7.59 in treatment as usual in raw scores on the Childhood Depression Rating Scale-Revised (between-group difference 2.73, 95% confidence interval : -0.31 to 5.77""; P = 0.079) Remission rates were significantly higher in the SPARX arm (n = 31, 43.7%) than in the treatment-as-usual arm (n = 19, 26.4%) (difference 17.3%, 95% confidence interval 1.6% to 31.8%; P = 0.030) and response rates did not differ significantly between the SPARX arm (66.2%, n = 47) and the usual treatment arm (58.3%, n = 42) (difference 7.9%, -7.9% to 24%; P = 0.332).All secondary measures supported non-inferiority. Intention-to-treat analyzes confirmed these findings.The improvements were maintained at follow-up.The frequency of adverse events classified as ""possibly"" or ""probably"" related to the intervention did not differed between groups (SPARX n = 11""; usual treatment n = 11). CONCLUSIONS SPARX is a potential alternative to usual care for adolescents presenting with depressive symptoms in primary care settings and could be used to address some of the unmet demand for treatment.

1776,The effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary behavior in adults: protocol for a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: A physically active lifestyle plays a preventive role in the development of various chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Unfortunately, few adults achieve the minimum amount of physical activity and spend a lot of time sitting. The development of specific interventions to increase active life among adults is an important public health effort. A plausible context for reaching adults is the workplace. This systematic review aims to review the effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary behavior in the workplace. METHODS: A professional advisory group will work in collaboration with the research team to inform the systematic review and knowledge mobilization. Fifteen electronic databases will be searched to identify studies examining the effectiveness of workplace interventions on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. All experimental designs and observational studies (non-experimental intervention studies) that meet the study criteria will be included. Studies examining generally healthy, employed adult participants will be included in the review. Interventions will focus on increasing physical activity and/or decreasing sedentary behavior from the individual to the normative level. The primary outcome variables will be reported or observed physical activity and/or sedentary behavior in the workplace. Secondary outcomes will include variables ranging from return on investment to quality of life. Study quality will be assessed for risk of bias following the protocol identified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and supplemented by guidelines developed by the Cochrane Practice and Organization of Effective Care group, using RevMan. The quality of the evidence will be assessed using the recommendation classification, evaluation, development and evaluation approach. Where appropriate, meta-analyses, forest plots, and crop plots will be used to assess the direction, size, and consistency of intervention effect across studies using similar intervention strategies. Follow-up knowledge mobilization activities and products will be developed to support the use of this knowledge in practice. DISCUSSION: This protocol document describes a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of various types of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and decrease sedentary behavior at work. Collaboration with an advisory group of potential knowledge users throughout the process postulates a greater use and scope of the information obtained from this systematic review by knowledge users.

1777,The effects of a postgraduate course on the opioid prescribing patterns of general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to assess whether a single cancer palliative care workshop, which included medication prescription information, had an effect on general practitioners' opioid prescribing patterns in daily practice. METHOD: Opioid prescription figures for 68 general practitioners who had participated in the workshop were aggregated from the Regional Fund for Diseases computer system. Prescription figures for one year before and one year after the workshop were compared, and a control group of non-participants was included. RESULTS: This study showed limited effectiveness of a cancer palliative care workshop on morphine prescription figures for general practitioners in daily practice. This limited effect did not match the results of a pre- and post-workshop questionnaire that assessed the attitudes of the practitioners themselves.

1780,"The effects of maternal depression, anxiety, and perceived stress during pregnancy on preterm birth: a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Experiencing psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, or perceived stress during pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Clarifying the association between exposure and outcome may improve understanding of risk factors for prematurity and guide future clinical and research practices. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present review were to outline the evidence on the risk of preterm birth associated with antenatal depression, anxiety, and stress. METHODS: Four electronic database searches were conducted to identify published quantitative, population-based, multicenter cohort studies and randomized controlled trial studies focusing on the association between antenatal depression, anxiety and stress, and preterm birth. in English between 1980 and 2013 FINDINGS: Of 1469 electronically retrieved articles, 39 peer-reviewed studies met the final selection criteria and were included in this review following the PRISMA and MOOSE review guidelines. Information was extracted on the characteristics of the study"";"" depression, anxiety, and perceived stress were examined as separate and combined exposures. There is strong evidence that antenatal distress during pregnancy increases the likelihood of preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Complex pathways of significant interactions between depression, anxiety and stress, risk factors, and preterm birth were indicated both directly and indirectly. The effects of pregnancy distress were associated with spontaneous but not medically indicated preterm birth. Health professionals who provide perinatal care to women, such as obstetricians, midwives, nurses, and mental health specialists, should provide appropriate support to women experiencing psychological distress to improve outcomes for both mothers and children. for babies.",0,0,
1781,"The Effects of Pay-for-Performance Programs on Health, Health Care Use, and Care Processes","Background: The benefits of pay-for-performance (P4P) programs are uncertain. Purpose: To update and expand on a previous review examining the effects of P4P programs directed at the physician, group, manager, or institutional level on the process of care. and patient outcomes in outpatient and inpatient settings. Data sources: PubMed from June 2007 to October 2016""; MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Business Economics and Theory, Business Source Elite, Scopus, Faculty of 1000 and Gartner Research from June 2007 to February 2016. Selection of studies: Trials and observational studies in inpatient and outpatient settings reporting process of care, health, or utilization outcomes Data extraction: Two investigators extracted data, assessed study quality, and rated the strength of the evidence. Data Synthesis: Among 69 studies, 58 were conducted in outpatient settings, 52 reported process-of-care outcomes, and 38 reported patient outcomes. Low-strength evidence suggested that P4P programs in outpatient settings may improve pro- short-term (2 to 3 years) care cessation outcomes, while data on longer-term effects were limited. The positive studies were done in the UK, where incentives were higher than in the US. The greatest improvements were seen in areas where initial performance was poor. There was no consistent effect of P4P on intermediate health outcomes (low strength evidence) and insufficient evidence to characterize any effect on patient health outcomes. In the hospital setting, there was low-strength evidence that P4P had little or no effect on patient health outcomes and a positive effect in reducing hospital readmissions. Limitation: Few methodologically rigorous studies; heterogeneous population and characteristics of the program and incentive objectives. Conclusion: Pay-for-performance programs may be associated with better care processes in outpatient settings, but consistently positive associations with better health outcomes have not been shown in any setting.",0,0,
1782,The Effects of Price Information on Physicians' Test Ordering Behavior: Ordering Diagnostic Tests.,"This research evaluated the effects of providing clinicians with information about diagnostic test prices on their subsequent test-ordering behavior. The study population consisted of 36 second- and third-year residents and 23 clinical professors at three family medicine centers affiliated with the Department of Family Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan. Study participants were asked to review four case studies, each describing a patient with ambiguous symptoms, and to indicate on an attached test request form which tests they would order for each patient. Subjects were randomly assigned to a group that received test order forms on which diagnostic test prices were printed (price information group) or a group that received test order forms with no prices indicated (price information group). control). The results of the study show that for each of the four cases, the average number of diagnostic tests ordered was significantly lower in the price information group than in the control group. Our findings also show an average reduction in the cumulative cost of tests ordered per patient of 31.1 percent related to providing price information. The feasibility of regularly providing physicians with price information is discussed and reviewed in light of other approaches that have been developed to modify physician behavior when ordering diagnostic tests.",1,1,
1783,The effectiveness of an automated feedback system for general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: An automated feedback system was developed that produces feedback on general practitioners (GPs) non-adherence to accepted practice guidelines for ordering diagnostic tests. Before implementing the automated feedback system in daily practice, we evaluated the potential effect of the system on the test-ordering behavior of GPs. DESIGN: We used a randomized controlled trial with a balanced block design. SETTING: Five times six participating groups of GPs in a computer lab setting. INTERVENTION: GPs reviewed a random sample of 30 application forms that they completed earlier that year. If deemed necessary, they may make changes to the requested tests. The system then displayed critical comments about their non-compliance with the guidelines, as evident from the (updated) application forms. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four randomly selected physicians participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of diagnostic tests ordered (17% with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12-22%) and the fraction of tests ordered that were not in accordance with practice guidelines (39% with 95% CI: 28-51%) decreased due to feedback from the automated feedback system. Physicians accepted 362 (50%) of the 729 reminders. IMPLICATIONS: Although our experiment cannot predict the actual effect size of the automated feedback system in daily practice, the observed effect can be viewed as the maximum achievable.",1,1,
1784,The efficacy of computerized reminders in external quality assessment for point-of-care testing in Danish general practice: rationale and methodology for two randomized trials.,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care tests (POCT) are increasingly used in general practice to assist general practitioners (GPs) in the management of patients with disease. However, low adherence to quality guidelines in terms of split testing procedures has been observed among GPs in parts of the Capital Region of Denmark. Computerized reminders embedded in GPs' electronic medical records (RemComs) may facilitate improved quality control behaviour, but more research is needed to identify which types of reminders work and when. The general objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ComRem in improving compliance with quality guidelines by general practitioners. This article describes the rationale and study methods that constitute this research project. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is carried out as two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among general practices in two districts of the Capital Region of Denmark. These districts contain a total of 739 GPs in 567 practices with a total of 1.1 million patients assigned to practice rosters. In the first RCT (RCT A), ComRem is compared with reminder postcards. In the second RCT (RCT B), ComRem is compared with usual activities (without reminders) in a crossover approach. In both studies, outcomes are measured by the number of split tests received by the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the knowledge about the efficacy of ComRem in primary care. Since the study does not explore the perceptions and experiences of GPs regarding ComRem, we will later carry out a qualitative survey focused on these aspects.

1785,The efficacy of visual cues to improve hand hygiene compliance,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines governing the hand hygiene (HH) behavior of healthcare workers (HCWs) are well established. Despite the known dangers of healthcare-associated infections for both healthcare workers and patients, hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates remain appallingly low . To evaluate a potential solution to this ongoing challenge, we used a simulated patient encounter in an actual hospital room to test the efficacy of individual HH triggers. METHODS: One hundred fifty HCWs (75 physicians and 75 nurses) participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of five equal-sized groups. Each participant performed a standardized patient-focused physical examination and was expected to maintain HH before and after the examination. Using two rooms in a medical-surgical unit at a tertiary care university hospital, various signals were employed and the impact on HHC was recorded before and after the examination. In the control group, the hand sanitizer dispenser was in its usual location (Baseline). In one group, the dispenser was relocated to ""Line-of-Sight"" upon entering the room""; in another, flashing lights were placed on the dispenser in its usual location (Baseline & Flicker); and in a third group, the dispenser was relocated to line-of-sight and flashing lights (Line-of-Sight & Flicker) were placed. In the last group, a large warning sign (Warning Sign) was placed on the door, informing the health care provider that the room was under electronic surveillance and that failure to perform HHC would trigger an alarm Data were analyzed using a generalized linear model to perform repeated measures logistic regression, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTS:In the control group (baseline), the HHC rates before and after the examination were 36.7% and 33.3%, respectively.All interventions improved preintervention HHC compared to baseline (line of sight = 53.3%, baseline and flicker = 60%, line of sight and flicker = 66%, warning signal = 93.3%), but only Sight & Flicker line of sight and Warning Sign produced a statistically significant increase in pre-examination HHC (P = 0.022 and P < 0.001, respectively). Only the warning signal produced a statistically significant increase in HHC after examination (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Visual cues can improve HHC, but their efficacy varies. A warning signal reporting a surveillance system with subsequent reports of noncompliance resulted in the most significant improvement at HHC. The use of a standardized patient in an actual hospital room was a useful tool to assess the impact of various interventions designed to improve HHC and patient safety.",1,1,
1786,The use of ward opinion leaders for continuing education in the hospital.,"Opinion leaders (OLs) are members within a social group with significant social influence over others. Urinary catheter care guidance was introduced in three groups (A, B, and C) of two randomized wards. Two OLs per ward were identified by nurses from groups A and B, using a sociomemetic method. For education, in-service lectures were used for 30% of nurses and OL tutorials for all nurses in group A; OL tutorials at B, lectures at C, and ward nurses were in turn responsible for educating newcomers of student nurses. Before and After the educational program, the frequency of practicing the guideline was evaluated by surveying 30% of the randomly selected nurses and by direct observation of incorrect practices. A student questionnaire on the guide was also conducted. For the three measurement methods, the best results were in group A followed by B and C;"" and the differences for the three groups were significant (p<.05). This indicates that continuing education in the hospital can be carried out effectively by enlisting the OLs in the room.",1,1,
1787,The growing pandemics of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. A call to action for doctors,"Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are growing national and global epidemics that warrant increased attention from physicians and other health professionals. These intricately linked conditions are responsible for an enormous burden of chronic disease, impaired physical function and quality of life, at least 300,000 premature deaths, and at least $90 billion in direct health care costs annually in the United States alone. Physicians are on the front lines, but these conditions receive minimal attention during a typical office visit. Clinicians are often overwhelmed by these challenges, citing the absence of clear guidelines and practical tools, minimal training in behavior modification strategies, and lack of time as reasons not to address them. This report provides a ""call to action"" with step-by-step guidance specifically targeting the critical role of physicians and other health professionals in curbing these dangerous epidemics. Requiring only a few minutes of a clinician's time to implement, this action plan will facilitate more effective intervention related to obesity and inactivity and should have a favorable impact on public health.",0,0,
1788,The Esperance Primary Suicide Prevention Project,"BACKGROUND: Suicide has been a major community concern in Esperance, a geographically isolated port on the south coast of Western Australia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of three evidence-based initiatives for the primary prevention of suicide: (i) providing ""suicide awareness"" sessions for health, education, and social service staff members""; (ii) limiting the sale of pain relievers over-the-counter drugs (aspirin and acetaminophen) to packages containing less than the minimum lethal dose;"" and (iii) implement Commonwealth media guidelines on media reporting of suicides. METHODS: Changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, comfort, and use were assessed before and after each intervention, using standardized and pro forma instruments derived from previous work, such as the Suicide Prevention Training Manual. Juvenile and Suicide Intervention Belief Scale. Percentage changes in the number of retail outlets selling over-the-counter pain relievers in amounts less than life-threatening (less than 8 g of acetaminophen or aspirin) were also measured. Media representatives were interviewed for their perceptions of the Commonwealth Suicide Reporting Guidelines, and were encouraged to consult the project team before reporting on suicide-related issues. RESULTS: The baseline survey illustrated that mental health staff and general practitioners were more aware of suicide issues, suicide risk factors, and professional and ethical responses than staff from other services, and were more willing to raise the issue with a person at risk. . Thirty-three subjects participated in the suicide awareness training, of whom 21 (66%) answered questionnaires. There were significant increases in awareness of suicide-related issues and risk factors, as well as reported levels of knowledge of professional and ethical responses and levels of comfort, competence, and confidence in helping a person at risk. Only three media representatives were aware of the Commonwealth Department of Health Guidelines for reporting suicides and only one believed the guidelines influenced their reporting. Local newspapers subsequently contacted investigators to verify that their reporting complied with the guidelines. On access to painkillers, one in seven retailers agreed to implement the strategy (pending agreement from other retailers), another stated increased awareness of the danger of painkillers, and three said they would try to control excessive quantities sold to An individual. CONCLUSIONS: Local initiatives can improve the awareness and knowledge of staff in suicide risk assessment, as well as the local media. These should be complemented by Commonwealth or state level initiatives to bring about changes in state media or OTC painkiller sales.",0,0,
1789,The ethical evaluation of innovative therapies: living donor liver transplantation,"Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for many forms of liver disease. Unfortunately, the scarcity of cadaveric donor livers limits the availability of this technique. To improve liver transplant availability, surgeons have developed the ability to remove a portion of the liver from a living donor and transplant it into a recipient. Some living donor liver transplants have been performed around the world. Our purpose was to review the ethics of living-donor liver transplants and to propose guidelines for the procedure prior to its introduction in the United States. We use a ""research ethics consultation"" process that involves a collaboration between clinical investigators and clinical ethicists. We concluded that it was ethically appropriate to perform a living-donor liver transplant in a small series of patients on a trial basis, and published our ethical guidelines in a medical journal before the procedure was introduced. We recommend this prospective and public approach to the introduction of other innovative therapies in medicine and surgery.",0,0,

1791,The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guideline on the treatment and prevention of suicide,"UNLABELED: Suicide is a major public health problem in the WHO European Region, causing more than 150,000 deaths a year. Suicidal crisis: Acute intervention must begin immediately to keep the patient alive. DIAGNOSIS: An underlying psychiatric disorder is present in up to 90% of people who commit suicide. Comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and personality disorders is high. For successful prevention of suicidality, proper diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment for the underlying disorder are essential. TREATMENT: Existing evidence supports the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the prevention of suicidal behaviour. Some other psychological treatments show promise, but the evidence supporting them is currently insufficient. Studies show that antidepressant treatment decreases the risk of suicide among depressed patients. However, the risk of suicidal behavior in depressed patients treated with antidepressants exists during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Short-term complementary medication with anxiolytics and hypnotics is recommended in case of anxiety and insomnia. TREATMENT of children and adolescents with antidepressants should only be carried out under the supervision of a specialist. Long-term treatment with lithium has been shown to be effective in preventing both suicide and attempted suicide in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Clozapine TREATMENT is effective in reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics show promise, but more evidence is needed. TREATMENT Team: Multidisciplinary treatment teams that include psychiatrist and other professionals such as psychologist, social worker and occupational therapist are always preferable, as the integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended, especially for patients with chronic suicidal tendencies. Family: The suicidal person regardless of age should always be motivated to involve the family in treatment. Social support: Treatment and psychosocial support are recommended, as most suicidal patients have problems with relationships, work, school, and lack functioning social networks. SAFETY: A safe home, public and hospital environment, without access to suicide means, is a necessary strategy in suicide prevention. Each treatment option, medication prescription, and patient discharge from the hospital must be carefully weighed against the risks involved. Staff training: General practitioner (GP) training is effective in suicide prevention. It improves the treatment of depression and anxiety, the quality of care provided and attitudes towards suicide. Continuing education that includes discussions of ethical and legal issues is necessary for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.",0,0,
1792,The evaluation of a personalized intervention to improve the management of suspected viral encephalitis: protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial,"Background Viral encephalitis is a devastating condition for which late treatment is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical audits indicate substantial room for improvement in detection and treatment. Ideally, improvement strategies should be tailored according to identified needs and barriers to change. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a personalized intervention to improve secondary care management of suspected encephalitis. Methods/Design The study is a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with assignment by graduate deanship. Participants from 24 hospitals nested within 12 postgraduate deanships in the United Kingdom (UK) were identified. We develop a multifaceted intervention package that includes core and flexible components with integrated behavior change techniques selected based on identified needs and barriers to change. The primary outcome will be a composite of the proportion of patients with suspected encephalitis who receive a timely and appropriate diagnostic lumbar puncture within 12 hours of hospital admission and treatment with acyclovir within 6 hours. We will collect outcome data pre-intervention and up to 12 months post-intervention from patient records. Statistical analysis at the cluster level will be blind to allocation. An economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention from the perspective of the health service.",0,0,
1793,The evolution of current medical and popular attitudes towards ultraviolet light exposure: part 3,"In the 1930s, attitudes toward ultraviolet (UV) light exposure began to change significantly within the medical profession. UV radiation has been promoted as healthy since the turn of the century, and particularly after the discovery of its role in vitamin D metabolism. Increasingly, however, attention would be focused on the risks of light exposure UV from sunlamps and sunbathing. During this time, the American Medical Association established guidelines for the approval of UV lamps and the appropriate therapeutic uses of phototherapy. The landmark experiments by Findlay and others, in which malignant skin tumors were induced in rodents after exposure to ultraviolet lamps or sunlight, would lead to widespread recognition of the carcinogenicity of ultraviolet radiation. The role of sunlight in the etiology of skin cancer was increasingly mentioned in popular magazine articles in the 1940s and 1950s. There was also a rapid growth in the sunscreen industry, although product efficacy remained unknown. very variable. In the 1950s, interest developed in the use of 8-methoxypsoralen (""the tanning pill"") and dihydroxyacetone (""suntan lotion in a bottle""). Despite the known risks of UV exposure and attempts by doctors and other health professionals to educate the public and modify behavior, tanning has remained stubbornly popular. Today, excessive exposure to ultraviolet light is recognized as the leading cause of approximately 1.3 million cases of skin cancer in the United States each year.",0,0,

1795,"The expert consensus guideline series. Optimization of the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: methods, comment and summary","OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important questions related to drug selection, dosage and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, adherence problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid in clinical decision making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders was conducted to address questions that have not been definitively answered in the research literature. METHOD: Based on a literature review, a written survey with 60 questions and 994 options was developed. Approximately half of the options were rated using a modified version of the 9-point RAND scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to write the answers (for example, average dose) or to check a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders, of whom 47 (94%) completed it. When analyzing responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a nonrandom distribution of scores using the chi-square ""goodness-of-fit"" test. We assigned a categorical rating (first line/preferred option, second line/alternative option, third line/generally inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guidance tables indicating preferred treatment strategies for key clinical situations were then developed. RESULTS: The expert panel reached a consensus on 88% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. Experts overwhelmingly approve of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychotic disorders. Risperidone was the first choice for first-episode and multiple-episode patients, while the other newer atypicals were classified as first-line or high as second-line, depending on the clinical situation. Clozapine and an atypical long-acting injectable (when available) were other high second-line options for patients with multiple episodes. The expert's dosing recommendations closely matched the drug labels, and his estimates of dose equivalence between antipsychotics followed a linear pattern. Experts considered 3 to 6 weeks an adequate antipsychotic trial, but would wait slightly longer (4 to 10 weeks) before making a major change in treatment regimen if there is a partial response. The experts recommended trying to improve response by increasing the dose of atypical and depot antipsychotics before switching to a different agent"";"" there was less agreement on increasing the dose of conventional antipsychotics before the switch, probably due to concerns about side effects at higher doses. If a decision is made to switch due to inadequate response, risperidone was the expert's first choice to switch, regardless of which drug was initially tried. Although there was some disparity in expert recommendations regarding how many agents to try before switching to clozapine, expert responses suggest that switching to clozapine should be clozapine was also the antipsychotic of choice for patients with suicidal behaviour. When changing oral antipsychotics, experts considered cross-titration to be the preferred strategy. When switching to an injectable antipsychotic, the experts stressed the importance of continuing the oral antipsychotic until therapeutic levels of the injectable agent are achieved. The experts considered psychosocial interventions as the first choice strategy for patients who were partially compliant, while pharmacological interventions were the first choice for patients with clear evidence of non-compliance. However, because it can be difficult to distinguish between partially compliant and noncompliant patients, the editors recommended combining psychosocial and pharmacological interventions to improve adherence whenever possible. When patients relapse due to adherence problems or if there is any question about adherence, experts recommend the use of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic and would select an injectable atypical when this option becomes available. Experts would also consider the use of an injectable atypical antipsychotic (when available) in many clinical situations that do not involve compliance issues. The experts highlighted the importance of monitoring health problems, especially obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, HIV risk behaviors, medical complications of substance abuse, heavy smoking and its effects, hypertension and amenorrhea , in patients receiving treatment with antipsychotics. Although many patients are prescribed adjuvant therapies, multiple antipsychotics, and combinations of different drug classes (eg, antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers or antidepressants) in an effort to improve response, experts gave little support to either of these strategies, with the exception of antidepressants for patients with dysphoria/depression, antidepressants or ECT for patients with suicidal behavior, and mood stabilizers for patients with aggression/violence. When asked about indicators of remission and recovery, experts considered acute improvement in psychotic symptoms to be the most important indicator of remission, while they considered more sustained improvement in multiple outcome domains (eg, functioning occupational/educational, peer relations, independent living) important in assessing recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions in the survey. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide guidance for addressing common clinical dilemmas that arise in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders. They can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients about the relative merits of a variety of interventions. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guideline can address the complexities involved in caring for each individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used when applying these recommendations.",0,0,
1796,The expert consensus guideline series. Behavioral Emergency Treatment 2005,"OBJECTIVES: Due to the inherent dangers and barriers to research in emergency settings, little data is available to guide clinicians on how best to manage behavioral emergencies. Key constructs, like agitation, are poorly defined. This lack of empirical data prompted us to conduct an expert opinion survey, the results of which were published in the 2001 Expert Consensus Guidelines on the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies. Several second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are now available. in new formulations to treat behavioral emergencies (eg, intramuscular [im]olanzapine and ziprasidone""; olanzapine and risperidone fast-dissolving tablets). Critical questions face the field. SGAs are significantly different from FGAs and from each other and have not been studied in unselected patients as FGAs have been Can SGAs be thought of as a class Do all antipsychotics have similar effects against agitation under different conditions and, if equally effective, what limits might their safety profiles?Should antipsychotics be used more specifically to treat psychotic conditions, while Benzodiazepines (BNZ) alone are used non-specifically? Few data are available on combinations of SGA and BNZ, and the findings on the traditional combination of haloperidol plus a BNZ may not be relevant to combinations with SGA. The culture is also evolving with more emphasis on patient involvement in treatment decisions. An international consensus has developed that calming rather than sedation is the appropriate endpoint of behavioral emergency interventions. We conducted a new expert opinion survey to update the recommendations from the previous survey. METHOD: A written survey of 61 questions (1020 options) was mailed to 50 experts in the field, 48 (96%) of whom completed it. The survey sought to define the level of agitation at which emergency interventions are appropriate, the scope of assessment based on urgency and the ability of patients to cooperate, guiding principles for selecting interventions, and appropriate physical and medication strategies in different levels of diagnostic confidence for a variety of tentative diagnoses and complicated conditions. A modified version of the RAND Corporation 9-point scale for rating appropriateness of medical decisions was used to rate most options. Consensus was defined as a non-random distribution of scores using the chi-square 'goodness of fit' test. We assigned a categorical ranking (first line/preferred, second line/alternative, third line/generally inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. The ratings were used to develop guidelines for preferred strategies in key clinical situations. This study received financial support from multiple sponsors, and the panel was blinded to sponsorship to reduce potential bias. Drug ratings were based on responses from only those respondents with direct experience with each drug. In reporting practice patterns, the panel was asked to respond based on actual data rather than estimates. RESULTS: The expert panel reached a consensus on 78% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. The responses suggest that clinicians can make tentative diagnoses with some confidence and that pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are differentially selected based on diagnosis and other salient demographic and medical characteristics. BNZs are recommended when no data is available, when there is no specific treatment (eg, personality disorder), or when they may have specific benefits (eg, intoxication). No SGA emerges as a nonspecific replacement for haloperidol""; instead, different SGAs are preferred in various circumstances based on current evidence. To the extent that haloperidol is recommended, it is almost always combined with a BNZ; haloperidol is only preferred alone in oral risperidone alone or in combination with a BNZ receives strong support in a variety of situations Oral olanzapine was rated very similarly to risperidone, with slightly higher ratings than risperidone in situations where studied (eg, schizophrenia, mania) and slightly lower ratings where not studied or safety may be a concern, there was less support for combining oral olanzapine with BNZ For oral treatment of schizophrenia-related agitation or mania, olanzapine alone, risperidone alone or in combination with a BNZ, and halo peridol plus a BNZ are first-line, with strong support also for combinations r divalproex with the antipsychotic for suspected mania. Oral ziprasidone and quetiapine generally received similar second-line ratings in most situations. If a parenteral agent is needed, im olanzapine alone received slightly more support than im ziprasidone alone; however, there was more support for im ziprasidone alone or in combination with a BNZ than for im olanzapine plus a BNZ, probably reflecting safety concerns. For example, for a provisional diagnosis of schizophrenia, the first-line parenteral options are im olanzapine or ziprasidone alone or im haloperidol or ziprasidone combined with a BNZ None of the newer parenteral formulations received as much support as the traditional agents (im BNZ, im haloperidol ) when no data is available or the diagnosis implies medical comorbidity or intoxication. When initial intervention with risperidone, ziprasidone, or haloperidol is unsuccessful, the panel recommended adding a BZD to the antipsychotic. However, when initial treatment with olanzapine or quetiapine is unsuccessful, increasing Perphenazine was consistently ranked as second line and droperidol and chlorpromazine as rec. He got third line ratings at all times. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines suggest that SGAs are now preferred for agitation in the setting of primary psychiatric illnesses, but that BNZs are preferred in other situations.",0,0,

The primary objective of this pilot study was to: 1) refine the GDM Management System (GooDMomS), a web-based behavioral pregnancy and postpartum intervention, and 2) assess the feasibility of the intervention. METHODS: In phase 1, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with women experiencing current or recent GDM mellitus to collect pilot data on the interface and content of the web-based intervention and to solicit women's recommendations for improvements to improve the GoodMomS intervention site. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and independently reviewed for major themes using Atlas.ti v7.0. In phase 2, a single-arm feasibility study was conducted and 23 participants were enrolled in the GoodMomS program. Participants received web lessons, self-monitoring of weight and glucose, automated feedback, and access to a message board for peer support. The primary outcome was viability, including recruitment, retention, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of women whose gestational weight gain (GWG) was within the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and who were able to return to their prepregnancy weight after delivery. RESULTS: Feedback from the semi-structured interviews focused on: 1) the usability of the self-monitoring diary and online tracking system, 2) access to a secure and reliable social network for peer support, and 3) the ability to antenatal physicians to access the online diary for clinical management. Overall, 21 (91%) completed the pregnancy phase. 15/21 (71%) of the participants were within the Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for GWG. Sixteen (70%) completed the postpartum phase. 7/16 (43%) and 9/16 (56%) of the participants returned to their pre-pregnancy weight at 6 and 30 weeks postpartum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the feasibility of the GoodDMomS program. The results may have implications for web technology in perinatal care and inform the current care paradigm for women with GDM. The findings support further research with recruitment of a larger sample of participants and comparison of results with intervention and standard care.

1800,The impact of a body weight and physical activity (BeWEL) intervention initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening program: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a diet and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) on weight change in people with a body mass index >25 weight (kg)/height (m)(2) at increased risk of colorectal cancer and other obesity-related comorbidities. DESIGN Multicentre, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Four health boards of the Scottish National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone a colonoscopy after a positive fecal occult blood test, as part of the national bowel screening program, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomized to intervention and 166 to control. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or a 12-month intervention group (three face-to-face visits with a lifestyle counselor plus monthly 15-minute phone calls). A goal of 7% body weight loss was set, and participants received a personalized energy prescription (2,508 kJ (600 kcal) below what is needed to maintain weight) and body weight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self-reported confidence, ambivalence, and weight-related personal values. Behavioral strategies included goal setting, identification of implementation intentions, self-monitoring of body weight, and counselor feedback on reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and variables of glucose metabolism, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77 ) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Between-group differences were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. CONCLUSIONS Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening program, which offers considerable potential for disease risk reduction in older adults.

1801,The impact of a nurse-led care program on physical and psychosocial events and parameters in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial in primary care in Russia,"BACKGROUND: Disease management programs (DMPs) improve the quality of care for patients with heart failure (HF). However, only a limited number of trials have studied the efficacy of such programs for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of a nurse-led, structured patient education program and plan of care in general practice on outcome parameters and events in patients with PFEFI. METHODS: Single-blind randomized clinical trial with a six-month intervention and an additional 12-month follow-up. In the control group, patients (n = 41) were managed according to Russian national guidelines. Patients in the intervention group (n = 44) received education on individual lifestyle changes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor modifications, home physical training, and weekly nursing consultations in addition to usual care . RESULTS: Six months after inclusion, patients in the intervention group had significant improvements in body mass index, waist circumference, six-minute walk test distance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein , left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, quality of life, and level. of anxiety After 18 months, there were 11 deaths (25%) or hospitalizations in the intervention group and 12 (29%) in the control group (P = 0.134). Cardiovascular mortality and readmission rate were not significantly reduced after six months of follow-up: hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.17-1.28""; P = 0.197). at 18 months, it was 0.85 (0.42-1.73;"" p = 0.658). CONCLUSION: This primary care-based PMD for HFpEF patients improved patients' emotional status and quality of life, positively influenced body weight, functional capacity, and lipid profile, and attenuated cardiac remodeling.",0,0,
1802,The impact of cost screens on the primary care physician's ordering of laboratory tests.,"BACKGROUND Physicians are under increased pressure to help control rising health care costs, yet they lack information about the cost implications of patient care decisions. OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of real-time display of laboratory costs on primary care physician ordering of common laboratory tests in the outpatient setting. DESIGN Interrupted time series analysis with a parallel control group. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and fifteen primary care physicians (153 intervention and 62 control) who used a common electronic health record between April 2010 and November 2011. The setting was an alliance of five multispecialty group practices in Massachusetts. INTERVENTION The average Medicare reimbursement rate for 27 laboratory tests was displayed in an electronic health record at the time of order, including 21 lower cost tests (<$40.00) and six higher cost tests (>$40.00). ). MAIN MEASURES We compared the change in the slope of the monthly rate of laboratory orders between intervention and control physicians for 12 months before the intervention and 6 months after the intervention. We surveyed all intervention and control physicians at 6 months post-intervention to assess cost attitudes and cost visualizations. KEY FINDINGS Across 27 laboratory tests, intervention clinicians demonstrated a significant decrease in request rates compared to control clinicians for five (19%) tests. This included a significant relative decrease in order rates for four of 21 (19%) lower-cost lab tests and one of six (17%) higher-cost lab tests. The majority (81%) of physicians reported that the intervention improved their knowledge of the relative costs of laboratory tests. CONCLUSIONS Real-time display of cost information in an electronic health record can lead to a modest reduction in laboratory test ordering and is welcome. Our study demonstrates that electronic health records can serve as a tool to promote cost transparency and reduce the use of laboratory tests.",1,1,
1803,The impact of disseminating evidence-based guidelines for the assessment and treatment of major depression in a managed behavioral health care organization,"This study assesses whether a managed behavioral health care organization can influence adherence to practice guidelines for the treatment of major depression in a randomized guideline dissemination trial. The guidelines were distributed to mental health clinicians (N = 443) under one of three conditions: (1) a general mailing of the guidelines to clinicians, (2) a mailing in which the guidelines were addressed to a patient starting treating with the doctor, and (3) not sending guidelines. The results showed no effect of guideline dissemination as measured by patient and physician self-report and through episode characteristics derived from claims data, despite sentinel effects. The results also showed high rates of adherence to physician-reported guidelines that were not detected in the claims data, indicating significant undertreatment of depression. The results suggest that mental health systems should seek other outreach strategies to improve compliance with standards of care and raise the performance of independent physicians.",0,0,

Unlike textbooks and reviews that seek to improve medical knowledge, guidelines seek to influence medical behavior. Scientific models of clinical decision making, such as theory of action and empirical data on the effects of guidelines, suggest that guidelines will not always achieve their goals, but may even lead to a deterioration in the quality of care medical. Therefore, there is a need for controlled clinical trials to investigate whether clinicians exposed to the guidelines achieve better patient outcomes than clinicians unaware of the guidelines. Guidelines should only be considered evidence-based if their positive effects have been empirically demonstrated.",0,0,

1806,The impact of medication adherence on lung health outcomes in cystic fibrosis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As new medicines continue to appear on the market to improve the health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), it is increasingly important to address patient adherence. Currently, adherence to pulmonary medications is about 50% for people with CF. There has been recent research showing that poor adherence is linked to poorer health outcomes. This review summarizes recent research on the impact of adherence on lung health and highlights future areas of research and clinical practice to address this growing need. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research has indicated that nonadherence is associated with increased hospitalizations and pulmonary exacerbations, lower baseline lung function, and longer length of stay. However, most research has been conducted using pharmacy refill records as an objective measure of adherence. Electronic medication monitoring provides more detailed information about usage patterns, which can directly inform clinical care. Furthermore, there have been few published clinical trials evaluating behavioral interventions to promote adherence. ABSTRACT: Given recent research linking adherence to lung health outcomes, there is a growing need to measure and assess adherence in clinical care. As new CF drugs are approved, methods for monitoring adherence also need to be developed and approved. Clinicians should continue to assess barriers to adherence so that interventions can be individually tailored to the needs of the patient.",0,0,

Effective approaches are required to support self-management. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to establish whether telemetric-supported monitoring of glycemic control and blood pressure results in reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c"";"" the primary outcome of a measure of long-term glycemic control) and the secondary outcomes of blood pressure. and weight among people with poorly controlled diabetes compared with a control group receiving usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: Design: multicenter, randomized controlled trial with integrated qualitative study. Setting: Primary care in the Lothian, Kent, Glasgow and Borders regions of the UK. Participants: people with type 2 diabetes and confirmed HbA1c >7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Intervention/comparison: Randomisation to intervention or control groups will be performed by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. Participants in the intervention group will be shown how to use blood glucose and blood pressure monitors and scales that use Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit readings via modem to a remote server. These participants will be asked to provide at least two weekly morning and evening blood glucose measurements and weekly weight and blood pressure measurements. Practice nurses will review measurements at least weekly and communicate with patients to adjust therapy according to guidelines and reinforce lifestyle advice. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. All participants will receive an individual education session. Follow-up: Measurements will be made at practices 9 months after randomization by research nurses blinded to allocation. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c and the secondary outcome measure is daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and cost per quality-adjusted life year. Analysis: Intention-to-treat analyzes will be performed. The sample size of 320 participants allows for 20% dropout and has 80% power at 5% significance to detect a 0.5% (6 mmol/mol) absolute drop in HbA1c in the intervention. The qualitative study will explore the experiences of patients and professionals using the intervention. TEST REGISTRATION: Test registration number ISRCTN71674628.",0,0,

1809,The importance of doctor-patient communication in the care of somatizing patients,"The term ""somatization"" refers to the manifestation of multiple somatic complaints not explained by organic changes. According to the literature, 15-25 percent of all medical visits are related to somatization. Because medical training does not place sufficient emphasis on evaluating the possible psychological antecedents of certain somatic symptoms, clinicians may feel powerless and make unwarranted diagnostic and therapeutic efforts. Patients may also feel helpless and frustrated, their anxiety and the intensity of their complaints may increase. Since stress is an important factor in the somatization process, reducing stress and improving coping are key elements of treatment guidelines for chronic diseases. Evidence-based interventions range from brief counseling and medication to cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy. Reattribution, a brief (10-30 minute) structured intervention that can be implemented in primary or secondary care, can in certain cases result in a significant decrease in somatic symptoms and anxiety.",0,0,
1810,The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Care Improvement Study: CAROL Improves Processes of Care and Quality of Life for COPD Patients in Primary Care: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: The Swiss Ministry of Health launched a national quality program 'QualiCCare' in 2011 to improve medical care for COPD patients. The aim of this study is to determine if participation in the COPD quality initiative ('QualiCCare') improves adherence to processes and shows the impact on the care of patients with COPD and on the impact of COPD on the a person's life. METHODS: CAROL is a cluster randomized controlled trial with randomization at the general practitioner (GP) level. Thirty GPs will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group of equal size. Each GP will address consecutively and regardless of the reason for the current consultation, patients aged 45 years or older, with a smoking history of >/= ten pack-years (PY). Patients with confirmed COPD (by spirometric evaluation) will be included in the study. GPs in the intervention group will receive 'QualiCCare' education, which addresses knowledge, decision-making and behavioral aspects, as well as the provision of care according to COPD quality indicators and key elements based on the evidence. In the control group, no educational intervention will be applied and COPD patients will be treated as usual. The study period is one year. The primary outcome measure is an aggregate score of relevant clinical processes that define elements in the care of patients with COPD: smoking cessation counseling, influenza vaccination, motivation for physical activity, appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient education, and collaborative care. . Given a power of 90% and an alpha level of significance of 5%, 15 GPs recruiting eight patients each in both arms of the study will be required. With an assumed dropout rate of 20%, it will be necessary to include 288 patients. DISCUSSION: It is important to develop and implement interventions that add value to COPD care considering quality and efficiency. Care pathways that modify clinicians' knowledge and behavior have the potential to improve care by transferring knowledge to clinical practice.

1811,The influence of a physician-patient intervention program on dietary intake,"BACKGROUND: Efficient dietary interventions are needed for patients with hypertension in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To assess the separate and combined influence of a medical intervention (MD-I) and a patient intervention (PT-I) on the dietary intake of patients with hypertension. DESIGN: A nested 2x2 design randomized controlled trial conducted over 18 months. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 physicians and 574 outpatients with hypertension. INTERVENTION: MD-I included training modules addressing the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of high blood pressure management and lifestyle modification guidelines. PT-I included lifestyle counseling to adopt the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, reduce sodium intake, control weight, increase exercise, and moderate alcohol intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intakes were measured using the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire. Concordance with the DASH dietary pattern was estimated using a DASH score. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The main effects of MD-I and PT-I, and their interaction, were evaluated by analysis of covariance. RESULTS: After 6 months of intervention, MD-I participants significantly increased intake of potassium, fruit, juice, and carbohydrates; decreased fat intake; and improved overall diet quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index. The PT-I intervention resulted in an increase in intake of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, dairy products, and the Healthy Eating Index score, and a decrease in intake of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sweets and fats/oils/sweets. Furthermore, PT-I improved the overall DASH concordance score. Change in DASH score was significantly associated with changes in blood pressure and weight at 6 months. At 18 months, most changes reverted to baseline levels, including DASH score. CONCLUSIONS: Both MD-I and PT-I improved eating patterns at 6 months with some sustained effects at 18 months. Although all observed dietary changes were consistent with the DASH nutrient targets or food group guidelines, only the PT-I intervention was effective in improving the overall DASH concordance score. This finding affirms the role of medical nutrition therapy in long-term intensive interventions for hypertension risk reduction and weight control and underscores the need to develop maintenance strategies. Additionally, this study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between physicians, registered dietitians and other dietary professionals, and lay health advisors as they help patients make healthy behavior changes.",0,0,
1812,The influence of patient characteristics on the adequacy of surgical treatment for patients with breast cancer. Women's Oncology Project,"BACKGROUND: Within the framework of a multi-year educational intervention sponsored by the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities, patterns of care provided to patients with breast cancer in Italian general hospitals were monitored to identify areas of practice whose quality needed improvement. DESIGN: Information on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in 63 general hospitals in eight Italian regions performed on 1724 consecutive patients with breast cancer was collected retrospectively from medical records. The quality of care was assessed using a diagnostic and therapeutic score based on the observed degree of compliance with previously established courses of action. RESULTS: The mean value of the global diagnosis and staging score was 60%. About a third of surgeries (38%) were inappropriate: a quarter (24%) of patients with stage I-II disease underwent unnecessary radical surgery (ie, Halsted mastectomy) and limited surgery in patients with small tumors (ie, < or = 2 cm) was underutilized. Chronological age influenced physician behavior: older patients were more likely to have less intensive diagnostic workup and less appropriate surgical treatment (with more frequent performance of an unnecessary radical operation and less frequent use of surgical intervention). limited), regardless of their general condition. Health condition. The presence of one or more coexisting diseases was associated with a lack of axillary cleaning and less use of conservative surgery, regardless of age. CONCLUSION: In agreement with others, this study confirms the existence of a clinically important effect of patient age on diagnostic and therapeutic behavior and the use of unnecessarily radical surgical procedures. The document analyzes the implications of these findings for the next stage of the educational project, in which practical guidelines will be developed and implemented to improve the quality of care for breast cancer patients.",0,0,
1813,"The intellectual structure and substance of the field of knowledge utilization: a longitudinal analysis of cocitation of authors, 1945 to 2004","Background It has been argued that science and society are in the midst of a far-reaching renegotiation of the social contract between science and society, with society becoming a much more active partner in knowledge creation. On the one hand, new forms of knowledge production are emerging and, on the other, both science and society are experiencing a rapid acceleration of new forms of knowledge utilization. At the same time, since World War II, the science behind the field of knowledge utilization has grown exponentially. There are few in-depth reviews of this field, and no comprehensive analysis has used bibliometric methods. Methods Using bibliometric analysis, specifically first author co-citation analysis, our group performed a domain analysis of the field of knowledge utilization, tracing its historical development between 1945 and 2004. Our purposes were to map the historical development of knowledge utilization as a field, and identify the changing intellectual structure of its scientific domains. We analyzed more than 5,000 articles using citation data extracted from Web of Science?. Search terms were combinations of knowledge, research, evidence, guidelines, ideas, science, innovation, technology, information theory and use, utilization, and acceptance. Results We provide an overview of the intellectual structure and how it changed over six decades. The field did not become large enough to be represented by a co-citation map until the mid-1960s. Our findings demonstrate vigorous growth from the mid-1960s to 2004, as well as the emergence of specialized domains reflecting different groups of intellectual activity and thought. Until the mid-1980s, the main domains focused on the diffusion of innovation, technology transfer and knowledge utilization. Starting slowly in the mid-1980s and then growing rapidly, a fourth scientific domain emerged, evidence-based medicine. The field is dominated in every decade by one individual, Everett Rogers, and by one paradigm, the diffusion of innovation. Conclusion We conclude that the received view that the social science disciplines are in a state where no accepted set of principles or theories guide research (ie, they are pre-paradigmatic) could not be supported for this field. Second, we document the emergence of a new domain within the field of knowledge utilization, evidence-based medicine. Third, we conclude that Everett Rogers was the dominant figure in the field and, until the rise of evidence-based medicine, his portrayal of the mainstream model was the dominant paradigm in the field.",0,0,
1814,"The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcomes Study (IBSOS): rationale and design of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 12-month follow-up of self-administered versus physician-administered CBT for moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome","Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, often disabling gastrointestinal disorder, the full range of symptoms of which do not have satisfactory medical or dietary treatment. One of the few empirically validated treatments includes a specific psychological therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy which, if available, is typically delivered over several months by trained professionals in tertiary care settings. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient versions of CBT that require minimal professional assistance but maintain the efficacy profile of clinical CBT.

1815,The Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study 2 (IDES-2): a long-term behavioral intervention for the adoption and maintenance of a physically active lifestyle,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA)/exercise has become an integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current guidelines are difficult to implement in this population due to a number of barriers, most notably the lack of acceptable, feasible, and validated behavioral intervention strategies. The present manuscript reports the rationale, study design and methods, and design considerations of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)-2, a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a behavior change strategy to increase total daily physical activity and reduce sedentary time (SED-time) in patients with DM2. METHODS/DESIGN: Starting January 7, 2014, IDES_2 began enrolling 300 patients with known T2DM of at least 1 year's duration in three tertiary referral outpatient diabetes clinics in Rome. Additional requirements are age 40 to 80 years, body mass index 27 to 40 kg/m2, sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity for at least 6 months, ability to walk 1.6 km unassisted, and eligibility after a cardiovascular evaluation. Patients are randomized by center and within each center, by age and type of diabetes treatment to the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group (INT) (n = 150) receive theoretical and practical exercise counseling consisting of aggregate behavior change techniques (one individual theoretical counseling session plus eight individual theoretical and practical exercise counseling sessions two times a week) once a year for 3 years. Patients in the control group (CON) (n = 150), receive standard care, including general practitioner recommendations for daily physical activity. The primary outcomes are total daily BP and SED time, objectively measured using an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disorders, well-being/depression, and health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: The behavioral intervention strategy tested in the IDES_2 is based on strong theoretical foundations and uses various behavior change techniques, two factors that have been found to improve the effectiveness of behavioral intervention. In addition, physicians and exercise specialists have been specifically trained to advise/prescribe and supervise PA/exercise, respectively, in subjects suffering from metabolic disorders. Finally, the large sample size, the long duration of the study and the objective measurement of PA allow statistically significant and scientifically sound conclusions to be drawn about the viability and efficacy of this intervention in patients with DM2.

A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, 30% of subfertile women are overweight or obese, and there is currently no agreement on fertility care for them. Data from observational and small intervention studies suggest that weight reduction will increase the chance of conception, decrease pregnancy complications, and improve perinatal outcome, but this has not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials. This study will assess the cost and effects of a six-month structured lifestyle program aiming at weight reduction followed by conventional fertility care (intervention group) compared to conventional fertility care alone (intervention group). control) in overweight and obese subfertile women. We hypothesize that the intervention will decrease the need for fertility treatment, reduce overweight-related pregnancy complications, and improve perinatal outcome. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter randomized controlled trial in subfertile women (age 18-39 years) with a body mass index between 29 and 40 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria are azoospermia, use of donor sperm, severe endometriosis, premature ovarian failure, pre-existing endocrinopathies or hypertensive disorders. achieved through a combination of diet, increased physical activity, and behavior modification. At six months, in case conception has not been achieved, these patients will start fertility treatment according to the Dutch fertility guidelines. In the control group, treatment will be started according to the Dutch fertility guidelines, regardless of the patient's weight. OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure is a single healthy fetus delivered after at least 37 weeks' gestation following vaginal delivery. Secondary outcome parameters, including pregnancy outcome and complications, percentage of women needing fertility treatment, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, body weight, quality of life, and costs. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle and a cost-benefit analysis will be performed to compare costs and health effects in the intervention and control group.

The questionnaires will help define the diagnosis and the degree of nicotine dependence, as well as the fingerprint of the patient's smoking history. The ICD-10 code and the Fagerstrom nicotine dependence test are used. There is no indicated therapy without the optimal motivation of the patient. Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model is widely accepted to separate the stage of motivation into precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, and action. Many other factors, such as previous experiences, catastrophic scenarios, self-efficacy, and therapeutic modality selection, are important to obtain the best result. 90% of a gatekeeper's job is minimal intervention. This means individually tailored arguments to change the patient's motivation to quit. The concept is defined in the rules of the five Rs with relevance, risks, rewards, obstacles and repetition. Following these criteria, the gatekeeper achieves a positive change in their motivation of up to 60% with a single minimal intervention. Smoking cessation guidelines around the world are very similar, showing an A-level rating for a synergy of behavioral therapy and nicotine replacement medication, bupropion, or varenicline. The selection of any other regimen is less efficient or anecdotal and leads to a greater loss of life expectancy for the smoker. The gatekeeper has the infrastructure, knowledge, and trust of his patient to act as a steward of the disease.

The trial aimed to test whether this multimodal intervention improved adherence to recommended targets for a range of surrogate indicators relevant to blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium phosphate abnormalities. The trial also tested whether the same intervention slowed CKD progression and prevented CV complications in CKD patients. METHOD: Twenty-two renal clinics were randomized into 2 arms: an intervention arm applying a multi-method quality improvement intervention and a control arm providing standard care. Surrogate indicators were measured to assess blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium-phosphate abnormalities. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the vast majority of patients enrolled in this study (95%) were being treated with antihypertensive medications, baseline BP goals (specific for proteinuria level and diabetes) were met only in the 45% of non-proteinuric patients and in only 14% and 18% of proteinuric and diabetic patients, respectively. The use of diuretics in hypertensive patients was less than necessary, and about 80% of the patients presented a salt excretion >100 mmol/24 hours. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were off target in more than 40% of patients, but only about 60% of these were taking statins. The vast majority of CKD patients were obese or overweight. The proportion of smokers was relatively small (13%) and 37% of patients had quit smoking, indicating that patients are aware of the health risks of smoking.

1824,The medical office of the 21st century (MOXXI): effectiveness of computerized support for decision-making in reducing inappropriate prescription in primary care.,"Background: Drug-related adverse events are common in the elderly, and inappropriate prescribing is a preventable risk factor. Our goal was to determine whether inappropriate prescribing could be reduced when primary care physicians had computerized access to information on all prescriptions dispensed and automatic alerts of potential prescribing problems. Methods: We randomly assigned 107 primary care physicians with at least 100 patients aged 66 years or older (total 12,560) to a group that received computerized decision support (CDS) or a control group. CDS group physicians had access to information on current and past prescriptions through a dedicated computer link to the provincial senior drug insurance program. When the CDS software identified any of the 159 clinically relevant prescription problems, the physician received an alert that identified the nature of the problem, the possible consequences, and the alternative therapy. The rate of initiation and discontinuation of potentially inappropriate prescriptions was evaluated over a 13-month period. Results: In the 2 months prior to the study, 31.8% of patients in the CDS group and 33.3% of those in the control group had at least 1 potentially inappropriate prescription. During the study, the number of potentially inappropriate new prescriptions per 1,000 visits was significantly lower (18%) in the CDS group than in the control group (relative rate [RR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.98), but differences between groups in the rate of discontinuation of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were significant only for therapeutic duplication by the study doctor and another doctor (RR 1.66, 95% CI : 0.99 to 2.79) and drug interactions caused by prescriptions written by the doctor. study physician (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.98-4.70). Interpretation: Computerized access to comprehensive medication profiles and alerts on potential prescribing problems reduces the initiation rate of potentially inappropriate prescriptions, but has a more selective effect on discontinuation of such prescriptions.",0,1,
1825,The moderating effect of adherence-promoting interventions with clients on evidence-based practices for children and adolescents with mental health problems.,"Poor adherence of children and adolescents to evidence-based psychosocial interventions remains a critical impediment to treatment efficacy. To maintain client adherence, researchers and clinicians have employed a number of adherence promotion strategies, from phone calls and letters to provide transportation and childcare costs to motivation-enhancing therapies. However, the influence of adherence promoters on intervention outcomes was not reported. This study examined the moderating effect of adherence promotion strategies in a survey and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of cognitive behavioral treatments, interpersonal therapy, and psychoeducation for children and adolescents with mental health problems (k = 33). The results indicated the type and intensity of effect sizes of the moderated study of adherence promoters according to client characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis). Preliminary findings suggest that men had higher effect sizes when more intensive adherence promotion efforts were employed. Adherence promotion efforts were associated with lower effect sizes for youth who were diagnosed with externalizing disorders. The results of this study suggest directions for future research to clarify clinical guidelines for maximizing retention in evidence-based psychotherapy.",0,0,
1826,The myADHDportal.com Improvement Program: An Innovative Quality Improvement Intervention to Improve the Quality of ADHD Care Among Community Pediatricians,"Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has developed and disseminated clear evidence-based guidelines for ADHD care, community pediatricians often have difficulty implementing these guidelines. New strategies are needed to improve the quality of care that children with ADHD receive and to improve pediatricians' use of the AAP consensus guidelines. An evidence-based quality improvement intervention has been developed that effectively improves the quality of ADHD care provided by community pediatricians. To facilitate widespread dissemination of this intervention model, the entire intervention has been modified for online delivery. The intervention is called the myADHDportal.com Improvement Program. The full functionality of this online intervention is described, including the collection of online ADHD rating scales from parents and teachers and online communication between parents, teachers, and clinicians. In addition, the web portal integrates several innovative quality improvement features, including an online wizard to map the flow of ADHD patients, an online report card to monitor quality of care, and an online wizard to guide practices through the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle process. The combination of clinical utility and quality improvement tools facilitates the delivery of quality ADHD care and reduces many of the barriers to implementing AAP-recommended practice behaviors. The initial results with this intervention model are reviewed and the dissemination objectives are described.",0,0,

This review examines the components of an organized compliance management program that has been successful in uncontrolled trials in promoting compliance and reducing morbidity and cost. DATA SOURCES: A literature review was conducted in the following areas of asthma management: guidelines, cost, morbidity, compliance, monitoring, and communication skills. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that examined the outcomes of psychoeducational, behavioral, monitoring, and communication interventions. RESULTS: Studies using individual interventions by themselves were moderately effective in promoting adherence. Two uncontrolled studies of children with severe asthma, treated in inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation settings, used 4 intervention strategies to achieve a marked reduction in morbidity and cost. These strategies included: (1) objective adherence monitoring; (2) identification of the cause(s) of noncompliance; (3) delivery of ""cause-specific"" strategies; and (4) use of motivational interviewing communication skills to improve strategy delivery. CONCLUSION: Nonadherence remains a significant problem. Clinicians need an organized approach proven to improve adherence and reduce morbidity and cost Evaluation of effective methods in a controlled manner is warranted to increase the evidence of adherence management for future asthma guidelines.",0,0,

George Beam argues that all survey research instruments, all question types, including surveys, face-to-face interviews, and focus groups, produce unreliable and potentially inaccurate results. Because those who rely on survey research only see the answers to the questions, it is impossible for them, or anyone else, to evaluate the results. They cannot know if the answers correspond to the real behaviors of the respondents (objective phenomena) or to their true beliefs and opinions (subjective phenomena). Reliable information can only be acquired through observation, experimentation, multiple data sources, formal model building and testing, document analysis, and comparison. In fifteen chapters divided into six parts: The Pervasiveness of Survey Research, The Problem, Questioning Instruments, Question Environments, Askers, and Appropriate Research Designs and Methods, The Survey Research Problem demonstrates how the instruments of questioning, the environments in which the questions and answers take place. and the survey researchers themselves distort the results and thus make the answers unreliable. The last two chapters and appendices examine observation, other data collection methods, and research designs that can produce accurate or correct information, and show how reliance on survey research can and should be overcome.

1838,The QICKD study protocol: a cluster randomized trial to compare quality improvement interventions to reduce systolic BP in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a relatively new but common long-term condition, affecting 5-10% of the population. Effective management of CKD, with an emphasis on tight blood pressure (BP) control, reduces cardiovascular risk and delays CKD progression. There is currently an unprecedented increase in referrals to specialist renal services, often located in tertiary centres, inconvenience for patients and a waste of resources. National and international CKD guidelines include quality objectives for primary care. However, there have been no rigorous evaluations of strategies to implement these guidelines. This study aims to test whether quality improvement interventions improve primary care management of elevated blood pressure in CKD, reduce cardiovascular risk, and slow the progression of kidney disease Design Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (CRT) Methods This three-arm CRT compares two well-established quality improvement interventions with usual practice. The two interventions comprise: provision of clinical practice guidelines with indications and audit-based education. The study population will be all people with CKD from general practices in eight locations in England. Randomization will be carried out at the level of general practices. The intended sample (three arms of 25 practices) powers the study to detect a difference of 3 mmHg in systolic BP between the different quality improvement interventions. An additional ten practices per arm will receive a questionnaire to measure any change in confidence in managing CKD. Follow-up will take place for two years. Results will be measured using routinely collected anonymous data extracted from the practice's computer systems. The primary outcome measure will be reduction in systolic BP in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension at two years. Secondary outcomes will include biomedical outcomes and quality markers, including physician confidence in CKD management. A small group of practices (n = 4) will participate in an in-depth evaluation of the process. We will use time series data to examine the natural history of CKD in the community. Finally, we will carry out an economic evaluation based on a comparison of the profitability of each intervention.",0,0,
1839,The quality of diabetes care for Gullah families in South Carolina,"Empirical evidence from the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) suggests that maintaining normal glycemic control can prevent both microvascular and macrovascular disease in people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (DCCT, 1993). Adults with T2DM are also more likely to have hypertension (73% [HTN]), and patients with both are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop diabetic complications compared to the general population (CDC, 2005). The purpose of this descriptive study was to 1) describe the quality of diabetes care received by Gullah families who participated in the ""Project Sugar"" research study;"" and 2) comparing Gullah's quality of care to the national sample on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Diabetes Report Card using the two indicators of blood pressure and HbA1c. This was a secondary analysis of a main study comparing selected data from the CDC Diabetes Report Card, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) . Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained from 1,057 research participants (N = 1,057). Overall, compared to the national sample in the CDC Report Card, HbA1c greater than 9.5% mg/dL was higher among the Gullah (30.2% vs. 18%), and blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg was lower (29% vs 34%) among the participants. Nearly half of the Gullahs (45.9%) reported neurovascular complications, including foot pain, claudication, and kidney complications from kidney infection and dialysis (7.3%). Gullah study participants are at risk for diabetes-related complications. The results suggest a quality gap in diabetes care and also suggest health disparities in outcome measures. Optimal care that is consistent with clinical guidelines could have a significant impact in reducing complications and health disparities.",0,0,
1840,The rational patient and beyond: implications for treatment adherence in people with psychiatric disabilities.,"Objective: Many people with psychiatric disabilities do not benefit from evidence-based practices because they often do not seek or fully adhere to them. One way psychologists have made sense of this health and rehabilitation decision process and subsequent behaviors (of which adherence might be seen as one) is by proposing a ""rational patient""; that is, that decisions are deliberately made by weighing the perceived costs and benefits of intervention options. Research in social psychology, however, suggests limitations to a rational patient theory that impact health decision-making models. Design: The research literature was reviewed for studies of rational patient models and alternative theories with empirical support. It focused especially on models specifically related to decisions about rehabilitation strategies for psychiatric disability. Results: Notions of the rational patient evolved from various psychological models, including the health belief model, the motivation theory of protection and planned behavior theory. A variety of practical strategies evolved to promote rational decision making. However, research also suggests limiting ions to rational health deliberations. (1) Rather than being carefully and consciously considered, many health decisions are implicit and may occur outside of awareness. (2) Decisions are not always planned; often it is the immediate demands of a context rather than a prior balance of costs and benefits that have the greatest effect. (3) Cold cognitions often do not dictate the process; Emotional factors play an important role in health decisions. Each of these limitations suggests additional practice strategies that facilitate a person's health decisions. Conclusion: the old rational decision-making models must be supplanted by multi-process models that explain supradeliberative factors in decisions and health behaviors (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,

The study was carried out in a primary care center in northern Jordan. METHODS: One hundred fifty-two patients with dyslipidemia were randomized into intervention and control groups and followed up for a period of 6 months. Patients in the intervention group received intensive follow-up by a clinical pharmacist who worked closely with physicians to monitor lipid profiles in accordance with the third edition of the National Education Program Adult Treatment Panel recommendations. On Cholesterol, patients in the control group received standard medical care.

BACKGROUND: Nurses/social workers have extensive contact with clients with intellectual disabilities. Despite this key position, the contribution of nurses/social workers to the diagnosis of mental health problems and challenging behaviors is quite limited. The authors developed the multidimensional 'Diagnostic Guide for Anxiety and Challenging Behaviours'. In this article, the implementation of this guideline on the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers is evaluated, as well as the role of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process. DESIGN: This study employed a comparative multiple-case study design. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative research methods.

Results of the approach with respect to child health and development, reduction of hospital costs, and family adjustment are reported. The approach is guided by a neurodevelopmental framework for understanding preterm infants and relies on the abilities of professionals to collaborate with each other and with families in support of infants' developmental, emotional, and medical well-being. The primary vehicle for clinical implementation is detailed behavioral observation with subsequent recommendations for individualized care based on the infant's current functioning and apparent developmental goals.

Despite the significant number of preschool children who may be diagnosed with ADHD, there are limited controlled data available on pharmacological interventions that are increasingly being used in this population. A 1990 review showed that 34% of pediatricians and 15% of family physicians had prescribed psychostimulant medications for preschool children with ADHD, and pharmacoepidemiological studies indicate increasing use of stimulants in preschool children during childhood. 1990s. Unfortunately, only six controlled trials, with a total enrollment of less than 200 children, have been conducted using these drugs in preschool children. While these small studies provide some evidence of benefit from the use of methylphenidate in preschool children with ADHD, more data is critically needed. Practice parameters developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide some guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of young children with ADHD, but are based primarily on research in elementary school-aged children. The ongoing PATS (Preschool ADHD Treatment Study), funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, will provide important clinical guidance for diagnostic considerations and intervention strategies for children with ADHD ages 3 to 5 years.

1850,The role of surveillance in the management of small renal masses,"Incidentally detected small renal masses (SRM) have increased significantly in recent years due to the widespread use of enhanced cross-sectional imaging. A significant number of incident SRMs are diagnosed in elderly patients who are more likely to undergo imaging for other medical problems. Historically, the natural history of SRMs has been poorly understood because most masses are surgically removed soon after diagnosis. Several SRM surveillance reports have been published in recent years. When followed conservatively with serial imaging, SRMs have variable growth rates averaging 0.28 cm/year, according to a recent meta-analysis. Larger series with longer follow-up are needed, but a significant number of small tumors appear to be indolent with a slow growth rate and a limited tendency to progress. The standard treatment to improve SRMs is surgery. Up to a third of tumors <4 cm surgically removed are histologically benign. The results of current surgical treatment of histologically confirmed renal cell carcinomas <4 cm are excellent, but this has not led to a decrease in mortality. Based on these considerations and the data available on the natural history of SRM, it seems reasonable to consider that we may be overtreating these lesions. This is especially true for elderly or unfit patients who have a reduced life expectancy. In these selected patients and in those who refuse active treatment, it seems reasonable to propose an initial period of active surveillance for incidental MRE, with late intervention for those tumors that are going to grow rapidly during follow-up. Percutaneous needle biopsies of renal tumors can be performed safely with the use of modern techniques and have the potential to characterize SRM in histological diagnosis, allowing a better selection of the conservative or active treatment that best suits each individual. individual patient.",0,0,

Theories from a wide range of disciplines are potentially relevant to PSP research. The theory can be used in research to explain clinical and organizational behavior, to guide the development and selection of PSPs, and to evaluate their implementation and mechanisms of action.

Coronary heart disease is a common cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in Ireland. Secondary prevention has been advocated as a key strategy to reduce CHD mortality levels and general practice has been highlighted as an ideal setting for secondary prevention initiatives. Current indications suggest that there is considerable room for improvement in the provision of secondary prevention for patients with established heart disease on the island of Ireland. The review literature recommends structured programs with ongoing support and follow-up of patients; the provision of training, tailored to the needs of the practice of access to evidence of the effectiveness of secondary prevention; structured recovery programs that also take into account the needs of the individual practice; and patient-centered consultations accompanied by attention to disease management guidelines. METHODS: SPHERE is a cluster randomized controlled trial, with practice-level randomization to intervention and control groups, recruiting 960 patients from 48 practices in three study centers (Belfast, Dublin, and Galway). The primary outcomes are blood pressure, total cholesterol, physical and mental health status (SF-12), and hospital readmissions. The intervention is carried out for two years and data is collected at baseline, one year and two years of follow-up. The data is obtained from medical records, consultations with doctors and postal questionnaires from patients. The SPHERE intervention involves the implementation of a structured and systematic program of care for patients with CHD attending general practice. It is a multifaceted intervention that has been developed to respond to barriers and solutions to optimal secondary prevention identified in preliminary qualitative research with clinicians and patients. General practitioners and practice nurses attend training sessions to facilitate behavior change and medication prescription guidelines for secondary prevention of CHD. Patients are invited to attend regular quarterly consultations for two years, during which goals and targets for secondary prevention are established and reviewed. The analysis will be reinforced by economic, regulatory and qualitative components.",0,0,
1854,The standard of care: a case report and ethical analysis,"Physicians increasingly allow their perceived legal responsibilities to override their clinical judgment. Misunderstandings surrounding the term ""standard of care"" have fostered fears of liability and led to the practice of defensive medicine. Physicians may view the standard of care as a technical or legal obligation, but an optimal standard would be one based on detailed knowledge of the patient's medical history and personal condition. It would include the physician's clinical judgment that integrates specific technical and legal information with clinical experience in patient care. Occasionally, such judgment may conflict with the rulings of a court, which considers technical and legal information without the benefit of clinical judgment. Physicians must be prepared to be advocates for their patients, especially when legal procedures are flawed or harmful.

1857,The systematic influence of messages framed in gains and losses on the interest and use of different types of health behaviors,"Systematically framing health messages in terms of gains or losses influences the behaviors people adopt. Rothman and Salovey proposed that the relative influence of framed messages on gains and losses depends on people's perception of the risk or uncertainty associated with adopting the recommended behavior. Specifically, loss-framed messages are more effective when they promote disease screening behaviors (detection), but gains-framed messages are more effective when they promote health-affirming behaviors (prevention). Two experiments provide a direct test of this conceptual framework. In Experiment 1, participants' willingness to act after reading about a new illness was a function of how the information was framed and the type of behavior promoted. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings with a real health problem: gum disease. Profit-framed brochures increased interest in a plaque-fighting mouthwash, while loss-framed brochures increased interest in a revealing plaque-detecting mouthwash. Research on message framing provides theoretically based guidance for the development of effective health messages.",0,1,

The purpose of this study was to design and implement an effective program to formulate, promulgate, and implement CPGs to foster the development of an evidence-based culture in an Israeli HMO. METHOD: The authors implemented a four-stage program of step-by-step collaborative efforts with academic institutions comprised of developing quantitative tools to assess prescribing patterns, updating CPGs, gathering information from physicians through focus groups and quantitative surveys, and conducting a randomized controlled trial of a two-stage, multifaceted intervention. The test case of this study was the development, dissemination and implementation of a CPG for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult women. Interventions in the form of a conference dissertation and personalized feedback letter were implemented, both individually and in combination, to improve physicians' rates of prescribing the first-line drug, nitrofurantoin, and, in the absence of nitrofurantoin, adherence. to the recommended duration of three days of treatment with ofloxacin. RESULTS: The data generation tools and capabilities designed and built in Phase I of the project were integral components of all subsequent phases of the program. Personalized feedback alone was sufficient to improve guideline adherence rate by 19.4% (95% CI = 16.7, 22.1). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a template for introducing the experimentation component essential to cultivating an evidence-based culture. This process, made up of collaborative efforts between academic institutions and a managed care organization, can be beneficial to other health care systems.",0,1,

While the field is growing, there are only a few training programs for D&I research; this is an important avenue to help build the capacity of the field. To enhance the United States' capacity for D&I research, the National Institutes of Health and the Veterans Health Administration collaborated to develop a five-day training institute for postdoctoral-level applicants aspiring to advance this science .MethodsWe describe the background, objectives, structure, curriculum, application process, trainee evaluation, and future plans for the Training in Dissemination and Implementation of Health Research (TIDIRH). Results The TIDIRH used a five-day residential immersion to maximize opportunities for trainees and faculty to interact. The training-of-trainers-like approach was intended to equip participants with materials that they could easily take back to their home institutions to increase the interest and increased investment in D&I. The TIDIRH curriculum included u n Balance of structured studies, large group discussions and interactive small group sessions. Thirty-five of the 266 applicants for the first annual training institute were accepted from a variety of disciplines, including psychology (12 trainees); medicine (6 interns); epidemiology (5 interns); health behavior/health education (4 interns); and 1 trainee in education and human development, health policy and management, health services research, public health studies, public policy and social work, with a maximum of two people from any institution. The institute was rated very helpful by attendees and six months after the institute, a follow-up survey (97% response rate) revealed that 72% had initiated a new D&I research grant proposal; 28% had received funding, and 77% had used TIDIRH skills to influence peers from different disciplines on D&I research through building local research networks, organizing formal presentations and symposiums, teaching and leading interdisciplinary teams to conduct D&I research. apprentice evaluation at the end of the week's training and six-month follow-up, and plans are to continue and possibly expand TIDIRH in the coming years. Strengths are seen as the residential format, the quality of the faculty and their flexibility in adjusting content to meet learners' needs, and the highlighting of concrete examples of D&I by the local host institution, which rotates lessons annually. learned and plans for the future TIDIR Trainings are summarized H.",0,0,
1861,The UPBEAT program for depression and coronary heart disease: using the UK Medical Research Council framework to design a complex nurse-led intervention for use in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) and increases the incidence of coronary symptoms and death in patients with CHD. Viable interventions are needed for use in primary care to improve mood and cardiac outcomes. The UPBEAT-UK research program has been funded by the NHS's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to explore the relationship between coronary heart disease and depression and to develop a new intervention for use in primary care. METHODS: Using the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines for developing and evaluating complex interventions, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative research to develop a primary care nurse-led intervention to improve mood and cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD and depression. An iterative review of the literature was used to synthesize our empirical work and identify evidence and theory to inform the intervention. RESULTS: We developed a personalized care intervention led by primary care nurses that uses elements of case management to promote self-management. After the biopsychosocial assessment, a personalized care plan is drawn up. Nurses trained in behavior change techniques help patients address issues important to them. The identification and use of existing resources is promoted. The nurse's time is preserved through telephone follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the MRC framework for complex interventions has allowed us to develop an evidence-based intervention informed by patient and physician preferences and established theory. The feasibility and acceptability of this intervention is now being further tested in an exploratory trial.",0,0,
1862,The use of computerized reminders of birthday wishes in the management of diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Although mailed reminders have been used for prevention among general populations, few studies have evaluated their efficacy among chronically ill populations. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of mailed reminders in improving diabetes control. The reminder included a letter from the person's primary care physician (PCP), a self-care manual, a preventive care checklist, and specific recommendations regarding receiving routine checkups and screenings. METHODS: Of 195 PCPs practicing with a large group, 111 agreed to have their adult patients with diabetes randomized to receive the reminder (n=1641) or usual care (n=1668). Using data from automated databases, we fit generalized estimating equations to assess the effect of receipt of reminders on fasting lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin tests, receipt of dilated retinal examination, and frequency of visits during 6 and 12 months after randomization, and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterol. in the year following randomization. RESULTS: Recipients of reminders and usual care did not differ in sociodemographic, clinical, or pretest characteristics. Within 6 months of randomization, reminder recipients were more likely to receive a retinal exam (odds ratio [OR], 1.29""; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1. 12 to 1.49) and a visit for diabetes (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.47).In the 12 months after randomization, reminder recipients were more likely to receive a glycosylated hemoglobin test (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.43), retinal exam (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.41), and visit for diabetes (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.29).At 1 year of follow-up, reminder recipients also tended to have a glycated hemoglobin test that did not reflect poor control (<9, 5%).

1863,The use of laboratory intervention to stop the flow of fresh frozen plasma,"The hospital blood bank tested four laboratory intervention methods in an effort to modify the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Over a one-year period, a utilization audit with feedback to physicians was initiated serially, a recurring educational program was introduced for internal staff outlining guidelines for FFP use, a form was introduced requiring justification of FFP orders and a policy requiring pathologist approval was established. of FFP in patients with normal or absent coagulation studies. Overall, when comparing the period after all forms of intervention (February 1986 to October 1986) with the baseline period before any form of intervention (July 1984 to March 1985), FFP use decreased by 52% vs. a 17% increase in red blood cell usage. It was concluded that blood bankers can drastically alter the use of this product using established methods to modify the ordering behavior of physicians.",0,0,
1864,The use of simulation to train teamwork skills in health care: how far can it go?,"High-fidelity simulation has become a popular technique for training teamwork skills in high-risk industries such as aviation, healthcare, and nuclear power production. Simulation is a powerful training tool because it allows the trainer to systematically control the practice schedule, the presentation of feedback, and the introduction (or removal) of environmental distractions within a safe and controlled learning environment. Unfortunately, many within the training community have begun to use the terms simulation and high-fidelity simulation almost synonymously. This is unfortunate because doing so places too much emphasis on educational technology to the detriment of more substantive issues such as training goals, content and design. It also perpetuates various myths: either simulation fidelity is one-dimensional, or higher levels of simulation fidelity lead to higher training efficacy. The authors propose a simulation fidelity typology and provide examples of how different kinds of simulation have been used successfully to train teamwork skills in high-risk industries. Guidelines are also provided to maximize the usefulness of simulation for training teamwork skills in health care.",0,0,
1865,The use of nicotine inhaler to quit smoking,"PURPOSE: To sensitize nursing professionals (NP) about the nicotine inhaler by providing clinical and practical information on the use of the nicotine inhaler as a treatment option for smoking cessation. DATA SOURCES: This included review and data-driven articles in the medical literature, the clinical practice guideline on tobacco use and dependence, and Medline and Cinahl search engines. The criteria for the search keywords were ""nicotine inhaler"" and ""nicotine replacement therapy"". The initial search was conducted in December 2004. CONCLUSIONS: The nicotine inhaler has been proven to be safe and effective in the treatment of smoking cessation. Clinical trials show that nicotine inhaler is useful alone or as an adjunct to other drug therapies. Current national guidelines recommend that the nicotine inhaler be used in smoking cessation therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The nicotine inhaler is appropriate for many different smokers, including certain types of cardiac patients. NPs may include the nicotine inhaler in a group of nicotine replacement therapies to ensure that smokers are successful in quitting.",0,0,

1867,The value of the 'gentle reminder' on safe medical behavior,"Background Based on the knowledge and methods of cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, we introduced the 'Soft Reminder'. This procedure requires public planning of safety standards and an agreement by all team members to help each other adhere to this plan. Methods Team members agree to gently remind their co-workers whenever they deviate from the safety rule. For the study, we looked at glove use during IV insertion and blood draw. Results and discussion During the 2 years of observation, the safe behavior increased, if the safe behavior before the implementation of the ""gentle reminder"" was 55% in a room""; it increased after 2 months above 80%; 2 months later, it was 83% and 90%;"" and finally stabilized at 90%.

1868,Theory and practice in the management of depressive disorders,"Scientific, professional, and governmental bodies have intensified efforts in recent years to formulate guidelines for the treatment of depression with the goal that medical practice meets these standards and thus improve patient care. 'Evidence-based medicine' requires that medical practice explicitly refer to the best available scientific knowledge. Empirical data on the epidemiology of care suggests that there are important differences between guidelines and usual practice. The lack of detection of mental disorders ranges between 45 and 90%. Only 1 in 10 of those who suffer from depression receive adequate treatment. Treatment is insufficient because prescribed doses are usually too low, because up to 50% of treatments are terminated prematurely, and because patient noncompliance interferes with proper application of treatment. Psychological treatment is provided only in 60% of the cases that need it and is mostly non-specific, that is, listening or giving advice. Furthermore, there are large regional variations in prescribing patterns showing that treatment is influenced by many non-medical factors. Empirical studies show that giving information to clinicians or even measures to improve recognition alone are not enough to make changes in treatment behavior. Only if steps are taken to improve treatment interventions directly, at least for the most severe cases, could a better disease outcome be shown. If one wants to understand the therapist's noncompliance with treatment guidelines, one must first understand the medical decision-making process. Theory of action provides a model that brings together theoretical and experiential knowledge, goal setting, medical and emotional assessment, and operational procedures. Based on this theory, future guidelines should specify the setting for which they claim to be valid, should be empirically tested for feasibility and effects on patient outcome, and should pay due attention to nonmedical factors that have a role. major impact. about medical practice.",0,0,
1869,Therapeutic improvement: category of nursing intervention for patients with a diagnosis of Preparation for the Management of Therapeutic Regimen,"OBJECTIVE: To present a new category of nursing intervention called therapeutic improvement. BACKGROUND: Fewer than half of Americans follow their doctor's recommendations about diet and exercise, even when they are crucial to their health or recovery. It is imperative that nurses consider new ways to promote healthy behaviors. Therapeutic enhancement aims to provide such a novel approach. Traditional intervention techniques focused on education, contracts, social support, and more frequent interaction with physicians appear to be ineffective when used alone. Successful strategies have been multidisciplinary"";"" and have included professional nursing interventions that help patients understand their disease and disease process and help them develop disease management and self-management skills. Therapeutic enhancement incorporates stages of change theory, health engagement theory, motivational interviewing techniques, and instrumentation designed specifically for process evaluation of health-promoting interventions. METHOD: This is a critical review of approaches that, to date, have not been synthesized in a single published article. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the commonly used Stages of Change model, therapeutic enhancement is useful for patients who are in the action stage of change. Using therapeutic enhancement, as well as therapeutic strategies identified in stages of change theory, such as contingency management, helping relationships, counterconditioning, stimulus control, and motivational interviewing techniques, nurses can Significantly increase the chances that patients will move from action to the maintenance stage of change. for a specific health behavior. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Using the nursing intervention category, therapeutic enhancement can increase caregivers' success in helping patients maintain healthy behaviors.",0,0,
1870,Therapy and supportive care of alcoholics: guidelines for professionals,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alcoholism is a widespread disorder in our societies. However, only a small percentage of alcoholics appear in specific psychotherapeutic treatment programs. The vast majority are cared for by general practitioners or experts from other medical specialties where they are treated intensively for their alcohol-induced comorbidities. But the reason for these comorbidities, alcoholism itself, is rarely treated. This article provides guidance for specialists and non-specialists on how to correctly treat these patients in nonspecific treatment programs and how to increase motivation to remain abstinent. In addition, the concept can be quickly and easily integrated into the daily routine of any therapeutic team. METHODS: The literature on therapeutic methods of brief interventions, motivational interviewing and pharmacological relapse prevention was reviewed in PubMed during the years 1991-2005. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The disease burden of alcoholism and alcohol abuse as primary disorders is very apparent but often underestimated even by therapists from various medical disciplines. Systematic studies of the brief intervention method, motivational interviewing, and also pharmacological treatment with acamprosate have shown that these are powerful methods that are easily used to increase the duration of abstinence and the motivation of patients to participate in additional specific treatment. .",0,0,

METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for articles reporting the use of 3DUS or 4DUS in obstetrics. 706 articles were identified, and among them, 525 were actually related to the topic of this review. Articles describing technical developments, clinical studies, reviews, editorials, and studies on fetal behavior or the maternal-fetal bond were reviewed. RESULTS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for the diagnosis of facial abnormalities, especially facial clefts. There is also evidence that 3DUS provides additional diagnostic information in neural tube defects and skeletal malformations. Large studies comparing 2DUS and 3DUS for the diagnosis of congenital anomalies have provided inconclusive results. Preliminary evidence suggests that ultrasonographic tomography may decrease the examination time of obstetric ultrasound examination, with minimal impact on visualization rates of anatomical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for the diagnosis of facial abnormalities, evaluation of neural tube defects, and skeletal malformations. Additional research is needed to determine the clinical role of 3DUS and 4DUS for the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and central nervous system abnormalities. Future studies should determine whether the information contained in the volume dataset, alone, is sufficient to assess fetal biometric measurements and diagnose congenital anomalies.",0,0,

1875,Tics in the pediatric population: pragmatic management,"BACKGROUND: Primary tic disorders, particularly Tourette's syndrome, are very common movement disorders in childhood. However, the management of these patients still poses great therapeutic challenges to medical professionals. METHODS: Based on a synthesis of available guidelines published in Europe, Canada, and the United States, along with more recent therapeutic developments, the authors provide pragmatic guidance to help clinicians decide when and how to treat patients with primary tic disorders. . RESULTS: After a systematic evaluation of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (mainly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first step in treatment is a comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families that addresses the protein phenomenology of tics and associated behaviors, coping mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options. When a more active intervention beyond vigilant monitoring is indicated, hierarchical evaluation of treatment goals (ie, tics versus comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial. Behavioral treatments for tics are restricted to older children and are not readily available in all settings, mainly due to a shortage of well-trained therapists. Pharmacological treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and alpha2A agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety should be monitored. Polypharmacologic and combined behavioral/pharmacologic approaches, as well as neuromodulation strategies, remain under-investigated in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of children with tics and Tourette syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and pediatrics can be helpful in addressing the complex needs of these children.",0,0,
1876,"Training in Brief Smoking Interventions for Chiropractic, Acupuncture, and Massage Practitioners: Protocol for the CAM Scoping Study","BACKGROUND: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US Effective smoking cessation aids are widely available but underused. Brief interventions (BI) for smoking cessation increase quit rates. However, BI training has focused on conventional medical providers, neglecting other health professionals with regular contact with tobacco users. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey found that approximately 20% of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users are tobacco users. Therefore, CAM professionals potentially represent a large untapped community resource for promoting tobacco cessation and the use of cessation aids. Existing BI training is not well suited to the backgrounds and practice patterns of CAM clinicians, because it assumes a conventional biomedical foundation of knowledge and philosophical approaches to health, healing, and the doctor-patient relationship. There is a pressing need to develop and test the effectiveness of BI training that is based on the Public Health Service (PHS) Guidelines for tobacco dependence treatment and that is relevant and appropriate for CAM professionals. METHODS/DESIGN: The CAM Reach (CAMR) intervention is a smoking cessation training and office system intervention designed specifically for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists. The CAMR study uses a single-group, one-way crossover design to examine the impact of the CAMR intervention on smoking-related practice behaviors of CAM practitioners. Primary outcomes included CAM professionals' self-reported tobacco use screening behavior and BI. Secondary outcomes include tobacco users' readiness to quit, quit attempts, use of guideline-based treatments and quit rates, and also non-tobacco users' actions to help another person. to stop smoking. DISCUSSION: CAM practitioners provide care to a significant number of tobacco users. His practice patterns and philosophical approaches to health and healing are well suited to providing BI. The CAMR study is examining the impact of the CAMR intervention on practitioners' tobacco-related practice behaviors, CAM patient behaviors, and documenting important factors for conducting practice-based research in CAM practices. from the real world.",0,0,
1877,Smoking cessation in primary care: maximizing intervention strategies,"The most effective preventive intervention a physician can provide to patients who smoke against heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an empathic, personalized smoking cessation intervention program with long-term support and follow-up. The objective of the intervention must be the total abandonment of the smoking habit. The reduction does not provide direct health benefits to the individual smoker. Interventions are readily available but underutilized, in part due to a lack of medical training and organizational support. This article summarizes current guidelines for smoking cessation interventions as a framework from which to start. The guidelines incorporate the transtheoretical model of patient behavior change and the ""Five A's"": Ask, Advise, Assess, Help, and Organize. Pharmacotherapeutic tools are considered, including nicotine replacement therapies (nicotine gum, patches, nasal sprays, inhalers, and new therapies) and non-nicotine therapies (bupropion, clonidine, nortriptyline, and other antidepressants and anxiolytics). Adherence validation methods, new approaches to tobacco treatment, and addictions that appear in the recent research literature are reviewed. Beyond this framework, specific categories of tobacco users (including smokeless tobacco users), cultural and ethnic minorities, adolescent snuff and bidi users, women, Medicaid recipients, and multi-form users of tobacco require special consideration. With this framework and modifications that may be necessary for specific categories of patients, practicing physicians can incorporate a successful smoking cessation intervention program into daily practice with quit rates approaching 20%.",0,0,

1879,Smoking cessation training for complementary and alternative medicine practitioners: results of a practice-based trial,"INTRODUCTION: Brief behavioral intervention (BI) is a well-established good practice for smoking cessation among conventional health professionals. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners treat a significant number of tobacco users, but do not receive systematic training in BI. The CAM Reach study developed and evaluated a BI smoking cessation/intervention training program of practice system tailored specifically for CAM professionals and evaluated in real-world CAM practices. STUDY DESIGN: Single arm intervention. Data were collected in 2010-2014 and analyzed in 2015. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Private practices of 30 chiropractors, 27 acupuncturists, 42 massage therapists (N=99), in the Tucson, Arizona metropolitan area. INTERVENTION: 8-hour BI Smoking Cessation Continuing Education Workshop, In-Office BI Skills Practice/Assessment, and System Intervention. Training tailored to CAM's practice setting addressed smoking cessation best practices from the US Public Health Service Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seventeen items (assessing practitioner behavior, motivation, and self-efficacy with smoking cessation) comprising three factors, Activity to Quit, Motivation to Quit, and Comfort to Quit without CAM, were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after training by professional self-report. Research staff visited practices at approximately the same intervals to directly observe changes in clinical practice systems. RESULTS: At 3 months, there were significant increases in practitioners' cessation activities, motivation, and confidence in helping patients quit, and comfort with providing information and referrals for smoking-based cessation aids. in guides (p<0.0001).

Tobacco dependence treatment should be a standard part of clinical care for the time available, ranging from a brief intervention at each clinical contact with patients to intensive treatment. Includes psycho-socio-behavioral support and pharmacotherapy. It should apply to all professions of clinical medicine, as recommended by the WHO, mainly doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists, and should be covered by health care systems.

The US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a best practice guideline to encourage all health care providers to intervene with tobacco dependent individuals they encounter. Psychologists may be ideal for implementing brief tobacco use interventions because of their expertise in behavior change strategies and interpersonal counseling skills. This study sought to investigate current tobacco use assessment and intervention practices and perceptions of responsibility for tobacco use intervention among a regional sample of licensed practicing psychologists. The results suggest that most psychologists fall short of the ideal best practices recommended in the practice guideline, and many are unaware of the availability of the guidelines.

1882,Smoking in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: epidemiology and pharmacological approaches to smoking cessation.,"The coexistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine dependence is common. People with ADHD are more likely to start smoking and become dependent on nicotine than their counterparts without ADHD, and recent evidence suggests that they may have a harder time quitting. Little is known about how to best approach the treatment of these comorbidities to optimize clinical outcome. Clinicians treating people with ADHD or nicotine dependence need to be aware of their common coexistence and the need to address both in treatment. This review of ADHD and nicotine dependence provides an overview of the relevant epidemiology, bidirectional interactions, and implications for adjunctive pharmacological and psychosocial treatment. Incorporating the current evidence base and their clinical experience, the authors propose a stepwise approach to the treatment of patients with comorbid ADHD and nicotine dependence. Given the potential for ADHD symptoms to interfere with successful quitting, the first priority is to stabilize ADHD. The first-line pharmacological approach should be a long-acting psychostimulant. Following stabilization of ADHD, motivational techniques should be used to encourage readiness to attempt smoking cessation. In the context of behavioral smoking cessation interventions sensitive to the patient's needs and developmental stage, a pharmacological intervention aimed at smoking cessation can be initiated. The authors recommend varenicline as a first-line agent, given the superior effect size among available drug treatments. ADHD symptoms, as well as nicotine withdrawal and craving symptoms, should be closely monitored during the quit attempt, and adjustments in therapy should be considered if warranted. The authors conclude that while current treatments may be potentially effective for comorbid ADHD and nicotine dependence, more research is needed to explore the complex associations between these disorders and prospectively study combination treatments.",0,0,

Methods: A search of eight bibliographic databases of peer-reviewed publications in English from January 2006 to March 2015. Studies were included if they met the a priori inclusion criteria, which consisted of: 1) quantitative study design and 2) focus on tobacco and nicotine education or training for HCP students and professionals. Two reviewers independently screened all studies for inclusion. Data from included studies were extracted for study characteristics and key outcomes and then critically appraised for methodological quality. Results: 59 studies were included for the narrative synthesis. Two categories emerged: 1) curriculum characteristics (n=10), and 2) education and training interventions (n=49). The included curricular studies identified the following themes: content, intensity, evaluation of competencies and barriers. Study findings on education and training interventions were grouped by education level (pre-licensing, post-licensing, and faculty training), teaching modality, health discipline, and outcomes. HCP and client associates. Conclusion: This comprehensive review suggests that there is a lack of consistency in the characteristics of tobacco and nicotine education and training in HCP. This document provides a valuable categorization of the most frequently used academic curriculum components and discusses interventions in relation to HCP and client outcomes.

1887,Towards Criteria for Pragmatic Measurement in Implementation Research and Practice: A Stakeholder-Driven Approach Using Concept Maps,"Background Advancing implementation research and practice requires valid and reliable measures of the determinants, mechanisms, processes, strategies, and outcomes of implementation. However, researchers and implementation stakeholders are unlikely to use measures if they are not also pragmatic. The purpose of this study was to establish a stakeholder-driven conceptualization of the domains that comprise the pragmatic measure construct. It was based on a systematic review of the literature and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders that generated 47 criteria for pragmatic measures, and aimed to further refine that set of criteria by identifying conceptually distinct categories of the pragmatic measure construct and providing quantitative ratings of the criteria. . Â¯s clarity and importance. Methods Twenty-four stakeholders with implementation practice experience completed a concept mapping activity in which they organized the initial list of 47 criteria into conceptually distinct categories and rated their clarity and importance. Multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis, and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results The 47 criteria were significantly grouped into four distinct categories: (1) acceptable, (2) compatible, (3) easy, and (4) useful. Average clarity and importance ratings will be presented at the category level and individual criteria. Conclusions This study advances the field of implementation science and practice by providing clear and conceptually distinct domains of the pragmatic measure construct. The next steps will include a Delphi process to develop a consensus on the most important criteria and the development of quantifiable pragmatic scoring criteria that can be used to assess the measures.",0,0,
1888,Towards Evidence-Based Medical Statistics. 1: The P-Value Fallacy,"There is a major problem in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and prior research play little formal role in interpreting quantitative results. This phenomenon manifests itself in the discussion sections of research articles and can ultimately affect the reliability of the conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions with certain â€œerror ratesâ€ can be produced, regardless of information external to the experiment. This statistical approach, whose key components are P-values and hypothesis testing, is widely perceived as a mathematically consistent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgamation of incompatible elements, the usefulness of which for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for nearly 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology back to the P-value fallacy, the misconception that a single number can capture both the long-term results of an experiment and the probative significance of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used: the Bayesian factor, which correctly separates long-term behavioral problems from the strength of the evidence and allows integration of prior knowledge with existing knowledge. statistical findings.",0,0,
1889,"Towards a common terminology: a simplified framework of interventions to promote and integrate evidence into health practices, systems and policies","Background There is a wide range of diverse and inconsistent terminology in the field of knowledge translation. This limits the performance of evidence synthesis, impedes communication and collaboration, and undermines knowledge translation of research findings in diverse settings. Improving consistency of terminology could help address these challenges. In 2012, we convened an international working group to explore the idea of developing a common terminology and general framework for knowledge translation interventions. Findings Methods included identifying and summarizing existing frameworks, mapping a subset of those frameworks, and convening a multidisciplinary group to begin working toward consensus. The group considered four possible approaches to creating a simplified framework: merge existing taxonomies, create a framework of intervention mechanisms rather than intervention strategies, use a consensus process to expand on one of the existing models/frameworks used by the group, or develop a new consensus frame of reference. Conclusions The working group chose to draft a new simplified consensus framework of interventions to promote and integrate evidence into health practices, systems and policies. The framework will include four key components: strategies and techniques (active ingredients), how they work (causal mechanisms), how they are delivered (delivery mode), and what they intend to change (intended goals). The draft framework needs to be further developed through feedback and consultation with the research community and tested for usefulness through application and evaluation.",0,0,

1891,Tracheotomy and weaning,"No hypothesis related to respiratory care in the intensive care unit has been more difficult to study objectively than the common belief that tracheostomy hastens weaning from ventilatory support. Tracheostomy might facilitate weaning by reducing dead space and lowering airway resistance, improving secretion clearance, reducing the need for sedation, and decreasing the risk of aspiration. The available evidence indicates that dead space and airway resistance are reduced, although it is less certain that the magnitude of these reductions explains the clinical observation of faster weaning after tracheostomy. Most of the data on this topic comes from laboratory experiments and short-term physiological studies in clinically stable patients, and the available evidence from clinical trials with weaning as the primary endpoint is sparse. A large multicenter trial showed no advantage to early tracheostomy, but showed how difficult it is to get clinicians to manage their patients with regimens that go against their long-held views. The most recent clinical trial found that percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy performed within the first 2 days in patients projected to need >14 days of ventilatory support greatly reduced ventilator and intensive care unit days, and decreased both the incidence of pneumonia as overall mortality, compared with tracheostomy performed after day 14. Conducting such trials is difficult due to investigator and physician bias, inability to predict which patients will actually require prolonged mechanical ventilation, and several other factors. discussed in this article. Tracheostomy probably helps relieve some patients from ventilatory support, but this may be due to its effect on clinical behavior as well as any physiological impact.",0,0,
1892,Tracing the foundations of a conceptual framework for a patient safety ontology,"Background In the work of the World Alliance for Patient Safety on research methods and measures and on the definition of key concepts for an International Classification of Patient Safety (ICPS), it became clear that there was a need to try to understand how the meaning of patient safety and the The concepts relate to existing safety and quality frameworks commonly used in health care. Objectives To develop the concept of patient safety and how it relates to the safety and quality frameworks commonly used in health care and to trace the evolution of the ICPS framework as the basis for the electronic capture of the component elements of patient safety. Conclusion The ICPS conceptual framework for patient safety has its origins in existing frameworks and an international consultation process. Although its 10 classes and their semantic relationships can be used as a reference model for different disciplines, it must remain dynamic in the ever-changing world of healthcare. By expanding ICPS by examining data from all available sources and ensuring rigorous adherence to the latest principles in informatics, a deeper interdisciplinary approach will be progressively developed to address the complex and refractory problem of reducing care-associated harms. medical.",0,0,
1893,Training for general practitioners in prescribing opioids for chronic pain based on practice guidelines: a randomized pilot and feasibility trial,"UNLABELED: This study is a pilot and feasibility study comparing 2 training experiences to improve appropriate prescription of opioids for chronic pain. Both training conditions included education regarding opioid guidelines. After education, 1 condition included training aimed at improving psychological flexibility and the other included training in practical knowledge and skills related to pain management. Eighty-one general practitioners (GPs) participated in the study, each of whom was randomly assigned to one of the training conditions. It was easy to recruit GPs for training. Overall, GPs demonstrated increased knowledge of prescribing opioids for chronic pain and decreased prescribing-related concerns after training. However, no changes were seen in reported prescribing practices or secondary measures of well-being. There were also no significant differences between the training conditions, except for a greater increase in the intention to use the prescription guidelines in the psychological flexibility condition. The feasibility and acceptability of the training methods were generally rated as high. The psychological flexibility condition scored higher than the comparison condition in terms of interest and satisfaction. Finally, psychological flexibility processes before and after training were significantly correlated with measures of GP well-being, providing partial support for the relevance of these processes as a focus in GP training. PERSPECTIVE: A training intervention for GPs that included education on opioid guidelines for chronic pain and psychological flexibility training increased prescribing knowledge and reduced worries, but did not change prescribing behavior or well-being. The training was very acceptable to the GPs but may have been too short to produce any other effects.",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster randomized trial with general practice as the unit of randomization. SETTING General practice in Wales. PARTICIPANTS 53 general practitioners and practice nurses from 27 general practices (one each minus one practice) recruited 1827 patients who tested positive for at least one risk behavior. INTERVENTION Behavior change counseling was developed from motivational interviewing to enable clinicians to improve patients' motivation to change health-related behaviour. Physicians were trained through a blended learning program called Talking Lifestyles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients reporting beneficial changes in at least one of four risk behaviors at three months. RESULTS A total of 1308 patients from 13 interventions and 1496 from 14 control practices were approached: 76% and 72% respectively agreed to participate, with 831 (84%) and 996 (92%) respectively screened eligible for an intervention. There was no effect on the primary outcome (beneficial change in behaviour) at three months (362 (44%) vs 404 (41%), odds ratio 1.12 (95% CI 0.90 to 1, 39)) or on biochemical or biometric measurements at 12 months. months. More patients who had seen trained physicians recalled the health behavior consultation discussion (724/795 (91%) vs. 531/966 (55%), odds ratio 12.44 (5.85 to 26, 46)) and intended to switch (599/831 (72%) vs. 491/996 (49%), odds ratio 2.88 (2.05 to 4.05)). More intervention practice patients reported attempting to change (328 (39%) vs. 317 (32%), odds ratio 1.40 (1.15 to 1.70)), sustained behavior change at three months (288 (35%) vs. 280 (28%, odds ratio 1.36 (1.11 to 1.65)), reporting slightly greater improvements in healthy eating at three and 12 months, in addition to an improvement in activity at 12 months Training cost £1597 per practice DISCUSSION Training primary care clinicians in behavior change counseling using a short blended learning program did not increase beneficial behavior changes reported by patients at three months nor did biometric and biochemical measures improve at 12 months, but it did increase patients' recall of having discussed behavior change with their clinicians, intentions to change, attempts to change, and perceptions of having discussed behavior change with their clinicians. made a lasting change to the three months.

Without compromising fidelity to the model, ACT can serve as an ideal platform from which to deliver primary and behavioral health care to those with complex service needs. Using a case example, this article considers the transformation of the ACT mental health care model into an integrated health care delivery system through the establishment of nursing and primary care partnerships. Specifically, by explicitly expanding and redefining the role of the ACT nurse, well-developed care models such as guided care can provide additional guidance and training to ACT nurses who are uniquely trained and oriented to serve as leader and coordinator. of health integration. efforts",0,0,

DESIGN: Natural experiment with nonparticipating facilities serving as controls. SETTING: Community nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six participating and 353 nonparticipating nursing facilities in North Carolina. INTERVENTION: Two in-person learning sessions, monthly teleconferences, and an email discussion list for 9 months. The package of changes emphasized screening, labeling, and risk factor reduction. MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured by center self-report and graph abstraction (n = 832) before and after the intervention. Fall rates measured with the Minimum Data Set (MDS) were compared with those of non-participating facilities as an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: Self-reported compliance with screening, labeling, and risk factor reduction approached 100%. Plot abstraction revealed only modest improvements in screening (51% to 68%, P < .05), risk factor reduction (4% to 7%, P = .30), and medication evaluation (2% at 6%, P = .34). There was a significant increase in vitamin D prescriptions (40% to 48%, P = 0.03) and a decrease in sedative-hypnotics (19% to 12%, P = 0.04), but no change in the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics or calcium. No significant changes were observed in the proportions of people who fall or in the rates of falls according to the abstraction of the graph (28.6% to 37.5%, P = 0.17), MDS (18.2% to 15 .4%, P = 0.56) or self-report (6.1-5.6 falls/1,000 bed days, P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: Multiple risk factor reduction tasks are implemented infrequently, whereas screening tasks appear to be more easily modified in a real-world setting.

1903,Translation of alcohol screening and brief intervention guidelines to pediatric trauma centers,"BACKGROUND: As part of the American College of Surgeons' verification to be a Level 1 trauma center, centers must have the ability to identify trauma patients with at-risk alcohol use and provide intervention. Despite supporting scientific evidence and national policy statements that encourage alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment (SBIRT), barriers still exist that prevent the integration of SBIRT into clinical care. The study objectives of this multisite translational research study were to identify best practices for integrating SBIRT services into routine care for pediatric trauma patients, measure changes in practice with the adoption and implementation of an SBIRT policy, and define the barriers and opportunities for the adoption and implementation of SBIRT Services in pediatric trauma centers. METHODS: This translational research study was conducted at seven US pediatric trauma centers over a 3-year period. Changes in SBIRT practice were measured through self-report and medical record review at three different phases of the study, namely the adoption, implementation, and maintenance phases. RESULTS: Based on medical record review, at baseline, 11% of eligible patients were screened and received a brief intervention (if needed) at all sites. After completing SBIRT technical assistance activities, the seven participating trauma centers effectively developed, adopted, and implemented SBIRT policies for injured adolescent inpatients. Additionally, across all sites, 73% of eligible patients received SBIRT services after the implementation and maintenance phases. Opportunities and barriers to successful integration were identified.

1907,Trends to Statistical Significance Trap: Likelihood that Nearly Significant P-Value Will Become More Significant with Additional Data,"When faced with a P value that has failed to meet some specific threshold (usually P<0.05), authors of scientific articles may hint at a ""trend toward statistical significance"" or otherwise suggest that failure to achieve statistical significance was due to insufficient data. This paper presents a quantitative analysis to show that such descriptions give a misleading impression and undermine the principle of accurate information. P-values that fail to reach the conventional significance level of PÃ¢â€°Â¤0.05 are regularly reported as moving in that direction. Phrases like Ã¢â‚¬Å""nearly/approaching statistical significance"" or, more tellingly, a ""trend toward statistical significance"" continue to find their way into journal articles with high impact factors.1 In In this article, we examine the mathematical basis for this assumption and assess the extent to which a nearly significant P value can predict movement toward a future significant P value by adding additional data. We also explored the probability that the additional data would lead to a significant result and, finally, how confident one could be that a repeated experiment would independently yield statistically significant results. The clearest context in which to consider the correct interpretation of a p value is within a randomized trial. Fisher described how the ""simple precaution of randomization will suffice to ensure the validity of the test of significance."" Treatment effect may explain any observed difference in outcome between groups. The AP value tells us the extent to which chance alone can explain the observed difference and acts as a ""snapshot"" measure of the strength of the evidence at the end of the trial. As evidence accumulates, conclusions become more firmly grounded. The AP value could easily be imagined as follows Ã¢â‚¬Â¦",0,0,

1909,"Treatment of depression within the HIV ""medical home"": a guided algorithm for antidepressant management by HIV specialist clinicians","People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) experience a higher prevalence of depression compared to the general population, negatively affecting antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and HIV-related outcomes leading to morbidity and the mortality. However, depression in this population often goes undiagnosed and untreated. The current project sought to design an evidence-based approach to integrating depression care into HIV clinics. The chosen model, measurement-based care (MBC), is based on existing guidelines and the largest randomized trial of depression treatment. MBC was adapted to the clinical realities of HIV care for use in a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of depression management in three academic HIV clinics. Tailoring takes into account drug interactions critical to the continued efficacy of ART and can be performed by a multidisciplinary team of non-mental health providers. A treatment algorithm was developed that enables clinically supervised non-physician depression care managers (DCMs) to track and monitor antidepressant tolerability and response to treatment, while supporting clinicians. Non-psychiatric prescribers with the choice and dosage of antidepressants. Quality of care is ensured through weekly supervision of DCMs by psychiatrists. Key areas of flexibility that have been important in implementation have included flexibility in the timing of assessments, accommodating divergences between algorithm recommendations and provider decisions, and accommodating delays in implementation of treatment plans. This adaptation of the MBC model to HIV care has taken into account the critical interactions between antidepressants and antiretrovirals and has facilitated the provision of quality antidepressant treatment within the HIV medical home.",0,0,
1910,"Treating obesity with a novel handheld device, software, and Internet technology in primary care: the SMART motivational essay.","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term motivational effect of a technology-based weight reduction program for obese adults. METHODS: One hundred eleven middle-aged (45.5+/-10.8 years) obese (37.0+/-5.8 kg/m(2)) adults (62% women) were randomly assigned to a usual or experimental care (SMART: self-monitoring and resting metabolic rate technology). The usual care group received a standard nutritional program according to national guidelines. All participants received a comprehensive weight management program consisting of motivational interviewing (MI) sessions and automated behavioral email newsletters. Body weight, blood pressure, and psychobehavioral constructs were assessed over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Completion analysis (n = 80) indicated significant improvement in body weight (-3.9%), systolic blood pressure (-4 mmHg), and all motivational constructs after the 12-week study (p < or = 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the groups at any time period. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, a comprehensive 12-week weight loss program consisting of MI and automated behavioral email newsletters with or without SMART is effective in treating obese adults. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Although both treatment programs were equally effective, clinicians should consider a treatment program that meets the patient's needs.

1912,Treatment of anxiety disorders in primary care practice: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are prevalent in primary care. Psychological treatment is effective but time consuming and there are waiting lists for secondary care. Therefore, interest has grown in developing treatment guidelines that are feasible in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and feasibility of guided self-help, the Dutch College of General Practitioners Guidelines on Anxiety Disorders, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled study of 12 weeks duration with follow-up at 3 and 9 months for primary care patients with panic disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. SETTING: The first two forms of treatment were performed by 46 physicians who were randomly assigned to one or the other form. CBT was performed by cognitive behavioral therapists in a psychiatric outpatient clinic. METHOD: Participants (n = 154) were randomly assigned to one of three forms of treatment. The main outcome measure used was the state subscale of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: All three forms of treatment gave significant improvement between pre-test and post-test, and this improvement remained stable between post-test and follow-ups. The results obtained with the three forms of treatment did not differ significantly over time. The feasibility of the Anxiety Disorders Guidelines was low compared to that of guided self-help. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that primary care patients with prevalent anxiety disorders for whom referral is not considered necessary by the GP can be adequately managed by the GP. Referral to the psychiatric outpatient clinic does not give better results. Guided self-help is easier for the GP to carry out than less structured treatment such as that set out in the Anxiety Disorders Guidelines.",0,0,
1913,Treatment of childhood memories: theory and practice,"With the growing interest of cognitive behavioral therapy in early developmental psychopathology such as personality disorders, there is a greater need for therapeutic methods to more directly treat pathogenic schemas. Exploring and reinterpreting memories of early childhood experiences that are assumed to have contributed to pathogenesis is increasingly seen as a promising way to modify core schemas. Experiential methods seem to be the most effective. This article analyzes two main forms of these methods: (i) imagery with rewriting and (ii) role play, both of children's interactions with key figures. For both, the protocols are provided as guidelines for clinicians and to encourage standardization so that this new field can be opened up for experimental research. Theoretical views on why these methods might be so effective in treating chronic problems that originate in childhood are discussed.",0,0,
1914,Treatment of common 'life event' traumas,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners are confronted daily with patients who have experienced distressing 'life events'. Helping patients through this process can present a significant challenge. OBJECTIVE: This article points to the reactive symptomatology that can be overtly present or hidden in a stressful event and its subsequent reactions, establishes the goal of restoring a person's functioning and their own resources, and provides guidelines on what counseling can do for a patient. DISCUSSION: People trying to cope with a distressing 'life event' or the aftermath of trauma can be helped effectively by early, short-term counselling. Although this task may not be to the liking of the busy GP, many accessible interventions can restore a person's coping capacity and avert the prospect of ongoing and deeper pathology. Many symptoms do not fit the diagnostic categories generally associated with stress disorders. Some may display social engagement issues and social phobia"";"" others may describe low self-esteem, states of distress, relationship dissatisfaction, and maladjustment in key behavioral areas. The task is to help the person gain a different perspective on the distressing event, their own abilities, and the supportive influences around them.",0,0,

Purpose: To determine the benefits and harms of treatments for adults with ME/CFS and to identify future research needs. Data sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases (January 1988 to September 2014)""; clinical trial registries; reference lists and manufacturer information. Study selection: English-language randomized trials of efficacy and adverse effects of ME/CFS treatments Data extraction: Data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and outcomes were extracted and confirmed Study quality was dually rated using of prespecified criteria, discrepancies resolved by consensus Data synthesis: Among 35 treatment trials that enrolled participants primarily By meeting the 1994 Oxford and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CFS case definitions , the immune modulator rintatolimod improved some measures of exercise performance compared with placebo in 2 trials (low-solid evidence ez). Trials of galantamine, hydrocortisone, IgG, valganciclovir, isoprinosine, fluoxetine, and several complementary medications were inconclusive (insufficient evidence). Graded and stepped exercise therapy compared with no treatment, relaxation, or support improved fatigue, function, global improvement, and work impairment in some trials;"" counseling therapies also improved quality of life (evidence of strength low to moderate) Harm was rarely reported in the studies (insufficient evidence) Limitation: trials were heterogeneous and limited by size, number, duration, applicability, and methodological quality Conclusion: trials of rintatolimod, counseling therapies, and graded exercise therapy suggest a benefit for some patients who meet CFS case definitions, while evidence for other treatments and harms is insufficient More definitive studies comparing participants are needed that meet different case definitions, including MS, and that provide subgroup analyzes for the fill research gaps.",0,0,
1916,Treatment of seasonal affective disorder,"Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), winter type, is characterized by regular annual onset of major depressive episodes during the fall or winter, followed by spontaneous remission and sometimes manic or hypomanic episodes during the spring and summer. SAD is clinically important, affecting approximately 2-5% of the general population in temperate climates. Since the first description of the syndrome, investigators have attempted to elucidate the pathophysiologic antecedents of SAD. Bright light therapy has been proposed as the treatment of choice for this disorder. However, numerous studies have also investigated appropriate psychopharmacological treatments for SAD. This report aims to provide an overview of the clinical management and current therapeutic options for SAD.",0,0,
1917,Treatment Services for Children with ADHD: A National Perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize knowledge about treatment services for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trends in services from 1989 to 1996, types of services provided, mix of services, and barriers to treatment. the attention METHOD: A review of the literature and analysis of 2 national surveys of medical practices are presented. RESULTS: There have been major changes in stimulant prescriptions since 1989, and prescriptions now comprise three-quarters of all doctor visits for children with ADHD. Between 1989 and 1996, related services, such as health counseling, for children with ADHD increased 10-fold and diagnostic services increased 3-fold. However, the provision of psychotherapy fell from 40% of pediatric visits to only 25% in the same period of time. Follow-up care also dropped from over 90% of visits to just 75%. Family doctors were more likely than pediatricians or psychiatrists to prescribe stimulants and less likely to use diagnostic services, provide mental health advice, or recommend follow-up care. About 50% of children with identified ADHD who are seen in real-world practice settings receive care that corresponds to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines. Physicians reported significant barriers to providing services for these children, including a lack of pediatric specialists, insurance barriers, and long waiting lists. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in treatment services and clinician variations in service delivery point to important gaps between the research base and clinical practice. Clinical variations may reflect differences in training, inequality in the availability of specialists and location of services, and changes in health care incentives.",0,0,

1919,Activation of anti-smoking advice by doctors: mode of action of an intervention that stimulates advice to quit smoking by doctors,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the mode of action of an intervention (GP desktop resource, GDR) that increased the frequency of general practitioner (GP) advice to quit smoking. METHODS: Analyzes were performed to differentiate between three hypotheses about the mode of action of RDA. That the RDA acts: (1) by altering the attitudes of physicians, (2) independently of attitudes by prompting physicians to intervene with smokers, or (3) by altering the relationship between attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: The GDR was an independent predictor of the number of patients advised to quit smoking (beta = .345, p < .001). Concern about the doctor-patient relationship was the only attitudinal variable that independently predicted giving advice, in this case negatively (beta = -.465, p < .001). Possession of the GDR did not alter physicians' opinion about whether intervening with smokers harmed the physician-patient relationship, but it weakened the relationship between this attitude item and the number of patients advised to stop smoking (beta = . 595, p < .001). for interaction). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that concern about the doctor-patient relationship was an independent predictor of giving advice, whereas in other studies it has simply been flagged as something that GPs express concern about. A simple device designed to trigger action by clinicians appeared to work by mitigating the negative effect of an attitudinal barrier to action. It would be interesting to explore this phenomenon more generally in relation to health promotion activities by health professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Recommendations that GPs engage in health promotion activities with their patients should take into account that GPs' concerns about damaging the doctor-patient relationship may deter them from performing such interventions. The GDR appears to be effective in prompting GPs to advise their smoking patients to stop smoking and its widespread distribution to GPs should be considered.",0,0,
1920,Tumor boards: optimizing the structure and improving the efficiency of the multidisciplinary management of cancer patients worldwide,"Currently, multidisciplinary tumor management boards are held around the world for the management of cancer patients. Studies evaluating its influence on decision-making and patient outcome are limited"";"" however, single center studies reported significant changes in diagnosis and treatment plans. A survey of Arab countries showed widespread use of and reliance on tumor boards for decision-making. A recent multi-institutional survey of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals in the United States found a limited association between the presence of tumor boards and care and outcomes. The Cancer Care Outcomes Surveillance and Research Consortium analyzed the association between tumor panel characteristics and measures of quality of care. Results of overall survival among patients of these physicians participating in tumor boards are ongoing, but preliminary results are described in this article along with a recent survey of international ASCO members on the presence, use, and the influence of tumor joints. Tumor boards enable the implementation of clinical practice guidelines and can help capture cases for clinical trials. Efforts to improve the preparation, structure, and conduct of tumor boards, research methods to monitor their performance, teamwork, and outcomes are also described in this article. The concept of mini-tumor plaques and more efficient methods for MDM in resource-limited countries are also discussed. In suboptimal settings, such as small community hospitals, rural areas, and areas with limited resources, the limits in diagnosis and management can be overcome, or at least improved, with tumor boards, especially with the use of videoconferencing facilities. Studies from the UK demonstrated that special multidisciplinary team (MDT) training led to better team dynamics and communication, improved patient satisfaction and improved clinical outcome. This article also reviews the weight of benefits against the time and effort spent on improving efficiency, patient care, and better time management in the United States and in the international cancer community.",0,0,
1921,Turning Knowledge into Action at the Point of Care: The Collective Experience of Nurses Facilitating the Implementation of Evidence-Based Practice,"BACKGROUND: Facilitation is seen as a way to enable clinicians to implement evidence in practice by solving problems and providing support. Practice development is a well-established movement in the UK incorporating the use of facilitators, but in Canada, the role is more obtuse. Little research has looked at the facilitation process described by people with experience of guideline implementation in North America. OBJECTIVE: To describe the tacit knowledge about facilitation embedded in the experiences of nurses implementing the evidence in practice. METHODS: Twenty nurses from across Canada were intentionally selected to attend an interactive knowledge translation symposium to examine what worked and what didn't in implementing evidence in practice. This study is a further in-depth analysis of the data collected at the symposium that focuses on facilitation as an intervention to improve evidence capture. The critical incident technique was used to obtain examples to examine nurses' facilitation experiences. Participants shared their experiences with each other and completed the initial data analysis and coding collaboratively. Data were analyzed thematically using the constant comparison qualitative inductive approach. RESULTS: A number of factors emerged at various levels associated with the successes and failures of participants' efforts to facilitate evidence-based practice. Successful implementation was related to: (a) focus on a priority issue, (b) relevant evidence, (c) development of strategic alliances, (d) use of multiple strategies to effect change, and (e) characteristics and approach of the facilitator. Negative factors that influenced the process were: (a) poor commitment or ownership, (b) resource shortfall, (c) conflict, (d) contextual issues, and (e) lack of evaluation and sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Factors at the individual, environmental, organizational and cultural levels influence the facilitation of evidence-based practice in real situations at the point of care. With a greater understanding of the factors that contribute to successful or unsuccessful facilitation, future research should focus on examining facilitation interventions designed to address barriers and improve facilitators of evidence capture.",0,0,

Early recognition and intervention can delay the onset of type 2 DM and prevent long-term complications. School nurses have an essential role in implementing the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended screening guidelines to identify youth at high risk for type 2 DM and in implementing student health programs that target positively on the importance of physical activity and healthy eating habits. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, complications, diagnosis and treatment, as well as the recommended guidelines for screening for type 2 DM in children.

1925,Understanding and preventing criminal recidivism among adults with psychotic disorders,"The high prevalence of adults with psychotic disorders in the criminal justice system has received much attention recently, but our understanding of this problem is marked by divergent opinions. Mental health professionals point to deinstitutionalization and our fragmented mental health system as major causes. Criminologists downplay the role of mental illness and hold that people with and without mental illness are arrested for the same reasons. Meanwhile, practice guidelines offer little guidance to clinicians on how to tackle the problem. Drawing on contemporary crime prevention principles, as well as current knowledge of psychotic disorders and their treatment, this article presents a conceptual framework for understanding and preventing criminal recidivism. The framework highlights the importance of individual and service system risk variables and emphasizes the central role of treatment nonadherence as a mediator between modifiable risk variables and recidivism. Building on the conceptual framework described in this article, three intervention elements necessary to prevent recidivism among adults with psychotic disorders are presented: competent care, access to services, and legal influence. Research is needed to further define and test these intervention elements as a basis for future service delivery efforts.",0,0,

1927,Understanding the diagnosis and management of dementia and guideline implementation in general practice: a qualitative study using the domains theoretical framework,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a growing problem causing a substantial burden on patients, their families and society. General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the diagnosis and management of dementia""; however, there are gaps between current and recommended practice. The aim of this study was to explore the reported practice of physicians in diagnosing and management of dementia and describe, terms, proposed explanations for practice that was and was not consistent with evidence-based guidelines.METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs in Victoria, Australia.The domain-theoretical framework ( TDF) guided the data collection and analysis. The interviews explored the factors that hinder and enable the achievement of 13 recommended behaviors. The data was analyzed through thematic and content analysis. This document presents a detailed description of the factors that influence two behaviors, assessing comorbid depression using a validated tool and performing a cognitive assessment f normal. using a validated scale. RESULTS: A total of 30 clinicians were interviewed. Most clinicians reported that they did not assess comorbid depression using a validated tool according to recommended guidance. Barriers included the belief that depression can be adequately assessed using general clinical indicators and that validated tools provide little additional information ('Beliefs about Consequences' theoretical domain); discomfort in using validated tools ('Excitement'), possibly due to limited training and confidence ('Skills'; 'Beliefs about skills'); limited awareness of the need for and forgetting to carry out an evaluation for depression ('Knowledge'; 'Memory, attention and decision processes'). Most reported practicing in a manner consistent with the recommendation to perform a formal cognitive assessment using a validated scale. The key factors that enabled this were awareness of the need for cognitive assessment (""Knowledge""); possess the necessary skills and confidence ('Skills'; 'Ability Beliefs');"" and have adequate time and resources ('Context and Environmental Resources'). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to our knowledge that uses a theoretical approach to investigate the barriers and facilitators to guideline-recommended diagnosis and management of dementia in general practice Has identified key factors that are likely to explain the adoption of the guidelines by GPs The results have informed the design of an intervention aimed at supporting practice change according to dementia guidelines, which is currently being evaluated in a cluster randomized trial.",0,0,
1928,Understanding how physician evaluation produces its effects: a realistic review protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Doctors in the UK are now required to take part in revalidation to maintain their license to practise. The appraisal is a fundamental component of the revalidation. However, objective evidence that screening changes physician behavior and directly results in better patient care is limited. In particular, it is unclear how the evaluation process is supposed to change physician behavior and improve clinical performance. The aim of this research is to understand how and why the assessment of physicians is supposed to produce its effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The realist review is a theory-based, interpretive approach to evidence synthesis. It applies the realist logic of research to produce an explanatory analysis of an intervention, that is, what works, for whom, under what circumstances, in what respects. Using a realist review approach, an initial program evaluation theory will be developed by consulting with key stakeholders in physician evaluation in expert panels (ethical approval not required) and searching the literature to identify relevant existing theories. The search strategy will have a series of phases including a combination of: (1) searching electronic databases, eg, EMBASE, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, ASSIA, (2) searching for 'cited by' articles, ( 3) citation search, (4) contact with authors, and (5) gray literature search. The search for evidence will be iteratively expanded and refocused as the review proceeds. Studies will be included based on their ability to provide data to test the theory of the program. Data extraction will be carried out, for example, by taking notes and annotations at different stages of revision, in accordance with the realist approach. The evidence will be synthesized using realist logic to question the final program theory on the impact of evaluation on the performance of physicians. The results of the synthesis will be written according to the RAMESES guidelines and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations.

1929,Understanding the implementation processes of clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines in pediatric settings: a study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Canada is among the most prosperous nations in the world, but the health and well-being outcomes of Canadian children are shockingly poor. There is some evidence to suggest that these poor health outcomes are due in part to clinical practice variation, which may stem from failure to apply the best available research evidence in clinical practice, also known as knowledge translation ( KT). Surprisingly, clinical practice variation, even for common acute pediatric conditions, is widespread. Clinical practice variation results in unnecessary medical treatments, increased suffering, and higher health care costs. This study focuses on improving health outcomes for common pediatric acute health problems by evaluating strategies that improve KT and reduce clinical practice variation. DESIGN/METHODS: Using a multiple case study design, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from four emergency departments in Western Canada. Data sources will include: pre- and post-implementation focus group data from multidisciplinary health professionals""; individual interviews with local champions, KT intervention providers, and unit/site leaders/managers; survey data from Alberta Context Tool (ACT);"" and aggregated patient outcome data. Qualitative and quantitative data will be systematically triangulated and matrices will be constructed to make comparisons between cases. Explanations on the success or lack of success of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and acceptance of clinical pathways (CPs) will be constructed based on cross-case comparisons. IMPORTANCE: This study will generate new insights into the potential mechanisms and causal factors that shape implementation. Future studies will track the impact of CPG/CP implementation on children's health outcome and health care costs.",0,0,
1930,"Understanding noncompliance with colorectal cancer screening: a case-control study, nested in a randomized trial","Background The main limit to the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening is often poor compliance. We studied reasons for noncompliance and determinants of compliance with fecal occult blood tests in Lazio, Italy. Methods This is a case-control study nested within a trial that tested the effect of test type and provider on adherence to colorectal cancer screening. Non-compliant trial subjects were classified as cases and compliant subjects were classified as controls. We sampled 600 cases and 600 controls matched by their general practitioner, half were invited for screening at the hospital and the other half directly at their general practitioner's office. Cases and controls answered questions about: distance from the test provider, logistical problems, colorectal cancer risk perception, confidence in screening efficacy, fear of results, presence of colorectal cancer in the family, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results About 31% of cases never received the letter offering free screening, and 17% of the sampled population had already been screened. The first reported reason for noncompliance was ""lack of time"" (30%)"";"" the main determinant of adherence was distance from the test provider: odds ratio >30 minutes vs. <15 minutes 0.3 (95% CI = 0.2-0.7). The odds ratio for lack of time was 0.16 (95% CI 0.1-0.26). The effect was stronger if the provider was the hospital (0.03 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.1) rather than the general practitioner (0.3 95% CI = 0.2 to 0.6) . Twenty-two percent of the controls were accompanied by someone to the test. Conclusion To increase compliance, screening programs should involve testing providers that are geographically close to the target population.",0,1,

Some differences in physician behavior over time were also found. Implications for system improvement are discussed.",0,0,
1932,Understanding the practice: factors influencing the management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department: a qualitative study using the Theoretical Domains Framework,"BACKGROUND: Mild head trauma is a common cause of presentation in the emergency department. Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines in this area, there is variation in practice. One of the goals of the Neurotrauma Evidence Translation program is to develop and evaluate a targeted, theory- and evidence-based intervention to improve the management of mild traumatic brain injury in Australian emergency departments. This study is the first step in the intervention development process and uses the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore perceived factors influencing the adoption of four key evidence-based recommended practices for the management of MTI. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with emergency personnel in the Australian state of Victoria. The interview guide was developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore current practice and identify factors that are perceived to influence practice. Two researchers coded the interview transcripts using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants (9 Directors, 20 physicians, and 13 nurses) were interviewed over a seven-month period. Results suggested that (i) prospective assessment of posttraumatic amnesia was influenced by: ""knowledge""; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; skills; social/professional role and identity; and beliefs about abilities; (ii) the Use of criteria developed by guidelines or decision rules to inform the appropriate use of a CT scan was influenced by: knowledge; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision processes; beliefs about abilities ; social influences; skills and behavior regulation ; (iii) providing verbal and written information to the patient about discharge was influenced by: beliefs about consequences; context and environmental resources; memory, attention and decision processes; role and social identity/ professional; and knowledge; (iv) the practice of providing brief information, the follow-up Routine treatment at discharge was influenced by: environmental context and resources; role and social/professional identity; knowledge. edge; beliefs about consequences""; and motivation and goals.

1933,"Understanding the Neurobiology, Assessment, and Treatment of Substances of Abuse and Dependence: A Guide for the Critical Care Nurse","What do I do as an intensive care nurse? Nurses, by virtue of being trained in health promotion and also because they interact with patients, families and communities, have first-hand opportunities to play an active role in primary prevention practice. To prevent the first occurrence of substance abuse, assess community needs, assess facility needs, and identify potential risk. Identify the magnitude of the problem. Intervene early with youth and at-risk populations. Refer patients and their families to mental health specialists. Provide education to patients, families, communities. To reduce occurrences of substance abuse, the practice of secondary prevention requires prompt action in the earliest moments of recognizing a problem and directing patients to early intervention and rehabilitation. Assessment of your patients, brief education, and prompt referral constitute early intervention. To slow the progression of the disease, practice tertiary prevention by providing education, counseling, and support to those affected to achieve and maintain sobriety through medication adherence and counseling and group rehabilitation work. The goal of intervention in the lives of substance users is to stop drug use, prevent relapse, and maintain recovery. After years of research, NIDA has identified 13 fundamental principles for effective drug abuse treatment. 1. Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior. 2. No single treatment is appropriate for everyone. 3. Treatment must be readily available. 4. Effective treatment addresses multiple needs of the individual, not just their drug abuse. 5. It is essential to remain in treatment for an adequate period of time. 6. Counseling (individual and/or group) and other behavioral therapies are the most widely used forms of drug abuse treatment. 7. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. 8. A person's treatment and service plan must be continually evaluated and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs. 9. Many people addicted to drugs also have other mental disorders that need treatment. 10. Medically assisted detoxification in the early stage of addiction treatment alone does little to change long-term drug abuse. 11. Treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective. 12. Drug use during treatment must be continuously monitored, because failures occur during treatment. 13. Treatment programs should screen patients for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, as well as provide specific risk reduction counseling to help patients modify or change treatment regimens. behaviors that put them at risk of contracting or spreading infectious diseases. To truly impact this disease, there is a need to improve identification of risk factors and early identification and early intervention with children and adolescents. The future of neuroscience lies in objective brain scans and genetic testing. More objective measures of addiction and dependence using brain scans and genetic testing may emerge from these approaches. These measures would potentially allow the development of vaccines for specific drugs of abuse and dependence, as well as increasingly selective and effective pharmacological approaches to treatment and a new consensus on the standard of care for substance dependence.",0,0,
1934,Understanding the performance of community health volunteers involved in delivering health programs in underserved areas: a realistic synthesis,"Background Recruitment of community health volunteers (CHVs) to support the delivery of health programs is an established approach in underserved areas and particularly where health inequalities exist due to a shortage of trained human resources. However, there is a paucity of evidence on what works to improve the performance of CHVs. This review aimed to synthesize the existing literature to explain why, how, and under what circumstances intervention approaches to improve VHC performance are most likely to be successful. Methods We perform a realistic synthesis. We identified candidate theories related to our review questions, which then guided the selection, evaluation, and analysis of primary studies. Publications of interest dating from 2008 to 2012 were identified through a systematic search of the PubMed and IDEAS databases. All study designs that examined various aspects of HCV performance in the context of formal organizational settings were considered eligible, and studies that did not provide an explanation of HCV performance in either the findings or the discussion part were excluded. discussion. The data was organized according to its reference to the context, interventions, outcomes and mechanisms to identify the interaction between them. Data synthesis allowed us to determine explanatory patterns within or between studies. Results We identified broad intervention approaches within the 23 articles included in the review: positioning of the CHV within the community, establishment of clear roles, provision of ongoing and skills-based training, incentives, supervision and logistical support for distribution and implementation of chores. The findings provided information on which mechanisms (self-esteem, sense of duty, self-efficacy, sense of being treated fairly) to target when implementing such approaches, and which contextual factors (stable cultural, political and social context and support and intervention closely linked to local health services) create the most favorable conditions for these mechanisms to occur, ultimately contributing to a better performance of the CHV. Four main explanatory patterns around these mechanisms emerged as fundamental to better performance. Conclusions The patterns identified, combined with the assumptions of designers and other stakeholders about how such interventions are expected to work, can be tested through empirical studies to provide useful information for use by program implementers, policymakers, and donors. . and the community",0,0,
1935,"Unemployment and mortality in Denmark, 1970-80","Relative mortality in the period 1970-80 was studied among Danish men and women who were unemployed and employed on the day of the 1970 census. The study population consisted of the total working population in the age range 20-64 years on 9 November 1970, that is, about 2 million employed and 22,000 unemployed. Relative mortality was analyzed using a multiplicative hazard regression model (as a natural extension of the standardized mortality ratio) and a multiplicative regression model with extra-Poisson variance. A significantly higher mortality rate (40-50%) was found among the unemployed after adjusting for occupation, housing category, geographic region, and marital status. Analysis of the five leading causes of death showed an increase in mortality from all causes, but especially from suicide or accidents. In areas where the local unemployment rate was comparatively high, the relative mortality among the unemployed was lower. The increased mortality among the unemployed was interpreted as a consequence of health-related selection as well as increased susceptibility associated with the psychosocial stress of unemployment.",0,0,
1936,Unequal protection of patients' rights: the gap between the university and health ethics committees,"Despite the recommendations of the Cartwright Report, ethical review by health ethics committees has continued in New Zealand without health professionals having to recognize their dual role as health professionals investigating their own patients. On the other hand, universities explicitly identify doctor/researcher-patient relationships as potentially generating role conflict problems. This stems from the recognition within the university sector itself that professor/researcher-student relationships are plagued by such conflicts. Although it is noted that similar unequal relationships exist between health researchers and their patients, patients/subjects do not receive the levels of protection afforded to students/subjects. In this article we argue that the difference between universities and health research is the result of the failure of the Standard Operating Code for Ethics Committees to explicitly recognize the vulnerability of the patient and the conflict of interest in the dual roles of doctor/researcher. Of the health. We end the article by recommending that the Ministry of Health consider rewriting the Standard Operating Code of Ethics Committees, in particular the rewriting of article 26 of the Standard Operating Code of Ethics Committees.

DESIGN/METHODS: The data source is the 2003 nationally representative Survey of Current Medicare Beneficiaries. The sample included community-living fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older (N = 10,523). Based on self-reported alcohol use, respondents were classified as nondrinkers, guideline drinkers, exceeding monthly but not daily limits, or heavy episodic drinkers. Using survey and claims data, influenza vaccination, pneumonia vaccination, glaucoma screening, and receipt of mammograms were determined. Bivariate and logistic regression analyzes were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 70.3% received influenza vaccination and 49% received glaucoma screening during the year, 66.8% received pneumonia vaccination, and 56.2% of women received a mammogram for 2 years. In logistic regression, heavy episodic alcohol consumption was associated with a lower probability of receiving the service compared to consumption within the guidelines: influenza vaccination (OR 0.75, CI 0.59-0.96) , glaucoma screening (OR 0.74, CI 0.58-0.95) and vaccination against pneumonia (OR 0.75, CI 0.59-0.96). Non-drinkers, compared with those who reported drinking within guidelines, were less likely to receive a mammogram (OR 0.83, CI 0.69-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Heavy episodic alcohol use is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving various preventive services. Practitioners should be encouraged to screen all older people for alcohol use and, in addition to appropriate intervention, consider older people who report episodes of heavy drinking to be at increased risk of not receiving preventive services.",0,0,
1938,Unintended effects of a near-alert stop-computerized medical order entry to prevent a drug interaction: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background The effectiveness of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems has been modest, largely because physicians frequently override electronic alerts. Methods To assess the efficacy of a near ""snap stop"" CPOE prescription alert aimed at reducing concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at 2 academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1,981 physicians were assigned to either an intervention group that received a near-sudden-stop alert or a control group that received standard practice. The duration of the study was from August 9, 2006 to February 13, 2007. Results The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the drug that activates the alert within 10 minutes after activation) was 57, 2% (111 of 194 hard stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045-0 ,33). However, the study was terminated early due to 4 unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment in 2 patients and a delay of warfarin treatment in another 2 patients. electronic hard stop as part of an inpatient CPOE system appeared to be extremely effective in changing prescription. Intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in 4 patients who required immediate pharmacological treatment These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring of unintended consequences of the program matic interventions aimed at improving prescribing habits.",0,1,
1939,Update on interventions focused on clusters of symptoms: what has been tried and what have we learned?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although clusters of symptoms are recognized by clinicians and researchers, attention has focused on relieving a single symptom. This review summarizes the recent literature on interventions that focus on alleviating clusters of symptoms in cancer patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Twelve intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria were published in 2011-2012. The time frame was extended to 2009-2012 and 24 studies met the criteria: 18 in early stage and 6 in patients with advanced stage cancer. Various cognitive behavioral therapy, complementary therapy, and exercise interventions have shown positive results in relieving a variety of symptom clusters in various cancer types. Most psychoeducational interventions that used traditional formats or those combined with automated medical alerts demonstrated effectiveness in reducing a variety of clusters. The groups that included fatigue and anxiety or depression were reduced by exercise in early-stage patients and by methylphenidate in late-stage patients. Current NIH-funded studies R01 verified trends in the types of interventions being tested. SUMMARY: Few interventions have been tested and found to be effective in relieving specific symptom clusters in patients with early and advanced cancer. Future research should further our understanding of the mechanisms that initiate concurrent symptoms. Mechanism-targeted interventions need to be identified and tested in homogeneous samples with specific symptom clusters. Interventions need to be replicated before guidelines can be established.",0,0,
1940,Update on pediatric hyperlipidemia,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to review the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI) guidelines on the detection and management of hyperlipidemia in children and discuss concerns of critics regarding universal screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have shown favorable trends in serum lipid levels among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 years between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010. Mean total cholesterol (TC) decreased from 165 to 160 mg/dl, and the prevalence of elevated TC decreased from 11.3 to 8.1%. However, between 2007 and 2010, about 20% of children ages 9 to 11 had low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or high non-HDL cholesterol. This warrants further evaluation according to NHBLI guidelines. ABSTRACT: The NHBLI guidelines present clinicians with a balanced perspective for the detection and management of hyperlipidemia in children. These guidelines provide a schematic approach to help primary care physicians make treatment decisions. The hope is that this will lead to decreased health care system spending and better overall health through early identification and intervention.",0,0,
1941,"American medical researchers, the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial, and the Nuremberg Code. A review of the findings of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments","The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE), established to review allegations of abuse of human subjects in federally sponsored radiation research, was charged with identifying appropriate standards for evaluating the ethics of human radiation experiments. the Cold War. A central question for ACHRE was to determine what role, if any, the Nuremberg Code played in the standards and practices of American medical researchers. Based on evidence from the ACHRE Oral History of Ethics Project and extensive archival research, we conclude that the Code, at the time it was enacted, had little effect on leading medical researchers involved in research involving human subjects. Although some clinical investigators raised questions about conducting research with human subjects, the medical profession did not address the issue until the 1960s.",0,0,
1942,Use and effect of health information exchange: a systematic review,"Background: Health information exchanges (HIEs) are on the rise in the United States and are incentivized by government policy. Purpose: To systematically review and appraise the evidence for the use and effect of HIE in clinical care. Data sources: Selected databases from January 1, 2003 to May 31, 2014. Study selection: Hypothesis tests or quantitative studies in English of various types of data sharing between non-affiliated organizations for use in care clinic that addressed health outcomes, efficiency, utilization, costs, satisfaction, HIE use, sustainability, and attitudes or barriers. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed in duplicate. Data Synthesis: Low-quality evidence from 12 hypothesis-testing studies supports an effect of HIE use in reducing use or costs in the emergency department. Direct evidence that providers used HIEs was reported in 21 studies involving 13 different HIE organizations, 6 of which were located in New York, and generally showed use in less than 10% of patient encounters. Results from 17 sustainability studies suggest that approximately a quarter of existing HIE organizations are considered financially stable. Findings from 38 studies on attitudes and barriers showed that providers, patients, and other stakeholders view HIE as valuable, but barriers include technical and workflow issues, cost, and privacy concerns. Limitation: publication bias, possible selective reporting of results, and paucity of reporting on context and implementation processes. Conclusion: Use of health information exchange likely reduces emergency department use and costs in some cases. Effects on other outcomes are unknown. All stakeholders say they value HIE, but there are many barriers to acceptance and sustainability. A small portion of operational HIEs have been evaluated and more research is needed to identify and understand success factors.",0,1,
1943,Use and avoidance of seclusion and restraint: Consensus statement of the American Association of Emergency Psychiatry Project Seclusion and Restraint Beta Task Force.,"Issues related to reducing and/or eliminating episodes of seclusion and restraint for patients with behavior problems in crisis clinics, emergency departments, inpatient psychiatric units, and specialized psychiatric emergency services continue to be an area of concern and debate. among mental health physicians. An important underlying principle of the BETA (Best Practices in Assessment and Treatment of Agitation) Project is non-coercive de-escalation as the intervention of choice in the management of acute agitation and threatening behavior. In this article, the authors discuss various aspects of seclusion and restraint, including review of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services guidelines governing its use in behavioral health settings, the negative consequences of this intervention for patients, and staff, and a review of quality improvement and risk management strategies that have been effective in decreasing its use in various treatment settings. An algorithm designed to help the clinician determine when isolation or restraint is most appropriate is presented. The authors conclude that specialized psychiatric emergency services and emergency departments, due to their treatment of primarily acute patients, may not be able to completely eliminate the use of seclusion and restraint events, but these programs can adopt strategies to reduce their utilization rate. interventions.",0,0,

1945,Use of a clinical decision support tool to improve adherence to guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: skin and soft tissue infections.,"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) with abscess are commonly seen in the emergency department (ED) setting. Given the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus-aureus (MRSA)-related abscesses, appropriate evidence-based decisions are essential to ensure treatment success. Provider adherence to clinical guidelines for the treatment of SSTIs with suspected MRSA remains inconsistent in terms of prescriptive practice related to antibiotic selection, wound culture, and patient discharge recommendations regarding the use of infection control techniques. . Evidence indicates that the use of clinical decision support (CDS) tools is valuable in improving provider awareness and adherence to clinical guidelines. This study was conducted to examine whether developing a CDS tool to guide order entry for treatment of MRSA-related SSTIs and integrating it into the electronic medical record program would improve providers' compliance with the Consensus Guidelines of North Carolina for the management of suspected cases in the community.

1946,Using a computer to detect and respond to clinical events: Its effect on clinical behavior.,"computer was used to prospectively detect and suggest responses to simple medication-related events as reflected in a computerized record in a prospective, randomized study from a diabetes clinic with primary care responsibility. There were two categories of events/suggestions: when the last observation of a test required for drug monitoring was too old, the computer suggested a repeat; and when an abnormality with therapeutic implications was detected, the computer suggested a specific change in therapy. Physicians responded to 36% of events in the first category with computer-assisted reminders and 11% without (p < 0.0001);"" they responded to 28% of events in the second category with computer-assisted and 13% without her (P < 0.026).For the most clinically significant of these second-category events, the difference was even greater: 47% with and 4% without computer assistance (P < 0.0004).I think computer detection and response ( in the form of reminders) to simple clinical events will change the behavior of the doctor.",1,1,
1947,The use of a computerized guideline for glucose regulation in the intensive care unit improved both adherence to the guideline and glucose regulation.,"Objective: To measure the impact of a computerized guide for glucose regulation in an ICU. Design: A randomized controlled trial with an off-on-off design. Methods: We implemented a glucose regulation guide in an intensive care unit on paper during the first study period. During the second period, the guide was applied randomly in paper or electronic format. In the third period, the guide was available only on paper. Measurements and results: We analyzed data from 484 patients. During the intervention period, the control group included 54 patients and the computerized intervention group included 66 patients. The two guideline-related outcomes consisted of adherence to: (a) glucose measurement time recommendations and (b) insulin dose recommendations. We measured clinical impact as the proportion of time that glucose levels fell within the target range. In the first study period (on paper), 29.0% of the samples were taken at the optimal time; during the second period, this increased to 35.5% for paper protocols and 40.2% for computerized protocols. Late (suboptimal) sampling occurred for 66% of glucose measurements in the first study period, for 42% of paper-based and 28% of computer-based protocol samples in the second period, and for 50.0% of the samples in the third study period. In the first study period, compliance with insulin dosing guidelines was 56.3%;"" in the second period it was 64.2% for paper protocols and 77.3% for computerized protocols, and decreased to 42.4% in period 3. For the second study period, the time a patient's glucose values were within the target range improved for both the control (52.9%) and the computerized groups (54 .2%) compared to the first study period (44.3%) and the third period (42.3%).Conclusion: Implementation of a computerized version of a guideline significantly improved the timeliness of measurements and glucose level regulation for critically ill patients compared to implementing a printed version of the guideline.",1,1,
1948,Use of a decision aid that includes information on overscreening to support informed choice about breast cancer screening: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Screening mammography may reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, most women are unaware that inconsequential diseases can also be detected by screening tests, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Our aim was to investigate whether including information about breast cancer overscreening in a decision aid would help women in their 50s make an informed decision about breast screening. Methods We conducted a community-based parallel-group randomized controlled trial in New South Wales, Australia, using a randomized cohort of women aged 48 to 50 years. Recruitment for the study was done by phone""; women were eligible if they had not had a mammogram in the past 2 years and had no significant personal or family history of breast cancer. Using a computer program, we randomly assigned 879 participants to an intervention decision aid (comprising evidence-based quantitative and explanatory information on overscreening, reduction in breast cancer mortality, and false positives) or a control decision aid (comprising information on reduction in breast cancer mortality and false positives) allocation The primary outcome was informed choice (defined as adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening intentions), which we assessed by interview telephone about 3 weeks after randomisation.The primary outcome was analyzed in all women who completed n follow-up relevant interview questions fully This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Tria ls Register, number ACTRN12613001035718. Results Between January 2014 and July 2014, 440 women were assigned to the intervention group and 439 to the control group. 21 women in the intervention group and 20 controls were lost to follow-up; another ten women assigned to the intervention and 11 controls did not answer all questions about attitudes. Therefore, 409 women in the intervention group and 408 controls were analyzed for the primary outcome. 99 (24%) of 409 women in the intervention group made an informed decision compared to 63 (15%) of 408 in the control group (difference 9%, 95% CI 3-14; p=0 0017) . Compared with controls, more women in the intervention group reached the adequate general knowledge threshold (122/419 [29%] vs 71/419 [17%]; difference 12%, 95% CI 6–18; p<0 0001), fewer women expressed positive attitudes toward screening (282/409 [69%] vs. 340/408 [83%]; 14%, 9–20; p<0 0001), and fewer women had intention to undergo screening (308/419 [74%] vs. 363/419 [87%]; 13%, 8–19;"" p<0 0001). When conceptual knowledge alone was considered, 203 ( 50%) of 409 women in the intervention group made an informed decision compared to 79 (19%) of 408 in the control group (p<0 0001) Interpretation Information on breast cancer overdetection provided within a decision aid increased the number of women who made an informed decision about breast screening Being better informed could mean women are less likely to choose screening.",0,1,
1949,Use of a fall prevention practice guideline for community-dwelling older people at risk of falls: a feasibility study,"BACKGROUND: Falls among older people occur frequently and are a common cause of physical and psychological morbidity and health care utilization. The problem can be attributed to a complex interplay between environmental, behavioral, and health-related factors. To ensure a consistent, evidence-based approach, a practical guideline for fall prevention in community-dwelling older people at risk of falls was developed. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of integrating a fall prevention practice guideline into the daily practice of 4 primary health care disciplines, i.e. general practitioners, nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists. METHODS: This was a descriptive study conducted by 10 local health networks located in Flanders. The subjects involved in the study were 99 primary care workers and 1142 elderly patients (65 years or older) who lived in the community and who could get up from a chair and move around independently. For 6 months, primary care workers implemented our 3-part fall prevention guideline (case finding, in-depth multifactorial assessment, and interventions). After the 6-month test phase, participating primary care workers were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the feasibility of using the guideline in daily practice. RESULTS: The mean time used to carry out the guideline was 32.0+/-14.0 min. The health workers of the 4 disciplines considered that the search for cases was their responsibility. The picture was different for risk factor assessment and interventions. Although 87.5% considered fall prevention to be an important topic, health workers from different disciplines could not agree on how to integrate the prevention guide into daily practice. The perceived barriers to implementing the guideline were lack of time (57.3%), low motivation of the target population (53.3%), and insufficient cooperation among health workers (37.3%). CONCLUSION: A guide can be used to initiate the integration of prevention strategies in daily practice. Case search is feasible for all disciplines. Multifactorial assessments and interventions require specific task assignments, multidisciplinary cooperation, and clear communication.",0,0,
1950,Use of action plans to increase provision of smoking cessation care by general practitioners: role of specificity and plan enactment,"Background Strategies are needed to help general practitioners (GPs) promote smoking cessation as recommended by guidelines. This study examines whether the quality of action planning among GPs improves their delivery of smoking cessation care. Methods The efficacy of a 1-hour training program was examined in a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 49 GPs. GPs who followed the training (intervention group"";"" n?=?25) formulated action plans related to i) asking about smoking, ii) giving advice to quit smoking and iii) organizing follow-up of smokers motivated to quit smoking. Doctors also formulated a coping plan to meet smokers who are not motivated to quit. The quality of these plans (plan specificity) was rated and, 6 weeks after training, GPs reported on the performance of these plans (plan implementation). Multilevel regression analyzes were used to examine the effects of plan specificity and plan implementation on patient-reported smoking cessation activities of GPs in the intervention group (n = 1632 patients) compared with the control group (n = 1769 patients). Results Compared to the control group, GPs who formulated a highly specific action plan during the training asked their patients about smoking more often after the training than before the training (OR 2.11, CI 95%: 1.51 to 2.95). GPs were more likely to have asked patients about smoking after training compared to before training when they had enacted a highly specific formulated action plan (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2, 04 to 4.64). The effects of GP plan specificity and plan enactment on asking the patient about smoking were more prominent among GPs who, at baseline, intended to provide smoking cessation care. Conclusions A very specific action plan formulated by a GP about when, how and who will ask patients about smoking had a positive effect on GPs asking patients questions about smoking, especially when these professionals also reported enacting this plan. This effect was most prominent among GPs who intended to provide smoking cessation care before the intervention. Training in designing personalized coping plans is recommended to further augment GP advice to quit smoking and organize follow-up support to quit smoking.",1,1,
1951,Using an Internet portal to improve community-based pediatric ADHD care: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a quality improvement program in improving pediatricians' adherence to existing evidence-based practice guidelines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Forty-nine community pediatricians in 8 practices participated in a cluster randomized trial. Practices were matched based on the number of pediatricians and the proportions of patients receiving Medicaid. Medical records of a random sample of ADHD patients from each of the participating pediatricians were reviewed at baseline and at 6 months. All practices participated in 4 training sessions, which included educational conferences and office flow modification workshops. Clinics were then given access to an ADHD Internet portal that allowed parents, teachers, and pediatricians to enter information (eg, rating scales) about patients, after which the information was scored, interpreted and formatted in a report style that was useful for the assessment and treatment of patients with ADHD. Physicians evaluated their practice behaviors quarterly and addressed areas of poor performance. RESULTS: Pediatricians in the intervention group, compared with those in the control group, demonstrated significantly higher rates of many ADHD care practices recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, including collecting parent ratings (d of Cohen = 0.69) and the teacher (d = 0.68). scales for the assessment of children with ADHD, use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria (d = 0.85), and use of teacher rating scales to monitor responses to treatment (d = 1 .01). CONCLUSION: A quality improvement intervention that can be widely disseminated through the use of Internet-based information technology significantly improved the quality of ADHD care in pediatric community settings.",0,0,

1954,Warfarin use at discharge among patients with acute ischemic stroke and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation, and previous studies have shown underuse of anticoagulation for these patients in China. We try to explore the reasons and underlying factors that currently affect the use of warfarin in China. METHODS: From June 2012 to January 2013, 19,604 patients with acute ischemic stroke were admitted to 219 urban hospitals that voluntarily participate in the China National Stroke Registry II. Multivariate logistic regression models using the generalized estimating equation method were used to identify patient/hospital factors independently associated with warfarin use at discharge. RESULTS: Among 952 patients with acute ischemic stroke with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 19.4% were discharged on warfarin. The risk of bleeding (52.8%) and patient refusal (31.9%) were the main reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation. Larger/teaching hospitals were more likely to prescribe warfarin. Older patients, heavy drinkers, patients with a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at admission were less likely to receive warfarin, while patients with a history of heart failure and a normalized ratio between 2.0 and 3.0 during hospitalization were significantly associated with warfarin use at discharge CONCLUSIONS: The rate of warfarin use remains low among patients with ischemic stroke and known nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China. Hospital size and academic status along with patient age, heart failure, heavy alcohol use, hospital international normalized ratio, and admission stroke severity were independently associated with warfarin use to high. There is much room for improvement for secondary stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China.",0,0,

INTERVENTION: Newton MessagePad equipped with custom software (called ""AsthMonitor"") that aids in the documentation of clinical findings and provides guideline-based recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, 3 users gave very positive overall ratings, while 6 users were neutral. Most used the documentation features at the same time as care. Except for the recommendations to administer oxygen (which were not supported by evidence), users found the recommendations appropriate and appreciated the reminders.

1956,"Using ""Nudge"" Principles for Order Set Design: A Before and After Evaluation of an Electronic Prescribing Template in Critical Care","Objective Computerized order sets have the potential to reduce clinical variation and improve patient safety, but the effect is variable. We sought to assess the impact of changes in the design of an established order on the delivery of chlorhexidine and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) mouthwash to patients in the intensive care unit. Methods The study was carried out at the University Hospitals of Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, UK. Our intensive care unit uses a clinical information system (CIS). All medications and fluids are prescribed with the CIS and the medication and fluid charts are stored in a database. Chlorhexidine mouthrinse was added as a default prescription to the prescription template in January 2010. HES was removed from the prescription template in April 2009. Both interventions were available for manual prescription throughout the study period. We performed a database review of all eligible patients for each intervention before and after changes to option settings within the prescription system. Results: 2231 ventilated patients were identified as suitable for treatment with chlorhexidine, 591 before the intervention and 1640 after. 55.3% were prescribed chlorhexidine before the change and 90.4% after (p<0.001). 6199 patients were considered at the HES intervention, 2177 before the intervention and 4022 after. The mean volume of HES infused per patient decreased from 630 mL to 20 mL after the switch (p<0.001) and the percentage of patients receiving HES decreased from 54.1% to 3.1% (p<0.001). These results held up well over time. Conclusions The presentation of options within an electronic prescription system influenced the delivery of evidence-based interventions in a predictable manner and the effect was well sustained. This approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness of computerized order sets.",1,1,
1957,Using a Taxonomy of Behavior Change Techniques to Identify Active Ingredients in Trials of Implementation Interventions for Diabetes Care,"BACKGROUND: The methodological guidelines for the intervention report emphasize the detailed description of the content of the intervention. Despite this, systematic reviews of implementation quality improvement (QI) interventions continue to be limited by a lack of clarity and detail regarding the content of the intervention being evaluated. Our aim was to apply the newly developed Taxonomy of Behavior Change Techniques version 1 (BCTTv1) to trials of implementation interventions to control diabetes to assess the ability and utility of this taxonomy to characterize active ingredients. METHODS: Three psychologists independently coded a random sample of 23 trials of health system, provider, and/or patient-focused implementation interventions from a systematic review that included 142 such studies. Intervention content was coded using BCTTv1, which describes 93 behavior change techniques (BCTs) grouped into 16 categories. We supplement the generic coding instructions within BCTTv1 with decision rules and examples from this literature. RESULTS: Less than a quarter of the putative BCTs were identified within BCTTv1. For implementation interventions targeting providers, the most commonly identified BCTs included the following: adding objects to the environment, cues/cues, instruction on how to perform the behavior, credible source, goal setting (outcome), feedback on the outcome of the behavior and social. support (practical). For implementation interventions that are also directed at patients, the most frequently identified BCTs included the following: cues/cues, instruction on how to perform the behavior, information on health consequences, restructuring of the social environment, addition of objects environment, social support (practical), and goal setting (behavior). The BCTTv1 mapped well to implementing interventions directly targeting clinicians and patients and could also be used to examine the impact of system-level interventions on clinician and patient behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The BCTTv1 can be used to characterize active ingredients in implementation intervention trials and provides content specificity beyond that given by broader intervention labels. Identifying BCTs may provide a more useful means of accumulating insights into the content used in trials of implementation interventions, which may help better inform replication efforts. Furthermore, prospective use of a taxonomy of behavior change techniques to develop and inform intervention content would further help build a cumulative science of effective implementation interventions.",0,0,
1958,Using a Planned Behavior Theory Framework to Explore '5 Critical Moments' Hand Hygiene Beliefs Among Australian Hospital Nurses,"BACKGROUND: Improving hand hygiene among healthcare workers (HCWs) is the single most effective intervention to reduce healthcare-associated infections in hospitals. Understanding the cognitive determinants of hand hygiene decisions for HCWs with increased patient contact (nurses) is essential to improve compliance. The objective of this study was to explore the beliefs of hospital nurses associated with performing hand hygiene guided by the 5 critical moments of the World Health Organization (WHO). Using the Planned Behavior Theory belief-base framework, we examine the attitudinal, normative, and control beliefs that underpin nurses' decisions to perform hand hygiene according to recently implemented national guidelines. METHODS: Thematic content analysis of qualitative data from focus group discussions with hospital registered nurses from 5 wards in 3 hospitals in Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: important advantages (protection of the patient and oneself), disadvantages (time, damage to the hand), referents (support: patients, colleagues""; ""lack of support: some doctors), barriers (being too busy, situations of emergency) and facilitators (accessibility of sinks/products, training, reminders). There was some ambiguity regarding the relative importance of handwashing after contact with the patient environment. CONCLUSIONS: The belief base of planned behavior theory provided a useful framework to systematically explore the beliefs underlying nurses' hand hygiene decisions according to the 5 critical moments, allowing comparisons with previous belief studies. . A commitment to improve nurses' hand hygiene practice in the 5 Moments should focus on individual strategies to combat distraction from other tasks, peer-based initiatives to foster a sense of shared responsibility, and management-driven solutions to address problems. of staff and resources. Hand hygiene after touching a patient's environment remains the most neglected compliance opportunity.",0,0,

It is proposed that the advanced practice nurse (APN) is in a key position to introduce and support this intervention in health organizations to promote the successful implementation of EBP.",0,0,
1960,Use of computerized clinical decision support for the detection of latent tuberculosis infections.,"Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines recommending screening for high-risk groups for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The aim of this study was to determine the impact of computerized clinical decision support and web-based guided documentation on LTBI detection rates. Design Prospective, non-randomized intervention study. Setting and participants Participants were 8,463 patients seen at two community public health center outpatient primary care clinics in late 2002 and early 2003. Intervention CDC LTBI guidelines were codified into a decision support system computerized clinics that provided an alert recommending further LTBI risk assessment if certain guideline criteria were met (born in a high-risk TB country and age <40). A web-based guided documentation tool was provided to facilitate proper compliance with the LTBI screening guideline and to promote accurate documentation and assessment. Baseline data was collected for 15 weeks and study phase data was collected for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures Adequate detection of LTBI according to CDC guidelines based on chart review. Results Among the 4135 patients who were registered during the post-intervention phase, 73% had at least one risk factor defined by the CDC and 610 met the alert criteria (born in a country with high risk of TB and minors 40 years) for the potential detection of LTBI. Adherence to the LTBI screening regimen improved significantly from 8.9% at baseline to 25.2% during the study phase (183% increase, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated that computerized clinical decision support using alerts and guided web-based documentation increased screening of high-risk patients for LTBI. This type of technology could lead to improved screening for LTBI in the United States and also promises better care for other chronic and preventative conditions.",0,1,
1961,Using Implementation Intentions to Teach Practitioners: Changing Practice Behaviors Through Continuing Education,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of implementation intentions in increasing the use of a practice behavior among mental health professionals who attended a one-day continuing education class. METHODS: Seventy-eight professionals were randomly assigned to one of two classes of psychiatric advance directives. One class incorporated instruction in implementation intentions (N=40) and the other class did not (N=38). Implementation intent training involved participants describing the best time and place to use a physician-guided procedure to help consumers complete a psychiatric advance directive. Use of the physician-guided procedure was the dependent variable in this study. The use of the procedure in practice was evaluated three months after the class through an electronic self-report survey. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two class conditions in participant characteristics or pre- or post-class knowledge and intentions to use the procedure. Fifty-four participants (69%) responded to the three-month follow-up survey, indicating that they had used the professionally guided procedure. Results from the follow-up survey showed that, overall, those who attended the class that incorporated implementation intentions used the practitioner-led procedure much more often than those in the other class (80% vs. 58%). The effect of implementation intentions on practitioner-guided procedure utilization was evident among practitioners whose post-class intentions were high but lower than the median for the overall sample (chi(2)=7.1, df=1, p<.01). Implementation rates among professionals with the highest post-class intentions were equivalent in the two class conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating implementation intentions into continuing education classes may increase the use of the practices taught in these classes among well-motivated professionals.",1,1,

1963,Using paper-based chart-based clinical reminders to improve adherence to lipid management guidelines,"BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to apply a paper-based clinical reminder to improve adherence to lipid guidelines. METHODS: Coronary heart disease (CHD) patients without lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were recruited and medical records were reviewed. Eligible subjects were randomized"";"" a clinical reminder indicating the current standards and local insurance policy was stamped on the paper chart in the study group, but not in the control. The primary outcome was LLT re-enrollment at the 6-month follow-up period, and the secondary endpoint was the LLT composite outcome or lipid profile control. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were assigned to the study group and 102 to the control group. The primary outcome showed no difference at the end of 6 months (OR: 1.70, P=0.248, 95% CI: 0.69-4.19). The secondary end point was significantly higher in the reminder group (OR: 2.81, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.57-5.04). CONCLUSION: A clinical reminder based on paper cards that provides updated clinical recommendations could modify the behavior of the physician and improve attention to lipid levels. However, its effect cannot be transformed into an increase in LLT or a decrease in low-density lipoprotein level due to local policy restriction.",1,1,
1964,Use of Pathology-Specific Laboratory Profiles in Clinical Pathology to Reduce Request for Inappropriate Testing – Two Audit Cycles Completed,"BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have shown that although well prepared, Consensus Guidelines have failed to change clinical practice. In the Castelnovo ne Monti health district (Reggio Emilia, Italy), it became necessary for GPs and clinical pathologists to work together to jointly define laboratory profiles. METHODS: Observational study with two retrospective audit cycles on test request forms, in a primary care setting. The goals of the study were to develop pathology-specific laboratory profiles and increase the number of provisional diagnoses on laboratory test request forms. A Multidisciplinary Multiprofessional Interhospital Task Force developed pathology-specific laboratory profiles for more effective test ordering. After 8 training sessions using a combined strategy with multifaceted interventions, all 23 general practitioners (GPs) in the test district (Castelnovo ne Monti) tested the ""profiles""; the 21 doctors in Puianello district were the control group. , all physicians in both districts participated in the trial All laboratory tests for both health care districts are performed at the laboratory located in the trial district Baseline and 1-year audit performed in both districts on physician request forms RESULTS: Seven specific pathologies Outpatient laboratory profiles were developed In the year after the first audit cycle: 1) the number of tests requested in the test district was clearly lower than in the previous year above, with a decrease of about 5% (p < 0.001); 2) the provisional diagnosis on the application forms was 52.8 % in the test district and 42% in the control district (P < 0.001); 3) the decrease in the number of tests in each application form was much more marked in the t district rial (8.73 vs. 10.77; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The first audit cycle showed a significant decrease in the number of tests ordered in the test district alone. The combined strategy used in this study improved prescription compliance for most of the physicians involved. The presence of the clinical pathologist is considered an added value.",0,0,
1965,Use of second-generation antidepressants to treat depressive disorders: an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline,"Description: The American College of Physicians developed this guideline to present the available evidence on the pharmacological management of the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, subsyndromal depression, and accompanying symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, or depression. autonomic symptoms, using second-generation antidepressants. Methods: Published literature on this topic was identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007. limited to English. -linguistic studies in adults over 19 years of age Search keywords included terms for depressive disorders and 12 specific second-generation antidepressantsbupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine and their specific trade names.This guideline rates t The evidence and recommendations using the American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline rating system. Recommendation 1: The American College of Physicians recommends that when clinicians choose a drug therapy to treat patients with acute major depression, they select second-generation antidepressants based on adverse effect profiles, cost, and patient preference (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate- quality evidence). Recommendation 2: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians assess the patient's status, therapeutic response, and adverse effects of antidepressant therapy on a regular basis, beginning within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy (Grade: Strong recommendation ; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians modify treatment if the patient does not have an adequate response to pharmacotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks after initiation of therapy for major depressive disorder (Grade: Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 4: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians continue treatment for 4 to 9 months after a satisfactory response in patients with a first episode of major depressive disorder. For people who have had 2 or more episodes of depression, an even longer duration of therapy may be beneficial (Grade: Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).",0,0,
1966,Using Shared Goal Setting to Improve Access and Equity: A Mixed Methods Study of the Good Goals Intervention in Child Occupational Therapy,"Background Access and equity in child therapy services can be improved by directing clinicians' use of resources toward specific goals that are important to patients. A practice change intervention (entitled Â¡Â®Good GoalsÂ¡Â¯) was designed to achieve this. This study investigated the uptake, adoption, and possible effects of that intervention in occupational therapy services for children. Methods Mixed methods case studies were conducted (n = 3 services, including 46 therapists and 558 children). The intervention was delivered over 25 weeks through face-to-face training, teamwork notebooks and Â¡Â®tools for changeÂ¡Â¯. Data were collected before, during, and after the intervention on a variety of factors through interviews, a focus group, case note analysis, routine data, document analysis, and investigator observations. Results Factors related to recruitment and adoptions were: mode of implementation of the intervention, competing demands on therapists' time, and service manager leadership. Service managers and therapists reported that the intervention: helped therapists establish shared rationale for clinical decisions; increased clarity in service delivery and improved interactions with families and schools. Over the study period, the therapists' behaviors changed: identify goals, odds ratio 2.4 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.8); agreement goals, 3.5 (2.4 to 5.1);"" assessing progress, 2.0 (1.1 to 3.5).

1967,Use of standardized patients to measure the professional performance of physicians,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature of inaccuracies likely to occur when using standardized patients (SP) to measure physician behavior and to assess the potential impact of these inaccuracies on estimates of physician performance. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. PLACE: Family doctor offices. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen people, each representing one of two patient scenarios, made a total of 179 visits to 92 family physicians participating in a separate randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of an educational workshop on implementation of preventive guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy of SPs' representation of assigned scenarios and accuracy of their coding of physician performance, determined on the basis of audiotapes of visits and correlated with indicators of physicians' preventive practices. RESULTS: Accuracy of patient scenario representation was 84.8% for male SPs and 93.5% for female SPs. Inaccuracies in representation had no impact on physician performance scores. The accuracy of medical performance coding was 90.5% for female SPs (kappa = 0.66) and 90.1% for male SPs (kappa = 0.68). Coding inaccuracies occurred most frequently for assessment of alcohol consumption and advice against smoking. CONCLUSION: PS can provide valid information on the professional performance of physicians. However, the standardization of their activities should not be taken for granted. It may be more difficult to obtain standardized coding for counseling activities, an aspect of physician visits for which SPs are particularly well suited.",0,0,
1968,Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to understand adherence to multiple evidence-based indicators in primary care: a qualitative study,"Background There are recognized gaps between evidence and practice in general practice, an environment that poses particular implementation challenges. We previously discussed guideline recommendations to derive a set of ""high-impact"" indicators based on criteria that include the potential for significant patient benefit, scope for improved practice, and measurability using routinely collected data. routine. Here, we explored health professionals' perceived determinants of adherence to these indicators, examining the extent to which the determinants were indicator-specific or potentially generalizable across indicators. Methods We interviewed 60 general practitioners, nurse practitioners and practice managers in West Yorkshire, UK, about adherence to four indicators: ""avoiding risky prescriptions""; treatment targets in type 2 diabetes; blood pressure targets in treated hypertension; and anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. The interview questions were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Data were analyzed using frame analysis. Results Professional role and identity and environmental context and resources ranked high across all indicators, while the importance of other domains, for example, beliefs about consequences, social influences, and knowledge, varied across indicators. . We identify five metathemes that represent broader organizational and contextual factors common to all indicators. Conclusions TDF helped elicit a wide range of reported determinants of adherence to 'high impact' indicators in primary care. It was more difficult to pinpoint which determinants, if targeted by an implementation strategy, would maximize change. The metathemes broadly underscore the need to align the design of interventions targeting general practices with higher level supports and broader contextual considerations. However, our findings suggest that it is feasible to develop interventions to promote the adoption of different evidence-based indicators that share common features while including content-specific adaptations.",0,0,
1969,Using the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) Database: How Do Physicians Really Search?,"OBJECTIVES: Physicians and patients increasingly access information through Internet searches. This study aimed to examine physicians' current search behavior when using the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) database to examine search engine use and ways it could be improved. METHODS: Web log analysis of the TRIP database, a metasearch engine covering 150 health resources, including MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and a variety of guidelines, was performed. The term connectors used in the searches were studied and the search behaviors of 9 users were observed when working with the TRIP database. RESULTS: Of 620,735 searches, the majority used a single term and 12% (n = 75,947) used a Boolean operator: 11% (n = 69,006) used ""AND"" and 0.8% (n = 4941) used ""OR"". Of the elements of a well-structured clinical question (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), population was used most often, while fewer searches included intervention. The comparator and the result were rarely used. Participants in the observational study were interested in learning how to formulate better searches. CONCLUSIONS: Web log analysis showed that most searches used a single term and no Boolean operators. The observational study revealed that users were interested in performing efficient searches, but did not always know how to do it. Therefore, better training or better search interfaces are required to help users and enable more effective searching.",0,0,
1970,Using theory to improve low back pain care in primary care for Aboriginal Australians: a mixed-method single-cohort pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) care is frequently discordant with research evidence. This pilot study evaluated changes in low-back pain care following a theory-based systematic intervention in a rural Australian Aboriginal Health Service. Our goal was to improve three aspects of care: reduce inappropriate radiological imaging referrals for low back pain, increase patient psychosocial assessment, and increase the provision of information on low back pain self-management to patients. METHODS: Three interventions to improve care were developed using a four-step approach. systematic implementation approach. A mixed-methods pre/post cohort design assessed changes in all three behaviors using a clinical audit of low-back pain care over a six-month period before intervention and then after implementation. In-depth interviews elicited the perspectives of the general practitioners involved. (GP). The qualitative analysis was guided by the theoretical framework of the domains. RESULTS: The proportion of patients receiving guideline-inconsistent imaging referrals (GICI) improved from 4.1 GICI per 10 patients to 0.4 (95% CI for rate decrease: 1.6 to 5.6) among GPs involved in intervention Among non-participating GPs (substitute/part-time doctors who started after the intervention) the rate of GICI increased from 1.5 to 4.4 GICI per 10 patients (95% CI for the rate increase: 0.5 to 5.3). There was a modest increase in the number of patients receiving information on self-management of low-back pain from participating clinicians and no substantial change in psychosocial assessments of patients by any of the participants; however, the physicians qualitatively reported that their behaviors had changed. Knowledge and beliefs about consequences were important behavioral domains related to changes. Environmental and resource factors, including protocols for substitute staff and clinical tools integrated into patient management software, were identified as future strategies. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic intervention model resulted in partial improvements in low back pain care. The determinants of practice change among GPs were increased knowledge of clinical guidelines, education provided by someone considered a reliable source of information, and awareness of the negative consequences of inappropriate practices, especially radiological imaging on outcomes. from the patients. problem that arose and will be an important future challenge.

DESIGN Postal survey using a questionnaire booklet together with a letter from the general practitioner. Non-responders received two reminders at two-week intervals. The SF-36 questionnaire was retested on a subsample of respondents two weeks after the first mailing. SETTING Two general practices in Sheffield. PATIENTS 1980 patients aged 16 to 74 years randomly selected from the two practice lists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Scores for each health dimension on the SF-36 questionnaire and the Nottingham Health Profile. Response to questions about recent use of health services and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS The response rate of the SF-36 questionnaire was high (83%) and the completion rate of each dimension exceeded 95%. Considerable evidence was found for the reliability of the SF-36 (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.85, reliability coefficient greater than 0.75 for all dimensions except social functioning) and for construct validity in terms of distinguishing between groups. with expected health differences. The SF-36 was able to detect low levels of poor health in patients who had scored 0 (good health) on the Nottingham Health Profile. CONCLUSIONS The SF-36 is a promising new instrument for measuring health perception in the general population. It is easy to use, acceptable to patients, and meets strict criteria for reliability and validity. Its use in other contexts and with different disease groups requires further investigation.",0,0,
1973,Variations in GP decisions to investigate suspected lung cancer: a factorial experiment using multimedia vignettes,"Introduction Lung cancer survival is low and comparatively poor in the UK. Patients with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer commonly present to primary care, but it is unclear how general practitioners (GPs) distinguish which patients require further investigation. This study examined how clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of patients influence physicians' decisions to initiate lung cancer investigations. Methods A factorial experiment was conducted among a national sample of 227 English GPs using vignettes presented as simulated consultations. An interactive multimedia website simulated the key features of consultations using actors (""patients""). GP participants made online management decisions for six 'patients', whose sociodemographic characteristics varied systematically across three levels of cancer risk. In low-risk vignettes, no investigation was indicated (i.e., ordered chest x-ray, CT scan, or referral to a respiratory consultant)""; in medium-risk vignettes, investigation might be appropriate; in high-risk vignettes, definitely indicated investigation Each 'patient' had two symptoms related to lung cancer: one voluntary and one elicited if GPs asked Variations in the likelihood of investigation were examined using multilevel logistic regression Results GPs decided to investigate the lung cancer in 74% (1000/1348) of vignettes Likelihood of investigation did not increase with cancer risk Investigations were more likely when GPs asked for information about symptoms that ""patients"" had but did not volunteered (adjusted OR (AOR) = 3.18, 95% CI 2.27 to 4.70 However, GPs they failed to search for this information in 42% (570/1348) of cases.

1976,Violence in general practice: a study of the opinions of general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE To study the scope of abuse and violence directed at general practitioners during the exercise of their professional duties and to categorize the characteristics of such aggression. DESIGN Retrospective survey of the opinions of a large sample of general practitioners using a piloted postal questionnaire. SETTING All medical practices in the West Midlands. SUBJECTS A total of 1093 general practitioners (40.6% of the total sample) who responded to the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of aggressive incidents experienced by general practitioners over a 12-month period and the incidence of various triggers. RESULTS Although the response was low, 40.6%, this study is the largest published database on aggression towards family doctors. In total, 687 (62.9%) of the respondents had experienced abuse or violence in the previous 12 months, with 191 (17.5%) experiencing some form of abuse at least once a month and 11 (1%) they had experienced verbal abuse every month. day. Even assuming that all non-respondents did not experience violence of any kind, patient aggression affects 25.5% of GPs in the West Midlands. For those physicians who had experienced patient aggression, the annual incidence of one event per general practitioner was 2.42. In total, 96 (14%) of these general practitioners thought that aggression was increasing. A total of 1,520 (91.3%) of all incidents consisted of verbal abuse or threats without a direct physical act. Surgery was the most frequent place of aggression, with 942 (56.6%) incidents"";"" however, 90 (62.5%) of the assault or injury incidents occurred during home visits and 22 (66%) of the injuries were received during night calls.

CONCLUSIONS Violence against general practitioners is common and may be increasing. Some of the precipitants of aggression are potentially avoidable and practices must make strenuous efforts to identify such factors and remedy them. Staff training in interpersonal skills and in recognizing anxious or intoxicated patients is essential and should be complemented by consideration of surgical design and repair. Physicians must avoid delays for patients by rearranging reservation policies or the times and duration of surgeries. Victims of aggression must be followed up.

1977,'We can only do what we have the means to do' General practitioners' views on primary care for older people with complex health problems,"BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change, general practitioners (GPs) are increasingly needed to care for older people with complex health problems. Little is known about physicians' subjective assessments of required changes. Our goal is to explore how general practitioners view their mandates and professional capabilities to provide comprehensive care for older people with complex health problems. Does training or experience in geriatrics influence views? Can barriers be detected for the implementation of changes in the primary care of older people with complex health problems? METHODS: Prior to a controlled intervention study on case management for older patients in the primary care setting (OMAHA II), this qualitative study included 10 general practitioners with varying degrees of geriatric qualification. Semi-structured and audio-recorded interviews were conducted. Full interview transcripts were analyzed starting with open coding based on cases and case descriptions. The emerging thematic structure was enriched with comparative dimensions through repeated case comparisons and developed into a multidimensional typology of viewpoints. RESULTS: Based on the themes emerging from the data and their presentation by the general practitioners interviewed, we were able to identify three different types of views on primary care for older people with complex health problems: 'maneuvering along across the boundaries of competence', 'Herculean task' and 'cooperation and networking'. Viewpoint types differ in role perception, perception of their own professional domain, and action patterns with respect to cooperation. One guy shows a strong correspondence with a geriatrician. Across all groups, there is a shared concern about the availability of sufficient resources to meet the challenges of primary care for older people with complex health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Limited financial resources, lack of cooperative networks, and attitudes appear to be barriers to ensuring better primary care for older people with complex health problems. To overcome these barriers, training in geriatrics is likely to have a positive impact, but must be complemented by regulations related to reimbursement. Above all, general practitioner care for older people with complex health problems needs a conceptual framework that provides guidance on their specific role and contribution and care networks. For example, it is essential that general practice guidelines be more explicit regarding the management of older people with complex health problems.",0,0,
1978,Web-based computer adaptation for practicing nurses to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines: a study protocol for a randomized controlled effectiveness trial,"BACKGROUND: Dutch practice nurses adhere suboptimally to evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines. Web-based computer adaptation could be effective in improving compliance with the guidelines. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the development of a web-based computer-adapted program and the design of a randomized controlled trial testing its (cost) effectiveness. METHODS: Based theoretically on the I-Change model and self-determination theory, and on the results of a qualitative needs assessment among practicing nurses, a personalized web-based program was developed that includes three modules with personalized advice, a online forum, modules with up-to-date information on smoking cessation, frequently asked questions (FAQs) and project information, and a counseling checklist. The effects of the program are evaluated by comparing an intervention group (access to all modules) with a control group (access to FAQs, project information, and counseling checklist only). Compliance with smoking cessation guidelines and behavioral predictors (ie, intention, knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, social influence, action, and coping planning) are measured at baseline and at 6 and 12-month follow-up. In addition, the indirect effects of the program on smokers' quit rates and the number of quit attempts are assessed after 6 and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This article describes the development of a web-based adherence support software for practicing nurses and the study design of a randomized controlled trial testing its (cost) effectiveness. This program potentially contributes to improving the quality of smoking cessation care in Dutch general practices. If proven effective, the program could be adapted for use by other health professionals, increasing the public health benefits of better cessation counseling for smokers.",0,0,
1979,Web-based interventions for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: a systematic review and future directions.,"Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BIT), the application of psychological and behavioral interventions through the use of technology, provide the opportunity for clinicians to deliver care through a means that overcomes a number of treatment barriers. Web-based interventions are a subset of BITs that are being developed as promising alternatives for treatment delivery and face-to-face follow-up for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). A systematic review of the literature resulted in five empirical studies of web-based interventions for UC and CD. Furthermore, an informal search on a popular search engine yielded limited currently available web-based interventions for UC and CD patients. Despite being an ideal population for the development and dissemination of online interventions, UC and CD patients have far fewer treatment options compared to other behavioral health problems. However, given the growing body of research involving web-based interventions for other conditions, researchers and clinicians focusing on the management and treatment of UC and CD have the advantage of being able to use the BIT model, a existing conceptual framework for the development of web-based interventions. interventions for both conditions. The BIT model is presented and applied to the treatment of UC and CD, as well as a technology development program, Purple, and usage guidelines to guide clinical researchers in the future development, evaluation, and dissemination of BIT for UC and CD patients.

Next, an email was sent to all emergency personnel indicating the percentage of patients with antibiotics within 4 hours of arrival. The names of people who administered antibiotics in less than 1 hour were highlighted. This study compared antibiotic time for 11 months before and 11 months after starting this intervention. RESULTS: There were 281 patients in the control cohort, and 37 met the exclusion criteria, leaving 244 for analysis. There were 342 patients in the intervention cohort and 40 met the exclusion criteria, leaving 302 for analysis. Median time from arrival to CXR order decreased significantly from 61 to 47 minutes (p < 0.001). The median time interval from the request for chest radiography to the administration of antibiotics did not change significantly (92 to 88 minutes, p = 0.294). The overall median time from arrival to antibiotic administration decreased significantly from 162 to 146 minutes (p = 0.018). The percentage of patients with antibiotic administration within 4 hours increased from 77.5% to 86.1% (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Weekly email reminders listing performance of antibiotic stewardship recommendations are associated with increased adherence to a clinical guideline.",1,1,
1981,Weight Care Project: Attitudes and capacity of health professionals to assess body weight status - study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Health professionals working in primary care and public health have the opportunity to address issues of body weight status with their patients through face-to-face contact. The objectives of this all-Ireland project are: 1. to assess the current attitudes, practices/behaviours and knowledge of key groups of health professionals about body weight status""; 2. to assess the capacity of professional groups to identify body weight status in both adults and children Health professional groups include: (a) community-associated public health nurses (b) school public health nurses (c) physicians bedside and practice nurses (primary care);"" and (d) occupational health nurses (workplace) from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. METHODS/DESIGN: This multidisciplinary, all-Ireland project follows a mixed methods approach using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, and consists of four components:1. Literature review - to explore the role of health professionals in managing obesity through spontaneous intervention in a variety of health promotion settings.2. Telephone interviews and focus groups: to obtain an in-depth view of the opinions of health professionals when evaluating body weight status.3. Survey (primarily online but also paper based) - to determine health professionals' current attitudes, practices/behaviors and knowledge in assessing body weight status.4. Online Assessment Study: An interactive online program will be developed to assess the ability of health professionals to identify body weight status in adults and children. DISCUSSION: This project will assess and report on the attitudes, current practices/behaviours and knowledge of key groups of healthcare professionals in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland about body weight status and their ability to identify weight status body in both adults and children. The results of this project will generate recommendations for clinical practice in obesity management, which can inform policy guidelines.",0,0,
1982,"Weight Maintenance: Challenges, Tools, and Strategies for Primary Care Physicians","Obesity is recognized as a chronic disease and one of the main health challenges we face today. Weight loss can be achieved through lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical interventions, but weight maintenance remains a lifelong challenge for people with obesity. Guidelines for the management of obesity have highlighted the role of primary care providers (PCPs). This review examines the long-term results of clinical trials to identify effective weight maintenance strategies that PCPs can use. Due to the broad nature of the topic, a structured PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant research articles, peer-reviewed reviews, guidelines, and articles published by regulatory agencies. Trials have shown the benefit of sustained weight loss in the management of obesity and its comorbidities. Maintaining 5-10% weight loss for >/= 1 year is known to improve many comorbidities. Weight maintenance with lifestyle modification, while challenging, is possible but requires long-term support to reinforce diet, physical activity, and behavioral changes. The addition of pharmacotherapy to lifestyle interventions promotes greater and more sustained weight loss. Clinical evidence and recently approved pharmacotherapy have provided PCPs with improved strategies to help their patients maintain weight loss. Further studies are needed to assess the translation of these strategies to clinical practice.",0,0,
1983,Weight Matters: An Approach to Childhood Overweight in General Practice,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, childhood obesity now rivals asthma as the most prevalent chronic childhood health condition. The last 2 decades have shown a rapid increase in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity with no signs of this trajectory leveling off. Primary care is increasingly recognized as a forum in which to address this growing public health problem. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the epidemiology of childhood overweight and obesity in Australia and its associated physical and psychosocial morbidities. Discusses the current evidence base and resources for the definition, research, and management of childhood obesity and describes an approach in the primary care setting. It also reports on a recently developed GP-led intervention to reduce overweight in primary school-age children: the Live, Eat and Play (LEAP) project. DISCUSSION: There are currently clear clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of overweight and obesity in childhood in primary care. The feasibility of these guidelines and the availability of the necessary resources to deliver them is still unclear. The LEAP project proposes an effective intervention carried out by general practitioners to address this vital and complex issue.",0,0,
1984,Well Balanced: 8 Steps to Wellness for Adults with Mental Illness and Diabetes,"Serious mental illness places an enormous burden on clients, their families, and medical and behavioral health care providers. The concurrence of diabetes with mental illness can further compromise daily functioning. Psychiatric nurses can make a significant difference in improving the health and medical outcomes of this client population. A partnership was developed between the University of Rochester School of Nursing and the Western New York Care Coordination Program to test a new nursing model for adults with serious mental illness and diabetes mellitus. The Well Balanced program incorporated health promotion, disease management, nursing care management, and evidence-based practice guidelines into 8 Steps to Wellness for a community-based mental health population. During an intervention period of 16 visits, psychiatric nurses interacted with 74 clients. As a result of the program, clients experienced improvements in their hemoglobin A1C and health risk status and reported a high degree of satisfaction with the Well Balanced program.",0,0,
1985,WellDoc Mobile Diabetes Management Randomized Controlled Trial: Change in Clinical and Behavioral Outcomes and Patient and Physician Satisfaction,"BACKGROUND: Fewer than 63% of people with diabetes meet the professional guideline goal of hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, and only 7% meet combined goals for blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the impact on A1c of a cell phone-based diabetes management software system used with web-based data analysis and therapy optimization tools. Secondary objectives examined healthcare provider (HCP) adherence to prescribing guidelines and assessed HCP adoption of the technology. METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from three community medical practices for a 3-month study and randomized evenly. The intervention group received cell phone-based software designed by endocrinologists and CDEs (WellDoc Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD). The software provided real-time information on patients' blood glucose levels, displayed patients' medication regimens, incorporated hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia treatment algorithms, and queried additional data needed to assess diabetes control. Patient data captured and transferred to secure servers was analyzed by proprietary statistical algorithms. The system sent computer-generated records (with suggested treatment plans) to HCPs of intervention patients. RESULTS: The mean decrease in A1c for intervention patients was 2.03%, compared to 0.68% (P < 0.02, one-sided) for control patients. Of the intervention patients, the HCP titrated or changed medications in 84% compared to controls (23%, P=0.002). HCPs of intervention patients reported that the system facilitated treatment decisions, provided organized data, and reduced logbook review time. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 diabetes using the WellDoc software achieved statistically significant improvements in A1c. HCP and patient satisfaction with the system was clinically and statistically significant.",0,0,
1986,What are the attitudes of mental health specialists regarding the recommendations of the guidelines for the treatment of depression in young people?,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine potential barriers to the use of evidence-based guidelines for youth depression in a tertiary specialist mental health service, as part of an initiative to implement evidence-based practice within the service. METHODS: This was a qualitative study that took a social constructionist perspective using focus groups. The focus groups, carried out with all the doctors (doctors and health allies), were audio recorded, transcribed and a thematic analysis was carried out. Clinicians were asked about barriers to implementing four key recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. RESULTS: Barriers existed at (i) the individual clinical level”; (ii) the clinical level regarding the presentation of young people”; and (iii) the level of service. The key barrier at the individual clinician level was a stated belief that the guidelines were not relevant to young people presenting for service, with little evidence to guide practice. Related, the main barrier regarding clinical presentation was the severity and complexity of this presentation, which often makes it difficult to deliver interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). At the service level, the lack of integration with primary and secondary level care made sequencing interventions according to guideline recommendations difficult. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear imperative to develop the evidence base to ensure that effective treatments are researched and disseminated for young people up to 25 years of age with serious and complex disorders that include comorbid conditions, suicide risk, and psychosocial difficulties. Furthermore, this work has highlighted the need for greater investment in models of care that ensure integration between existing primary and secondary care and improved specialized early intervention mental health services for young people.",0,0,
1987,What do general practitioners think and do about prostate cancer screening in Australia?,BACKGROUND: Men seek advice from their general practitioner (GP) about the merits of prostate cancer screening. This study aimed to examine how GPs' clinical knowledge and experience influenced their position on prostate cancer screening. METHODS: A total of 13 focus groups with 77 general practitioners were established. Focus group discussions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts were analyzed by two researchers through thematic analysis. RESULTS: GPs were evenly split between those who proactively screen men for prostate cancer and those who do so only at the request of the patient. GPs had limited knowledge of recently published evidence from prostate cancer screening trials. DISCUSSION: Effective methods to increase GPs' knowledge of evidence-based recommendations and potentially changing clinical behavior are required to promote evidence-based decision-making by GPs and their patients.,0,0,
1988,What do patients and families know about problems and failures in care?,"Objective To understand what patients and families know about problems and failures in health care. Design Qualitative, semi-structured and open interviews were carried out with 39 patients and 80 relatives about their experiences of incidents in the third level of health. Nineteen interviews involved more than one respondent, giving a total of 100 interviews. Participants were recruited through advertisements in large-format print media and national tabloids (43%), with the help of the health services where the incidents occurred (28%), through invitations sent by two marketing companies on the Internet (27%) and by consumers. organizations (2%). Setting Interviews were conducted in the homes of respondents or by telephone. One participant emailed her answers to the questionnaire. Results The analysis of the interview data revealed: (1) a considerable knowledge on the part of the patients and relatives about the risks, problems and incidents of the health services""; (2) the understanding of the interviewees about the opportunities of improvement of care""; and (3) the challenges that patients and family members face when trying to negotiate their knowledge and points of view with health service personnel. Conclusion Patients (and their families) need access to structured processes that ensure dialogue with health service personnel about perceived risks, problems, and incidents. Such a dialogue would reveal patients' and family members' questions and knowledge about opportunities for improvement, and minimize the risk of their questions and knowledge being ignored.",0,0,
1989,What do people with mental illness need to quit smoking? Perspectives from Mental Health Consumers and Providers,"OBJECTIVES: Forty-one percent (41%) of people in the US who report recent mental illness also smoke cigarettes. Tobacco use among this population is associated with up to 25 years less life and excess medical comorbidity compared to the general population. Although research shows that anti-smoking interventions can be effective for people with mental illness, they are not commonly used in clinical practice. The current study explored how to tailor evidence-based smoking cessation interventions to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social challenges faced by people with mental illness. METHODS: Ten focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured discussion "";"" 5 for adult mental health consumers (n = 62) and 5 with physicians and mental health administrators (n = 22). Content analysis was used to organize the topics into categories. RESULTS: Five thematic categories were found: (1) Barriers to treatment, (2) Resources and infrastructure, (3) Negative influences on smoking behavior, (4) Knowledge deficits, and (5) Treatment needs. CONCLUSIONS: These results are instructive in the development of appropriate smoking cessation services for this population. Specifically, these data have been incorporated into a smoking cessation toolkit for mental health providers and have informed the development of a smoking cessation intervention study.",0,0,

1991,What implementation interventions increase cancer detection rates? a systematic review,"Background Proper screening can reduce mortality and morbidity from colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers. However, effective implementation strategies are warranted if the full benefits of detection are to be realized. As part of a broader agenda to create implementation guidance, we conducted a systematic review to assess interventions designed to increase the detection rate of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC). The interventions considered were: client reminders, client incentives, mass media, small media, group education, individual education, reduction of structural barriers, reduction of out-of-pocket costs, provider evaluation and feedback interventions, and incentives. for the provider. . Our primary outcome, completion of screening, was calculated as the overall median post-intervention absolute percentage point (PP) change in completed screening. Methods Our first step was to conduct an iterative scoping review on the research area. This produced three relevant high-quality systematic reviews. Serving as our evidentiary basis, we conducted a formal update. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCHinfo for randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials, published between 2004 and 2010. Results The update produced 66 new eligible studies with 74 comparisons. The new studies varied considerably in quality. Client reminders, small media, and provider audit and feedback appear to be effective interventions to increase uptake of screening for three types of cancer. Personalized education and reduction of structural barriers also appear effective, but their roles with CRC and cervical screening, respectively, are less well established. Further studies are required to assess client incentives, media, group education, reduction of out-of-pocket costs, and provider incentive interventions. Conclusion New evidence generally aligns with the evidence and conclusions of the original systematic reviews. This review served as the evidence base for an implementation guide. Poor reporting, lack of precision and consistency in defining operational elements, and insufficient consideration of context and differences between populations are areas for further investigation.",0,1,
1992,What is the role of the general practitioner in relation to the family caregiver of a demented family member living in the community? A systematic review of the literature,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the attitudes and perspectives of the family doctor towards the caregivers of family members with dementia and to describe the satisfaction of the caregivers. DESIGN: Systematic review. SUBJECTS: The study population consisted of family members with dementia and their general practitioners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were generic general practitioner tasks and skills to improve home care from the family caregiver's perspective. Caregivers were assessed on satisfaction with the care provided by their general practitioner. RESULTS: The general practitioner is aware of his abilities and limits in all aspects of dementia care and his role vis-à-vis the family caregiver. They also recognized the importance of a proper diagnostic process, but felt uncomfortable disclosing the diagnosis to both the patient and caregiver. They reported being more confident in treatment issues than in diagnostic stages. Caregivers' reports of their GP's attitude in the diagnostic process were rated as helpful to unempathic. General practitioners were found to be highly involved in dementia home care, but carers rated their involvement as insufficient. Caregivers also did not appreciate the general practitioners' lack of appropriate communication skills. The general practitioner considered the lack of time and reward to be a major obstacle in dementia care. CONCLUSION: The key role of general practitioners as care providers and care planners is strengthened by family caregivers' confidence in their abilities. Clear guidelines from early diagnosis to appropriate referrals should improve the general practitioner's ability to support these time- and energy-consuming home care situations. Intervention studies addressing gaps in general practitioners' skills in managing dementia home care could be useful in supporting the family caregiver.",0,0,
1993,"What is the value of routinely using patient-reported outcome measures to improve patient outcomes, care processes, and health service outcomes in cancer care? A systematic review of controlled trials","PURPOSE: The routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) has been advocated as an effective way to standardize cancer practice. However, the question of whether PROMs can lead to real improvements in the quality of patient care remains a matter of debate. This review examined whether the inclusion of PROM in routine clinical practice is associated with improvements in patient outcomes, processes of care, and health service outcomes during active cancer treatment. METHODS: A systematic review of five electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], PsycINFO, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection [PBSC]) was conducted from database inception to May 2012 to locate nonrandomized controlled trials of patients receiving active anticancer therapy or supportive care, regardless of cancer type. RESULTS: Based on prespecified eligibility criteria, we included 26 articles reporting on 24 single controlled trials. Wide variability was evident in the design and use of the interventions performed, the outcomes assessed, and the cancer-specific setting and modality. Health services outcomes were hardly included as endpoints. Overall, the number of statistically significant findings was limited and intervention effect sizes for PROMs were predominantly small to moderate. CONCLUSION: Routine use of PROM increases the frequency of discussion of patient results during consultations. In some studies, PROM is associated with better symptom control, greater measures of supportive care, and patient satisfaction. Additional effort is required to ensure patient adherence, as well as additional support to clinicians who will respond to patient concerns and issues, with clear system guidelines to guide their responses. More research is required to support the cost-benefit ratio of PROM in terms of patient safety, physician burden, and use of health services.",0,0,
1994,What will we teach undergraduate students?,"Opinions of 600 randomly selected physicians on what should be taught to undergraduates in clinical years were analysed. Respondents gave high priority to general medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, emergency medicine, and gynecology, but low priority to forensic medicine, plastic surgery, radiation therapy, anesthesia, radiology, and rehabilitation medicine. Physicians thought these should be taught to postgraduates. The two main groups of physicians, general practitioners and consultants, gave essentially the same priorities. Undergraduate curricula cannot include all major majors, so the results of this analysis can provide a useful basis for selecting the most suitable subjects. Criteria for including other majors may be the ability and enthusiasm of faculty and well thought out and academically sound teaching programs.",0,0,
1995,What's in a Setting?: Influence of Organizational Culture on Provider Adherence to Smoking Treatment Guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Organizational culture is an important but underinvestigated feature of the work environment that can affect provider behavior, including adherence to clinical practice guidelines. There is substantial evidence that medical assistance to smokers can produce significant reductions in tobacco use. However, this evidence has not translated well into practice, as only a small proportion of smokers receive recommended treatment during medical visits. PURPOSE: This study examines organizational culture as a contextual feature of primary care clinics and its impact on adherence to evidence-based guidelines for tobacco use treatment. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional survey data from 500 primary care providers in 60 community clinics located in New York City were collected. Relationships between provider adherence to ""5A"" clinical guidelines, as recommended by the US Public Health Service, and both provider and organization covariates were described. We use hierarchical linear models to examine associations between clinical culture and provider treatment patterns. FINDINGS: Providers in clinics with stronger ""group/clan,"" ""hierarchical,"" and ""rational"" culture types, compared with a ""developmental"" culture, reported greater adherence to 5A guidelines (p < .05 ). System-level structures and care processes were positively associated (p < 0.01), while the number of ongoing quality initiatives was negatively associated with 5A delivery (p < 0.05). Provider familiarity with guidelines (p < 0.01), confidence with cessation counseling (p < 0.05), and perceived efficacy in helping smokers to quit were associated with a 5A intervention more frequent (p < 0.01). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Findings suggest that organizational culture may influence provider adherence to smoking cessation treatment guidelines, even when controlling for other factors known to affect practice patterns. Specifically, cultures that emphasize human resources and performance standards lead to the integration of the 5A guidelines into routine practice. Understanding the role of organizational culture allows managers and healthcare professionals to be strategic in implementing and also maintaining the use of evidence-based guidelines.",0,0,
1996,What's on YOUR Facebook profile? Evaluation of an educational intervention to promote the appropriate use of privacy settings by medical students on social networking sites,"BACKGROUND: The rise of social media has given rise to growing concern about the potential implications of ""unprofessional"" postings by physicians and medical students on individuals, institutions, and the medical profession. Developing and enforcing relevant and effective guidelines has been difficult, and students and clinicians need to consider how their online activities may be perceived in the context of their professional roles. The purpose of this project was to examine the Internet presence of a Canadian medical school graduating class by scanning students' public profiles on the social networking site Facebook, incorporate this information into an educational activity that addresses professionalism and social networks, and evaluate the impact of this activity on the behavior of students. METHODS: A systematic search of the public Facebook profiles of each class member was conducted and data was collected on the types of publicly viewable material. These were presented as part of an educational session on social media and professionalism. A month later, the Facebook search was repeated. RESULTS: Of 152 students in the class, profiles were found for 121 (79.8%). Most students used appropriately restrictive privacy settings"";"" however, a significant minority had publicly viewable information, including comments, photos, location, and status as a medical student. Educational innovation was well received with over 90% of students agreeing that this topic was important and well addressed. A follow-up search found that many students had altered their privacy settings so that less information was publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant proportion of students share potentially unprofessional content on social media. An interactive educational intervention, including targeted disclosure of how participants view others on social media, resulted in a significant change in student behavior.",0,0,
1997,When is it cost-effective to change the behavior of health professionals?,"Because of how health care systems work, new, important, and cost-effective treatments sometimes fail to become routine care, while well-marketed products of equivocal value achieve widespread adoption. Should policymakers try to influence clinical behavior and correct these inefficiencies? The implementation methods achieve a certain level of behavior change, but they cost money to implement. These factors can be combined with the cost effectiveness of treatments to estimate the overall cost effectiveness of the policy. In general, the profitability of policies is always less attractive than the profitability of treatment. Consequently, trying to improve uptake of underused cost-effective care or reduce overuse of new and expensive treatments may not always make economic sense. In this article, we present a method for calculating the cost-effectiveness of policies and illustrate it with examples from a recent trial, conducted during 1997 and 1998, of educational outreach by community pharmacists to influence prescribing in England.",0,0,
1998,When pharmacotherapeutic recommendations can have the opposite effect on the doctor's decision making,"For a long time, the medical literature has shown that patients do not always receive adequate care, including pharmacotherapeutic treatment. To achieve better patient care, a number of physician-oriented interventions are being implemented internationally in an attempt to implement evidence-based medicine in the routine daily practice of physicians. The pharmacy profession has assumed an active role in the implementation of intervention strategies aimed at promoting evidence-based prescription and improving the quality and safety of medication use. However, the medical literature also supports the idea that valid clinical recommendations do not always have the desired impact on medical behavior. We argue that the well-established theory of psychological reactance could explain, at least partially, the cases in which doctors do not act according to such recommendations. Reactance theory suggests that when a certain action is recommended, a motivational state compels us to react in a way that asserts our freedom of choice. Many times we choose to do the opposite of what the recommendation proposes we do or we simply entrench ourselves in our initial position. The basic concepts of psychological reactance are universal and probably applicable to the provision of recommendations to clinicians. Making recommendations about clinical care, including pharmacotherapy, may carry implicit threats, as it may be perceived as an attempt to restrict freedom of choice, potentially generating reactance and efforts to avoid it. By identifying and accounting for factors likely to promote reactance, clinician-oriented interventions might be more effective.",0,0,

2003,Why don't clinicians accept the results of pivotal clinical trials in severe sepsis? A Bayesian analysis,"BACKGROUND: Five pivotal clinical trials (Intensive Insulin Therapy""; Recombinant Human Activated Protein C [rhAPC]; Low Tidal Volume; Low-Dose Steroids; Early Goal-Directed Therapy [EGDT]) demonstrated reduced mortality in patients with sepsis and have been recommended for clinical practice by guidelines. However, adoption of these therapies remains low among clinicians. OBJECTIVES: We selected these five trials and asked: Question 1: What is the current probability that the new therapy is not better than the standard of in my patient with severe sepsis Question 2: What is the current probability of reducing the relative risk of death (RRR) of my patient with severe sepsis at clinically meaningful thresholds (RRR >15%; >20 % >25% METHODS: Bayesian methodologies were applied to this study, considering the odds ratio (OR) for question 1 and using RRR for question 2. previous nes (enthusiastic; 'mild, moderate and severe skeptical) based on various effective sample sizes from other relevant clinical trials (unfavorable evidence). Posterior distributions were calculated by combining the prior distributions and data from pivotal trials (favorable evidence). MAIN FINDINGS: Answer 1: Analysis based on slight prior skepticism shows beneficial results with the Intensive Insulin, rhAPC, and Low-Tidal Volume trials, but not with the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials All trial results become unacceptable by analyzes using moderate or severe skeptical background Answer 2: If we aim for an RRR >15%, the moderate skeptical analysis shows that the current probability of reducing death by this clinical threshold is 88% for intensive insulin, 62 to 65% for the low tidal volume, rhAPC, EGDT trials and 17% for the low dose steroid trial. moderate and severe skeptics do not show a clinically significant reduction in the risk of death for all trials. If our goal is an RRR >20% or >25%, all chances of benefit are reduced regardless of the degree of skepticism. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical threshold analysis offers a new bedside tool to be applied directly to the care of patients with severe sepsis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the evidence (statistical and clinical) is weak for all trials, particularly for the low-dose steroid and EGDT trials. Replication of the results of each of these five clinical trials in confirmatory studies is critical if we are to provide scientifically sound evidence-based patient care.",0,0,
2004,Why do doctors treat their relatives? Exploring the influence of social psychology,"Physicians often receive requests for treatment, medical advice, or other intervention from relatives. Most doctors comply. Reasons for compliance can be classified according to physicians' attitudes toward the family member, colleagues, themselves, ethical guidelines, and the problem. Compliance can also be influenced by elements of social psychology. Social exchange theory, techniques of persuasion, attribution, conformity, desire for approval, and the principle of affinity can induce intervention. Future research should explore clinicians' attitudes toward relatives, the means by which requests are made, treatment outcomes, changes in the relationship after treatment, cultural or family norms, and changes in beliefs or the behavior of physicians that occur when faced with conflicting requests and guidelines. Knowledge of these influences can help clinicians make objective decisions regarding intervention.",0,0,

2007,Why Providers Transfuse Blood Products Outside of Recommended Guidelines Despite Built-In Electronic Best Practice Alerts,"BACKGROUND: Best practice alerts (BPAs) provide clinical decision support (CDS) at the point of care to reduce unnecessary transfusions of blood products, although substantial transfusions continue to fall outside recommended guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To understand why providers request blood transfusions outside of recommended guidelines despite interrupted alerts. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Third level hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Inpatient healthcare providers. INTERVENTION: Provider-BPA interaction data were collected from January 2011 to August 2012 from the hospital's electronic medical record. MEASUREMENTS: Provider responses (free text) to BPA indications for blood transfusion were independently reviewed and categorized by 2 licensed clinicians, and agreement was assessed by chi(2) analysis and kappa score. RESULTS: The justification for canceling BPA for blood transfusion was very diverse, with acute bleeding being the most common (> 34%), followed by protocolized behaviors in specialized services (up to 26%), up to ""symptomatic"" anemia (11%). -12%). Many providers transfused in anticipation of a surgical or procedural intervention (10%-15%) or imminent hospital discharge (2%-5%). Resident physicians represented the majority (55%) of providers interacting with BPAs. CONCLUSION: Providers who interact with BPAs (mainly residents and mid-tier providers) often do not have the bargaining power to change ordering behavior. Protocolized behaviors, which are unlikely to be influenced by BPAs, are among the most cited reasons for transfusing outside the guidelines. Symptomatic anemia is a common, albeit subjective, indication cited for blood transfusion. With a wide range of individually uncommon rationales for transfusion behavior, secondary use of electronic medical record databases and integrated CDS tools are important to efficiently analyze common practice behaviors.",0,0,
2008,Why we still perform arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis: a multi-method study,"BACKGROUND: Historically, knee arthroscopy has been a common treatment for knee osteoarthritis. However, multiple randomized controlled trials in conjunction with a Cochrane review have led NICE to recommend that arthroscopy not be used in the vast majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis. These recommendations have been replicated internationally. The use of arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee has decreased"";"" however, it is still prevalent. This study examines factors perceived to influence decision making using a theoretical framework that was developed for behavior change research (Theoretical Domains Framework). This study will allow future work to develop and evaluate an intervention specifically targeting the identified barriers. METHODS: A multimodal approach involving questionnaire research and semi-structured interviews was used with all grades of clinicians providing a knee arthroscopy service at a Level One Trauma Center in the West Midlands, UK. Focus groups with patients were also conducted. Mixed methods analysis was used, with descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic content analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 26 surgeons responded to the questionnaires, carrying out 6 semi-structured interviews. All surgical grades were represented. Two focus groups of six patients were conducted. The results identified 13 beliefs in 12 domains (some beliefs were represented in all domains). Beliefs that there was pressure from patients to do something, that there were limited other options available, that surgeons wanted to meet patients' expectations, and that there was time pressure in the clinic seemed to be the predominant barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, this paper has described the relevant barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the NICE guideline regarding the use of arthroscopy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The next step in this process is the development of a targeted intervention, and we discuss the barriers that are most likely to disrupt practice if targeted through an intervention, and what such an intervention might look like. Such intervention would require evaluation within the clinical setting.",0,0,

Risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes include recognized genetic disease in the family or the individual, prior congenital disease, miscarriage, prematurity, fetal growth restriction, infertility, chronic maternal disease, lifestyle, and environmental or occupational factors. Effective preconception care involves a variety of preventive, therapeutic, and behavioral interventions. Although there are national preconception care recommendations for the general population in Italy, they are generally promoted informally and only for single risk factors. There is currently a growing interest in offering a global intervention in this field. The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes and behaviors of Italian women of childbearing age and health professionals regarding preconception health. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among women of childbearing age and health professionals between February 2014 and February 2015. Five focus groups were conducted: 2 with non-pregnant women aged 22 to 44 years and 3 with health professionals. Discussion topics included women's questions about preconception health, concerns and barriers regarding preconception care interventions, attitudes and behaviors of women and health professionals towards preconception health. conception, sources of information for women. In the analysis of the focus groups, what was said by the women was prioritized, complemented with information from the focus groups of health professionals. RESULTS: Fourteen women of childbearing age (8 nulliparous and 6 multiparous) and 12 health professionals (3 nurses, 4 midwives, 5 physicians) participated in the focus groups. The results indicate the presence of many barriers and a lack of awareness of preconception health in relation to women, health professionals and policies. Women's knowledge and attitudes toward preconception primary care information are described. The main source of reference information in this field for Italian women seems to be their obstetrician-gynaecologist. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that several barriers influence preconception care in Italy. In addition, a lack of awareness about preconception health and care emerges among Italian women of childbearing age and health professionals. The findings could contribute to strategies for the implementation of preconception care guidelines.",0,0,
2010,WIC Provider Perspectives on Offering Smoking Cessation Interventions,"PURPOSE: To examine WIC clinic providers' perspectives on the offering of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four focus groups comprised of WIC nurses, dieticians, and social workers (N = 25) were conducted at WIC clinics in eastern Iowa. Researchers developed discussion guidelines to determine how WIC providers were currently approaching pregnant women who smoke cigarettes and what barriers they considered to providing effective smoking cessation interventions. Code mapping was used to analyze the focus group discussions. RESULTS: Factors that influenced the ability of WIC staff to provide a smoking cessation intervention to pregnant women included available time, clinic priorities, staff approaches to clients, and staff training. In addition, providers expressed concerns about educational materials for clients, as well as other client issues that prevented smoking cessation. The absence of mechanisms to track clinical outcomes related to smoking cessation was also noted. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: WIC providers have time constraints that may require minimal or low-intensity smoking cessation interventions, but were not aware that such approaches are truly effective. WIC providers require more education on the whole topic of smoking cessation in order to be more proactive in their attempts to help pregnant women quit. Training that improves self-efficacy and understanding of the impact of smoking on mothers, infants, and children should be initiated to motivate staff to intervene. Another strategy to motivate WIC staff in this regard could be to follow up on clinic results to help women quit or prevent relapse.",0,0,
2011,Will mothers of sick children help their husbands quit smoking after receiving a brief intervention from nurses? Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard to children. Clinical guidelines suggest that nurses advise smoking parents to stop smoking when accompanying their sick children to pediatric settings, but the guidelines did not mention what nurses can do if parents are not with their children. This study examines the effectiveness of a nurse-led, low-intensity health education initiative for nonsmoking mothers in motivating them to take action to help their husbands quit smoking. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial and 1483 non-smoking women, living with smoking husbands, were recruited when accompanying their sick children on hospital admission in general pediatric wards/outpatient departments of four hospitals in Hong Kong. The women were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The first received a brief health education advice from the nurses, a specially designed health education booklet, a ""no smoking"" sticker, and a telephone reminder a week later"";"" the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was women's action in helping their smoking husbands quit smoking at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: A higher proportion of women in the intervention than in the control group had taken steps to help their husbands quit smoking. husbands quit smoking at 3 months (76% vs. 65%, p < 0.001), at 6 months (66% vs. 49%, p < 0.001), and at 12 months (52% vs. 40%, P < 0.001) Women who had received the intervention had a better knowledge of the health risks of smoking, a greater intention to take action, perceived their husbands' willingness to quit/reduce smoking, had previously advised their husbands that they quit smoking. had quit smoking, knew their husbands' smoking history, and knew that their husbands had tried to quit before and intended to help them quit at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A brief health education intervention delivered by nurses in pediatric settings can be effective in motivating mothers of sick children to take steps to help their husbands quit smoking. recommend adding the following to clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of tobacco dependence and dependence: 'Nurses should offer all non-smoking mothers of a sick child brief advice to encourage their husbands to quit smoking'.

2012,Words matter: increasing implementation of clinical guidelines.,"Objectives: To determine whether writing guideline recommendations in behavior-specific 'plain English' language increases the likelihood that service users (patients) will implement them. Design: Randomized controlled trial in which participants received either the original text of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) public guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia or a behaviorally specified text with the same content. Setting: Networks of mental health service users and voluntary sector organizations within two inner London boroughs. Participants: Eighty-four mental health service users recruited by mail or face-to-face contact at service user meetings. Intervention: The section of the NICE public guidelines for schizophrenia relating to psychological and pharmacological treatments was rewritten to improve behavioral style and specificity by applying evidence-based and psychologically informed principles of good written communication. Outcome measures: Cognitive predictors of behaviour, as specified by evidence-based theory of planned behaviour, constituted the primary outcome as it was not possible to measure actual behavior from guideline implementation. Predictors were behavioral intentions to implement the guidelines, attitudes toward implementation, and perceived behavioral control over implementation. Satisfaction with the guidelines and perceived understanding were also measured. Results: Specified ""plain language"" cues in behavior led to stronger intentions to implement the cues, more positive attitudes toward them, and greater perceived behavioral control over their use. There was no difference in perceived satisfaction or understanding. Conclusions: Writing guidelines with high behavioral specificity along with the use of ""plain language"" can be a simple and effective method to increase their implementation. An assessment with a behavioral outcome is now needed.",0,1,
2013,Working to improve hospital hyperglycemia care through statewide collaboration: the Georgia Hospital Association Diabetes Special Interest Group,"OBJECTIVE: To review the efforts of the Georgia Hospital Association Diabetes Special Interest Group (DSIG) to develop and disseminate sample clinical guidelines on the management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Beginning in February 2003, a consortium of physicians and allied health professionals from across the state of Georgia began meeting frequently to develop a plan to improve care for hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia. The immediate goals of the DSIG were the identification and organization of stakeholders, the development of consensus sample clinical guidelines, and the dissemination of information. RESULTS: Since its inception, DSIG has accomplished the following: development of 7 consensus sample clinical guidelines, construction of a website that publishes these clinical guidelines and other useful related information and educational materials, and sponsorship of workshops statewide. Georgia. CONCLUSION: As the importance of glucose monitoring in the hospital setting is increasingly recognized, institutions must find ways to apply the results of clinical trials to ""real world"" hospital settings. The DSIG is an example of a successful collaboration that could serve as a model for other state hospital organizations that wish to develop programs to improve care for hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia.",0,0,

2017,Yoga for chronic low back pain: a randomized trial.,"Background: Previous studies indicate that yoga may be an effective treatment for chronic or recurrent low back pain. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of yoga and usual care for chronic or recurrent low back pain. Design: Parallel-group randomized controlled trial using computer-generated randomization conducted between April 2007 and March 2010. Results were assessed using a postal questionnaire. (International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Registration Number: ISRCTN 81079604) Setting: 13 non-UK NHS facilities. Patients: 313 adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain. Intervention: Yoga (n = 156) or usual care (n = 157). All participants received an educational brochure on back pain. The intervention group was offered a 12-class graded-progress yoga program taught by 12 teachers for 3 months. Measurements: Roland'CMorris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores at 3 (primary outcomes), 6, and 12 (secondary outcomes) months""; pain, pain self-efficacy, and general health measures at 3, 6, and 12 months (secondary outcomes). Results: 93 (60%) patients offered yoga attended at least 3 of the first 6 sessions and at least 3 other sessions. The yoga group had better back function at 3, 6, and 12 months than usual care Adjusted mean RMDQ score was 2.17 points (95% CI, 1.03 to 3.31 points) lower in the yoga group at 3 months, 1 .48 points (CI, 0.33 to 2.62 points) lower at 6 months and 1.57 points (CI, 0.42 to 2.71 points) lower at 12 months.The yoga and mindfulness groups group had similar back pain and general health scores at 3, 6, and 12 months, and the yoga group had higher pain self-efficacy scores at 3 and 6 months, but not at 12 months. of 157 usual care participants and 12 of 156 yoga participants reported adverse events, mostly increased pain. Information: Data were missing for the primary outcome (yoga group, n = 21; usual care group, n = 18) and differential data (more in the yoga group) were missing for secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Offering a 12-week yoga program to adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain produced greater improvements in back function than usual care.",0,0,
2018,Young people receiving orthodontic care are not immune to poor diet and being overweight: A call for dental providers to participate in prevention efforts,"OBJECTIVES: Although obesity is common in the US, disparities exist. Orthodontic samples are assumed to be wealthier than the general population and not in need of assistance in developing or maintaining healthy lifestyles. This document assesses the need for intervention in the orthodontic population by examining the diet and weight status of a sample of orthodontic patients and describes the role of dentists in obesity prevention efforts. METHODS: 552 patients ages 8 to 14 years, 54% female, 51% non-Hispanic white, 26% Hispanic, were recruited from orthodontic practices in Southern California to participate in a randomized controlled trial of health promotion provided by a doctor. Height, weight, demographics, and diet were recorded. Chi-square analyzes were used to test for baseline differences by gender, age, ethnicity, and income. RESULTS: 13% of the sample were overweight and 9% obese. Men had a higher rate of obesity than women. Lower-income youth had a higher rate than higher-income youth. Hispanic youth had a higher rate than non-Hispanic white youth. Non-compliance with national dietary guidelines was common, differing significantly by demographic group. CONCLUSIONS: Within a sample not normally considered to be in need of assistance, nearly 25% were overweight or obese, and the majority did not meet dietary recommendations. While most patients could benefit from the intervention, male, Hispanic, and low-income groups were in greater need of assistance. Dental providers, who frequently see young people and already discuss nutrition in the context of oral health, have an opportunity to contribute to obesity prevention.",0,0,
2019,Systematic Review of the Scope of the Choice Architecture Movement: Toward Understanding When and Why Nudges Work,"In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the nudge movement domain by reviewing 422 choice architecture interventions in 156 empirical studies. We report the distribution of studies across countries, years, domains, applicability subdomains, intervention types, and moderators associated with each intervention category to review the current state of the nudge movement. In addition, we highlight certain characteristics of experimental and reporting studies and practices that can make it difficult to accumulate evidence in the field. Specifically, we found that 74% of studies were primarily motivated to assess the effectiveness of interventions in a specific setting, while only 24% of studies focused on exploring moderators or underlying processes. We also noted that only 7% of studies applied power analyses, 2% used guidelines to improve reporting quality, no studies in our database were pre-registered, and the intervention nomenclatures used were not exhaustive, and They often had overlapping categories. Based on our current observations and proposed solutions from other fields, we provide directly applicable recommendations for future research to support the accumulation of evidence on why and when nudges work.",0,1,
