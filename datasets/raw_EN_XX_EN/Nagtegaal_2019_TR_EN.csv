1,"A prospective, controlled trial of a pharmacy-driven alerting system to increase thromboprophylaxis rates in inpatients.","Although venous thromboembolism is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the hospital, a significant portion of patients at risk do not take precautions known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether a pharmacy-guided alerting system would be associated with a higher rate of adequate venous thromboembolism prevention measures compared to usual care among at-risk patients admitted to the general internal medicine ward. The study was a prospective, controlled trial set in a university-based teaching hospital. Participants were adults admitted to the general internal medicine inpatient ward between 19 June and 21 September 2006 (Monday to Friday). Their treatment included pharmacist assessment of the risk of venous thromboembolism and a pharmacist-directed warning to the treating physician. The proportion of at-risk patients who received adequate thromboprophylaxis within 36 hours of admission was recorded. In total, 140 patients were at sufficient risk for venous thromboembolism to be included. In the usual care group, prophylactic measures were requested for 49 (61%) of 80 patients at moderate to high risk. In the pharmacist alert group, 44 (73%) of 60 patients at moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism received adequate thromboprophylaxis (P = 0.15). Although we did not observe a statistically significant difference between groups, our results are in line with previous reports suggesting that warning systems may increase the proportion of hospitalized patients who take adequate precautions to prevent venous thromboembolism.",0,1,
2,The effect of clinical pharmacy service on lipid control in patients with peripheral arterial disease.,"Objective Our group and others have previously identified that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are significantly undertreated in terms of overall cardiovascular risk factor management, despite national guidelines to the contrary. To maximize risk factor control in our patients with PAH, we created a pharmacist-led, physician-monitored algorithmic approach to the outpatient management of lipids in patients with PAH. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of this service on lipid screening and control in patients with PAH. Methods We analyzed records of patients treated in a large, group-model, nonprofit regionally managed care system serving approximately 405,000 members. The electronic medical record provided complete examination, laboratory and pharmacy data for all patients. Pharmacy data were analyzed to identify prescriptions for lipid-lowering agents. Lipid control was assessed with fasting lipid data. Patients with confirmed PAH and no clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) were served and followed for at least 6 months between May 2003 and September 2004. Results We identified 5159 active patients with an administrative diagnosis of PAH. Of these, 1075 can be confirmed by a non-invasive arterial study. Exclusion of 384 patients with a diagnosis of CAD resulted in a cohort of 691 patients. Of these, 90 patients were admitted to the lipid service (study group), and 601 received standard care. The mean follow-up was 17.1 months. Screening fasting lipid profiles were found in 95.6% (86/90) of patients in the study group and only 66.9% (402/601) of standard-care patients (P < .0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control was improved in the pharmacist-administered group, with 79.1% (68/86) LDL-C below 100 mg/dL compared to the standard care group (54.8%) [219/400]"" ;"" P < .0001). An LDL-C value of greater than 130 mg/dL was recorded in the treatment and control groups at 1.2% and 14.0% (56/400), respectively (P < .001). Statin use was present in 51.9% (312/601) of the control group patients and 84.4% (76/90) of the pharmacist-administered group (P < .001). Conclusions Despite the national consensus for PAH as a CAD equivalent, patients are currently under-treated for atherosclerotic risk factor modification. Launching a pharmacist-led, physician-monitored lipid service better aligns with national guidelines",0,1,
3,Using peer feedback to improve hand washing and glove use among Thai healthcare workers.,"Background: Without preventive practices such as Universal Precautions, healthcare workers are at significant risk for blood-borne infection, especially in areas with a high prevalence of HIV infection, such as Thailand. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer feedback program (PFP) on handwashing and wearing gloves (HW/GW) among Thai healthcare workers. Methods: Subjects (N = 91) were randomly assigned to receive PFP versus no treatment. Peer observers rated their colleagues' HW/GW compatibility during patient care using a checklist. For 1 month, the researcher published a report on the adaptive behaviors obtained from every 3-day observation. HW/GW was also assessed by the investigator by direct observation 1 month before, during the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. Results: Baseline HW/GW ratios for the PFP and control groups were 49.2% and 61.5%, respectively. The PFP group had a significantly higher adjusted compliance rate than the control group during the intervention period (P =.0001). However, there was no significant difference in the compliance scores obtained 1 month after the intervention. Results: PFP was effective during the intervention period, but the effect was not persistent. Therefore, additional methods should be sought to promote preservation of the effect.

6,"""First, do no harm"": legal guidelines for health programs affecting 10-17 year olds who sell sex or inject drugs","INTRODUCTION: There is a strong evidence base that the stigma, discrimination and delinquency affecting key adolescent populations (KPs) aged 10-17 is intensified due to national and international legal structures based on law enforcement-based interventions related to detention. Mandatory “rehabilitation” in pending detention, incarceration and institutional placement. While there are evidence- and rights-based technical guidelines for interventions among older groups, these guidelines have yet to be adopted by international public health actors for fear that international law imposes different standards on adolescents aged 10-17 who engage in behavior such as selling sex. or injecting drugs. DISCUSSION: As required by international human rights, health, juvenile justice and child protection law, interventions among adolescent KPs aged 10-17 should not involve any arrest, prosecution or detention. It is imperative that interventions do not rely on law enforcement, but instead utilize low-threshold, voluntary services, shelter and support, and peer-based outreach whenever possible. These services must be mobile and accessible and allow alternatives to parental leave to provide life-saving support, including HIV testing, treatment and care, needle and syringe programs, opioid substitution treatment, safe abortions, antiretroviral therapy and gender-affirming care. and hormone therapy for transgender adolescents. To enable enrollment in the Services, international guidance states that informed consent and confidentiality must be provided, including waiving parental consent requirements. To remove deterrents to health practitioners and researchers from engaging with adolescent KPs aged 10-17, it is recommended that government agencies and ethics review boards exempt or waive mandatory reporting. If authorities try to unintentionally place adolescent KPs in institutions in violation of international law and guidelines, they have the right to take legal action. Legal guidelines also ensure that these adolescents have a say over their placement, have access to legal counsel to challenge conditions of detention and regular visits from peers, friends and family, and that all facilities are subject to frequent and periodic review by independent organizations, including: Community-based groups led by KPs. CONCLUSIONS: Auditing international law states that protective interventions among KPs aged 10-17 not only must include low-threshold, voluntary services, but must also ""protect"" adolescent KPs from harm caused by law enforcement interventions. Going forward, health practitioners should adjust programs to the principles of minimum intervention, due process and proportionality, respecting the right to health and appropriately limiting participation in juvenile justice and child protection, if any, as a last resort.",0,0,
7,"""How much will you get paid if I volunteer?"" Suggested institutional policy on award, consent, and research","Pharmaceutical companies often ask GPs to conduct phase IV or postmarketing research on new drugs. Companies pay doctors to enroll their patients and report dosage and side-effect information. Postmarketing research involves billions of dollars in promotion and familiarization, but subjects' informed consent to it does not normally include physician reward. Improving investigators' finances while increasing the medical risks to Phase IV subjects is ethically wrong, especially if the subjects are unaware of the investigator's rewards. We propose a model policy and guideline that validates subjects' need for informed consent, researchers' need for recognition and support, and institutions' need to protect patients from undisclosed risks and relationships.",0,0,

We used a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to help explain the findings of an academic elaboration intervention trial in the inpatient units of four Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. We surveyed 164 nurses and conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sample of 33 nurses with different attitudes towards graduation counseling. Content analysis was used to inductively characterize the issues raised by the participants. The resulting themes were categorized using the knowledge-attitude-behavior framework of adherence to the guideline. Informational and attitudinal barriers included perceived lack of skill in quit counseling and skepticism about the effectiveness of quit guidelines in hospitalized veterans. Nurses also reported multiple behavioral and organizational barriers to compliance with the guideline: resistance from patients, insufficient time and resources, presence of smoking areas in VA facilities, and lack of coordination with primary care. VA hospitals should train inpatient staff on how to negotiate behavior change, integrate quit counseling into nurses' workflow, develop alternative referral mechanisms for post-discharge dropout counseling, and adopt hospital policies to promote inpatient withdrawal.",0,0,

11,(S)Partners for Heart Health: A school-based program to improve physical activity and nutrition to improve cardiovascular health in grade 5 students,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association Position Statement on the Promotion of Cardiovascular Health in Public Schools encourages school-based interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in children through prevention or reduction of risk factors, with an emphasis on creating an environment that promotes healthy food choices. and physical activity (PA). To address issues related to CVD risk factors, including obesity, in Michigan children, a multidisciplinary team of Michigan State University (MSU) faculty, clinicians, and healthcare students was formed as a ""(S)partner"" with elementary school physics education. Education (PE) teachers and MSU Extension staff to develop and implement an affordable, sustainable program for CVD risk factor prevention and management for 5th grade students. This (S) partnership aims to strengthen and improve the existing 5th grade PE, health and nutrition curriculum by achieving the following objectives: 1) to improve students' knowledge, attitudes, and confidence in nutrition, FA, and heart health""; 2) to increase PA and nutrition number of students reaching national recommendations; and 3) increasing the number of students with desired CVD risk factor status based on national pediatric guidelines. Secondary purposes include promoting school staff and parental support for heart health to help children achieve their goals and provide experiential learning and service to MSU healthcare professionals for academic credit. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot effectiveness study was approved by the MSU IRB. At the beginning and end of the academic year, students undergo a CVD risk factor assessment conducted by MSU medical students and graduate students. Key intervention components include eight lesson plans (performed bimonthly) designed to promote heart-healthy eating and PA behaviors, conducted by Physical Education teachers with the assistance of MSU undergraduate dietetics and kinesiology students (Spartners). In the last 10 minutes of each class, MSU Spartners organizes small breakout/discussion groups with 5th graders. Additionally, each Spartner case manages/mentors two to three 5th graders using a web-based goal setting and tracking protocol throughout the school year. DISCUSSION: This article explains the rationale, development, and methods of the Spartners for Heart Health program. This is a multi-level intervention designed to promote heart health behaviors and prevent or manage CVD risk factors in children. We believe this will be a viable, sustainable intervention that can be disseminated and adopted by other institutions at minimal cost, by involving university students as an integral part of measurement and response teams.",0,0,

13,15 Red Herrings and 100 Apples Split: A Careful Story from the Mid-19th Century on Comparing Hospital Mortality Rates,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially when compared to provincial facilities. He backed up this claim with statistics published in William Fair's General Registrar's report, which claimed that the death rates of 24 London hospitals exceeded 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died during the year by the number of inpatients in a single day. Calculated by dividing the annual number of deaths by the total number of inpatients during the year, the death rate for London hospitals was 10%. A heated debate erupted in the London medical press about how best to calculate hospital mortality rates. Critics argued that Farr did not adjust to the differences in disease severity between urban and rural hospitals, and that his figures would mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale criticized the poor quality of hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics aimed at comparing provider quality.",0,0,

15,2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: A paradigm shift in managing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,"The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from previous cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from the most comprehensive meta-analyses as well as individual randomized trials and present several major paradigm shifts, including: targeting to reduce the risk of ASCVD rather than targeting LDL-C levels, advocating the use of evidence - based on statin doses and statin as first-line therapy Use of a new risk calculator and risk cut-off point to guide initiation of therapy. These major changes have caused controversy and confusion in the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace this change.

16,2015 AAHA/AAFP pain management guidelines for dogs and cats,"RATIONALE: Strong advances in pain management for pets underpinned the decision of the American Association of Animal Hospitals (AAHA) and the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) to expand the information provided in the 2007 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines. The 2015 Guidelines summarize much of this new information and provide a distinctive review. RELATED: Pain management is at the core of veterinary practice, alleviating pain, improving patient outcomes, and increasing both quality of life and the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. These Guidelines support veterinarians in putting pain management into practice and improving patient care. APPROACHES: Management of pain requires ongoing care that includes anticipation, early intervention, and assessment of response on an individual patient basis. A team-oriented approach, including the owner, is essential to maximize the recognition, prevention and treatment of pain in animals. EVIDENCE BASE: Guidelines include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for managing pain"", which are as evidence-based as possible and otherwise represent an expert opinion. Behavioral changes are currently the main indicator of pain and the healing process or course of progression and recently confirmed pain Postoperative pain is largely predictable, but there is a strong body of evidence to support strategies to alleviate maladaptive and maladaptive forms. Chronic pain is dominated by degenerative joint disease (DJD). It is one of the most important and underdiagnosed diseases of cats and dogs. DJD It is ubiquitous, found in pets of all ages, and inevitably progresses over time; evidence-based strategies for management are established in dogs and emerging in cats.",0,0,
17,5As Team obesity intervention in primary care: development and evaluation of collaborative decision-making weight management tools,"Despite several clinical practice guidelines, a significant gap remains in the prevention and management of obesity in primary care. To address the need to change provider behavior, a randomized controlled trial with convergent mixed methods evaluation was conducted, the 5As Team (5AsT) study. The 5AsT toolkit was developed as part of the 5AsT response. This article describes the development process and evaluation of these tools. The tools were jointly developed by the multidisciplinary research team and 5AST, which included registered nurses/nurse practitioners (n = 15), mental health professionals (n = 7) and registered dietitians (n = 7). The 5AsT intervention group is in a primary care network in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 5AsT tool development occurred through a need-based, iterative process of practice/practice during learning collaborative sessions of the 5AsT intervention. During tool development, feedback was received through field notes, and final vendor evaluation was done through anonymous surveys. Twelve tools were developed with 5AsT. All tools were rated 'most useful' or 'moderately useful' in primary care practice by 5AsT. Four key findings during 5AsT tool development were the need for: adaptive tools, tools to facilitate interdisciplinary practice, tools to help patients understand realistic expectations for weight loss, and collaborative decision-making tools for goal setting and relapse prevention. The 5AsT tools are essential tools of care that extend the usefulness of the 5A of the obesity management framework in clinical practice.",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SET Six Australian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to 24 acute services during the trial period. INTERVENTIONS Participating wards were randomly assigned to receive the nurse-led 6-PACK program or usual care for 12 months. The 6-PACK program included a fall risk tool and personalized use of one or more of six interventions: 'fall alert' sign, surveillance of patients in the bathroom, ensuring patients' walking aids are accessible, toilet regimen, low-low bed and bed/chair alarm use of. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Co-primary outcomes were falls and fall injuries per 1000 bed days. RESULTS During the trial, 46,245 referrals were made to 16 medical and eight surgical services. This represented 31 411 individual patients, as many were admitted more than once. Patients' characteristics and length of stay were similar in intervention and control services. The use of 6-PACK program components was higher in intervention services than in control services (incidence rate 3.05, 95% confidence interval 2.14 to 4.34""; P<0.001). A total of 1831 falls and 613 fall injuries occurred, with falling rates (incidence ratio 1.04, P<0.001). 0.78 to 1.37; P=0.796) and fall injuries (0.96, 0.72 to 1.27; ""P=0.766) were similar in intervention and control services. RESULTS Following the introduction of the 6-PACK program, positive changes have occurred in fall prevention practice. However, there was no difference in fall and fall injuries between the groups.

20,Behavioral-Economic Perspective on Poverty,"Standard theories about poverty fall into two camps. Social scientists view the behavior of the economically disadvantaged as either calculated adaptations to prevailing conditions or as the result of a unique ""culture of poverty"" filled with perverse values. The first camp assumes that people are highly rational, have consistent and justified beliefs, and achieve their goals effectively, without error, and without needing help. The second camp attributes to the poor a variety of psychological and attitudinal shortcomings that often mislead their views and make their choices fallible and require paternalistic guidance. We propose a third opinion. We argue that the behavior patterns of the poor can be neither perfectly calculating nor particularly perverse. Rather, in narrow margins of poverty, the poor may exhibit the same basic weaknesses and prejudices as people from other walks of life, except that the same behaviors often manifest in more pronounced ways and lead to worse outcomes. Below we show the kinds of insights that can be gained from a more behaviorally realistic analysis of the economic conditions of the poor and propose alternative policies.",0,0,

This case report details the challenges of large-scale QI assessment and proposes solutions based on adaptive study design. Study design We used a two-row assessment method to examine a QI effort to improve delivery of HIV preventive care in public health facilities in three regions in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, over a 3-year period. We initially used a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Key findings During the RCT study period, tensions arose between intervention delivery and assessment design due to the loss of randomization unit integrity over time, pressure to implement changes across randomization unit boundaries, and the use of administrative rather than functional structures for randomization. In response to this loss of design integrity, we moved to a more flexible intervention design and mixed method quasi-experimental evaluation based on both a qualitative analysis and a discontinuous time-series quantitative analysis. Conclusions Cluster RCT designs may not be optimal for evaluating complex interventions to improve implementation in uncontrolled ""real world"" environments. More flexible, context-sensitive assessment designs provide the data needed to evaluate efficacy, while offering a better balance between the need to adjust intervention during assessment to meet implementation challenges. Our case study involved HIV care in a resource-limited setting, but these issues likely apply to complex remedial interventions in other settings.",0,0,
25,central cardiovascular risk service to improve compliance with the guideline in private primary care offices,"BACKGROUND: Many major healthcare systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians with the management of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV risk service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists would improve compliance with the guideline in primary care offices in rural and small communities. METHODS: This is a randomized prospective study clustered in 12 primary care offices. Medical offices were randomized to either CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention will last 12 months and all subjects will have research visits at baseline and at 12 months. Primary outcomes will include compliance with treatment guidelines and control of key CV risk factors. Data will also be abstracted from medical records at 30 months to determine whether the effect of the intervention persists after it has been stopped. RESULTS: Subjects in this study will be enrolled until 2015 and results will be announced in 2018. This study will provide information on whether a remote, centralized CV risk service can improve compliance with the guideline in medical offices that do not have the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.",0,1,
26,clinical decision support system for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: impact on physician behavior.,"CONTEXT: Computer-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been promoted because of their potential to improve the quality of healthcare. However, given the limited range of clinical settings in which they are tested, such systems must be rigorously evaluated before they can be widely applied to clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the submission of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis guidelines using CDSS increases the proportion of appropriate clinical practice decisions. DESIGN: Time series study conducted between December 1997 and July 1999. LOCATION: Orthopedic surgery department of a teaching hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1971 patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. INTERVENTION: A CDSS designed to provide immediate information on the prevention of venous thromboembolism among surgical patients was integrated into daily medical practice over three 10-week intervention periods, alternating with four 10-week control periods with a 4-week washout between each period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of eligible prescriptions ordered for anticoagulation according to predetermined clinical guidelines during the intervention and control periods. RESULTS: Physicians performed 82.8% of cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.6%-87.1%) during the control periods and 94.9% (95% CI, 92.5%-%) of the cases during the intervention periods. 96.6) complied with the guidelines. Prescription compliance increased significantly during each intervention period (P<.001). Each time CDSS was removed, physician practice reverted to what was observed before intervention was initiated. The relative risk of inappropriate implementation decisions during intervention versus control periods was 3.8 (95% CI, 2.7–5.4). CONCLUSION: In our study, the implementation of clinical guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis through a CDSS, which is routinely used in an orthopedic surgery department and integrated into the hospital information system, changed physician behaviors and improved compliance with guidelines.

During the 18-month study period, the computer generated 303 alerts in the intervention group and 388 in the control group. The median response time of clinicians to these stimuli was 11 days in the intervention group and 52 days in the control group (PJJ0.0001, log-rank test). During the study, the computer generated 432 primary care reminders for the intervention group and 360 reminders for the control group. The median response time of clinicians to these alerts was 114 days in the intervention group and more than 500 days in the control group (PJJ0.0001, log-rank test). Of 191 patients in the intervention group, 67 (35%) had one or more hospitalizations, compared with 70 (44%) of 158 patients in the control group (stratified Wilcoxon test for initial CD4 count). There was no difference in survival between the intervention and control groups (P = 0.18, log-rank test).

28,clinically integrated postgraduate education program in evidence-based medicine and a 'no intervention' program to improve disability assessments: a cluster of randomized clinical trials,"BACKGROUND: Although various studies have shown that teaching KBT is effective in improving knowledge, there is currently no convincing evidence that teaching KBT also changes professional behavior in practice. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinically integrated postgraduate education program in CPA on evidence-based disability assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: In one set of randomized controlled trials, fifty-four case-based learning groups consisting of 132 physicians and 1680 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received a clinically integrated, postgraduate, 5-day evidence-based medical education program consisting of (home) assignments, peer teaching, interactive training in databases, lectures, and brainstorming sessions. No training was given to the control group. The primary outcome was evidence-based disability assessment, as indicated by the frequency of use of evidence of adequate quality in disability assessment reports. General CPA behavioral outcome measures are not available. Therefore, we followed the general guidelines for establishing performance indicators and set a preliminary limit for determining adequate quality as recommended for evaluating PE training. Doctors trained in CPA performed more evidence-based assessments of disability than physicians in the control group (difference in absolute ratio 9.7%, 95% CI 3.5 to 15.9). Primary outcome differences between groups remained significant after both cluster-adjusted analysis and additional sensitivity analyzes that accounted for subjects lost to follow-up. RESULTS: A CPA program has successfully enhanced the use of evidence in a non-hospital-based medical specialty. Our findings support general recommendations for using multiple training methods to change physician behavior. In addition, the professional context of the intervention was found to be very supportive, as searching databases, using and applying guidelines, and other forms of evidence were accepted as standard practice and encouraged by colleagues and management.",0,0,
29,clinic-based mammography intervention targeting inner-city women.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a clinic-based intervention program on mammography use of urban women. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted using the firm systems methodology.

PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50 to 74 years who had at least one routine clinical appointment (when it was time for a mammogram) during the study period were enrolled (n = 314). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention program emphasized nursing involvement and included physician education, provider referrals, use of audio-visual and printed patient education materials, transportation assistance in the form of bus cards, pre-appointment phone or postcard reminders, and rescheduling assistance. Control firm women received usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Completion of mammography within 8 weeks of clinical visits was significantly higher among intervention (49%) than in control (22%) tough women (p < .001). These effects persisted after adjusting for possible confusion based on age, race, health insurance coverage, and prior hospital experience with mammography (odds ratio 3.5: 95% confidence interval 1.9. 6.5). The intervention effect was modified based on the type of insurance coverage and previous mammography history. Process evaluation showed that bus transits and rescheduling efforts did not contribute to the observed increases in screening participation. CONCLUSIONS: A clinic-based program that includes physician education, provider referrals, patient education materials, and appointment reminders and that emphasizes nursing involvement could facilitate compliance with breast cancer screening guidelines among urban women.",0,1,
30,cluster randomized controlled trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a 'whole systems' self-management support model for the management of long-term conditions in primary care: trial protocol,"Background Patients with long-term conditions are increasingly becoming the focus of quality improvement activities in healthcare to reduce their impact on quality of life and reduce the burden on care use. There is significant interest in the potential of self-management support to improve health and reduce use in these patient populations, but there is little consensus on the optimal model that will best provide this support. We describe the implementation and evaluation of self-management support through an evidence-based 'whole systems' model that includes patient support, training for primary care teams, and service realignment, all integrated into routine primary care. Methods The evaluation includes a large-scale, multi-site study of the implementation, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of this model of self-administration support using a cluster of randomized controlled trials in patients with three long-term diabetes, chronic obstructive disease. lung disease (COPD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Outcome measures include health care utilization and quality of life. We describe the methods of the cluster randomized trial. Discussion If the 'whole systems' model proves to be effective and cost-effective, it will provide decision makers with a model for providing self-management support for populations with long-term conditions that can be broadly applied to maximize 'access' in all areas. larger patient population.",0,0,
31,cluster randomized clinical trial to improve prescribing patterns in outpatient pediatrics.,"Objectives After previously demonstrating that an electronic prescriber and decision support system improve pediatric prescribing behavior for otitis media in an academic clinical setting, we evaluated whether point-of-care presentation of the evidence could demonstrate similar effects for a wide variety of other common pediatric conditions. . Design Cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting An education clinic/clinical practice area and a primary care pediatric clinic serving a mix of rural and semi-urban patients. Participants A total of 36 providers at the training clinic/practice site and eight providers at the private primary pediatric clinic. Intervention An evidence-based messaging system that provides real-time evidence to providers based on prescribing practices for acute otitis media, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, constipation, pharyngitis, croup, urticaria, and bronchiolitis. Outcome measures Proportion of prescriptions given in accordance with the evidence. Results The proportion of prescriptions given in accordance with the evidence increased by four percentage points after intervention, from 38% at baseline to 42%. The control group improved by one percentage point from 39% at the beginning to 40% at the end of the trial. The adjusted difference between the intervention and control groups was 8% (95% confidence interval 1%, 15%). The effectiveness of the intervention did not decrease over time. Conclusion For common pediatric outpatient conditions, a point-of-care evidence-based prescriber and decision support system has been associated with significant improvements in prescribing practice.",1,1,
32,cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at implementing local quality improvement collaborations to improve general practitioners' prescribing and test ordering performance: study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The use of guidelines in general practice is not optimal. Although evidence-based methods exist to improve guideline adherence, differences in physician adherence to general practice guidelines remain relatively high. The aim of this study is to transfer a quality improvement strategy to the field based on supervision, feedback, training materials and peer group discussions led by local opinion leaders. Research questions are: is the multi-pronged strategy being implemented at scale as planned?""; what is the impact on GPs' test ordering and prescribing behavior?;"" and what are the costs of implementing the strategy? METHODS: To evaluate the effects, costs and feasibility of this new strategy, we are planning a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a balanced incomplete block design. Local GP groups in the south of the Netherlands already participating in pharmacotherapeutic audit meeting groups will be recruited by regional paramedics. Approximately 50 GP groups will be randomly divided into two branches. Two different sets of balanced clinical topics will be presented to these GPs. Each GP within a group will receive comparative feedback on test ordering and prescribing performance. Feedback will be discussed in the group and working agreements will be created after guidelines and barriers to change have been discussed. Data for feedback will be collected from existing and newly created databases, both initially and one year later. DISCUSSION: We are not aware of published studies on the successes and failures of GPs attempts to transfer a multifaceted strategy for test ordering and prescribing behavior to stakeholders in the field. This pragmatic work will focus on compatibility with existing infrastructure while allowing a certain degree of adaptation to local needs and routines.",0,0,
33,randomized cluster trial of standard quality improvement versus patient-centered interventions to improve depression care for African Americans in primary care: study protocol NCT00243425,"BACKGROUND: Several studies document disparities in care access and quality of care for African Americans. Research suggests that patient attitudes and clinician communication behaviors may contribute to these disparities. Evidence links patient-centered care to improvements in mental health outcomes"";"" Therefore, quality improvement interventions that increase this dimension of care are promising strategies for improving depression treatment and outcomes among African Americans. This article describes the design of the BRIDGE (Blacks Intervening for Depression and Empowering Blacks) Study. The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of two interventions - a standard quality improvement program and a patient-centered quality improvement program - for African-American patients with depression. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered group will have a greater reduction in depression symptoms, higher depression remission rates, and greater improvement in mental health functioning at six, twelve, and eighteen months compared to patients in the standard group. The study also examines patients' scores on care and receiving guidelines-compliant treatment for depression. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 36 primary care clinicians and their 132 African-American patients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in a randomized cluster study. The study uses intent-to-treat analysis to compare the effectiveness of standard quality improvement interventions (depression guidelines for clinicians and academic elaboration on disease-focused care management for their patients) and patient-centered quality improvement interventions (communication skills training to improve inclusion). It focused on decision making and management of care for clinicians, explanatory models to improve outcomes at 12-month follow-up, socio-cultural barriers, and treatment choices for their patients. CONCLUSION: The BRIDGE Study included clinicians and African-American patients working in underrepresented, underresourced community-based practices in clinical trials to improve depression care. The patient-centered and culturally targeted approach to the treatment of depression is a relatively new approach that has not been tested in most previous studies. The study will provide evidence as to whether patient-centered accommodations improve quality of care and outcomes to a greater extent than standard quality improvement strategies for African Americans with depression.

34,combined call alert and web-based tool changes clinician behavior and shortens hospital stay in acute pancreatitis,"OBJECTIVE: There are many clinical guidelines published for acute pancreatitis (AP). The implementation of these recommendations is variable. We hypothesized that a clinical decision support (CDS) tool would change clinician behavior and shorten hospital stay (LOS). METHODS: DESIGN/SETUP: Observational study titled AP Early Intervention (TAPER) Project. Tertiary center emergency department (ED) and hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two consecutive samplings from patients with ICD-9 code (577.0) for AP were generated from emergency room (ED) or hospital admissions. The diagnosis of AP was made according to the conventional Atlanta criteria. There were 110 patients in the Pre-TAPER-CDS-Agent group (5/30/06-6/22/07), 110 patients presenting to the emergency department with AP according to code 976 ICD-9 (577.0), and the Post-TAPER-CDS-Agent group (5/30 /06-6/22/07) had 113 for the 907 ICD-9 code (7/14/10-5/11). INTERVENTION: Developed on 12/2008-7/14/2010, the TAPER-CDS-Tool is an intuitive web-based point-of-care tool that sends texts to emergency room clinicians about a patient with AP - seven early management advice. RESULTS: Before and after TAPER-CDS-Tool batches had similar baseline characteristics. The post-TAPER-CDS-Mediator group met two management goals more frequently than the pre-TAPER-CDS-Agent group: risk stratification (P6L/1. 0-24 hours (P=0.0003) Mean (sd) hospital LOS was significant TAPER-CDS- Shorter (4.6 (3.1) vs. 6.7 (7.0) days in the post-Tool group, P=0.0126) Multivariate analysis identified four independent variables for hospital LOS: TAPER-CDS-Tool ( P=0.0049) associated with shorter LOS and more three variables associated with long LOS: Japanese severity score (P=0.0361), permanent organ failure (P=0.0088), and local pancreatic complications (<0.0001) RESULTS: associated with TAPER-CDS-Tool changed clinician behavior and had significant financial implications The hospital shortened the working hours.",0,0,

36,A community-based approach to promoting breastfeeding in Mexico,"comprehensive education strategy is offered, linking education, community education, research and mass media efforts to improve breastfeeding practices. It describes breastfeeding promotion models, an administrative system, and lessons learned during the project. It has been shown that the keys to effective breastfeeding promotion are “accurate information”, appropriate education, training and follow-up, and a supportive administrative system;” PIP: An operations research project designed to determine which intervention model was most successful in promoting breastfeeding among 585 urban women in Mexico began in 1986. Mothers in Chihuahua and both trained promoters and program supervisors train individuals or groups at Cuauhtemoc. Jalapa served as the control zone. The prevalence rate of breastfeeding in the 4 populations ranged from 64.5% to 81.3% prior to intervention and averaged 74.9% in the target group. After the intervention, the average for this group increased to 88.8%. Also, the breastfeeding prevalence rate for Jalapa dropped from 65.9-56%. In addition, while 70% of the women in the experimental group fed their babies only with breast milk during the first month, only 63.3% of the women in the control group breastfed their babies. In the following months, breastfeeding prevalence rates decreased by 13.7% and 14.7% (5 months) and 9.4% and 3.3% (6 months) in the experimental and control groups, respectively. Informal support groups for breastfeeding mothers were formed unexpectedly as a result of educational and outreach activities. The data showed that the intervention model using promoters was the most successful strategy. They also provided guidelines to researchers and other healthcare professionals interested in promoting community-based breastfeeding programs. For example, supervisors should not discourage promoters from addressing other community needs, as discouraging them could jeopardize their commitment to breastfeeding promotion. In addition, program planners should collect geographic and sociodemographic data on region and population prior to planning and response.",0,0,
37,Comparison of the effects of computer and manual reminders on mental health clinical practice guideline compliance.,"Objective: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of computer and manual reminder systems in the implementation of a clinical practice guideline. Design: 78 outpatients in a mental health clinic were randomly assigned to one of two reminder systems within the clinician. The CaseWalker computer system reminded clinicians when it was time to screen for mood disorder recommended by the guidelines, ensuring that the diagnosis of major depressive disorder met the criteria for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). and created a progress note. The manual system was a checklist attached to paper medical records. Criteria: The mood disorder screening rates of patients who were said to have major depressive disorder and the completeness of documents meeting the DSM-IV criteria were compared. Results: CaseWalker reported a higher screening rate for mood disorder (61 versus 86.5%, P = 0.008) and a higher rate of full documentation of the DSM-IV criteria (100 percent versus 100 percent) compared with the paper checklist. 5.6, P < 0.001). Results: Computer reminders were shown to be superior to manual reminders in improving adherence to clinical practice guidelines for depression in an outpatient mental health clinic.",0,1,
38,computer-based intervention to improve the relevance of antiepileptic drug level monitoring,"To improve compliance by reminding physicians when a potentially unnecessary test is requested and providing common indications for specific AED monitoring and pharmacokinetics, we designed and implemented 2 automated, computerized screens for use during antiepileptic drug (AED) test order entry. All computerized orders for inpatient serum AED levels over two 3-month periods were included in the study. During the 3-month period after the implementation of the automated response, 13% of all AED tests ordered were canceled after computerized reminders. The cancellation rate was 27% for orders that seemed overkill. For redundant orders, 4% were canceled when information on specific AED monitoring and pharmacokinetics was provided. The cancellation rate was sustained after 4 years. Despite a 19.3% increase in overall chemistry test volume, there has been a 19.5% decrease in total AED test volume since the implementation of this intervention. Nonconformity from repeated testing before pharmacological steady state was reached decreased from 54% to 14.6% of all AED orders. A simple, automated, activity-based intervention targeting a specific test order behavior effectively reduced inappropriate laboratory testing. The sustained benefit supports the idea that computerized interventions can permanently affect physician behavior. The computerized presentation of such evidence-based boundary guidelines can help narrow the gap between evidence and practice.",1,1,

DESIGN: A prospective trial to measure change in compliance compared to historical controls. MEASUREMENTS: LDS Hospital surgeons developed local consensus on which procedures should be DVT prophylaxis. The historical rate of prophylaxis for procedures was measured by searching the database of patient records. Next, a computerized reminder system using a specialist knowledge base and a time drive mechanism was implemented to flag surgical cases for DVT prophylaxis. A DVT reminder appeared in the OR schedule for eligible patients"";"" surgical staff used it as a guide for administering prophylaxis. The DVT prophylaxis rate was re-measured during the 3-month trial and compared with the pre-intervention rate. RESULTS: The pre-intervention rate of DVT prophylaxis over a 3-month period was 85.2% (785 of 921 eligible cases). During the 3 months following the introduction of the computerized reminder, compliance with DVT prophylaxis increased to 99.3% (1084 of 1092 eligible cases). The difference between background controls and study subjects was quite significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Computerized reminder is an effective method to increase the rate of DVT prophylaxis in surgical patients.",1,1,
42,computerized reminder system to increase the use of preventive care for hospitalized patients,"BACKGROUND Although effective in outpatient settings, computerized reminders have not been proven to increase preventive care in inpatient settings. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of computerized reminders on the rates of ordering four preventive treatments for inpatients. Over an 18-month study period, a computerized system processed online information for all 6371 patients admitted to a general medicine ward (for a total of 10,065 hospitalizations) and generated preventative care reminders as appropriate. Doctors in the intervention group saw these reminders when using a computerized order entry system for inpatients. RESULTS The reminder system identified 3416 patients (53.6 percent) who were not ordered by the attending physician as eligible for preventive measures. For patients with at least one indication, computerized reminders resulted in higher adjusted order rates for pneumococcal vaccine (35.8 percent of patients in the intervention group and 0.8 percent of those in the control group, P<0.001), flu vaccine (51.4 percent). ) 1.0 percent, P<0.001), prophylactic heparin (32.2 percent versus 18.9 percent, P<0.001) and prophylactic aspirin at discharge (36.4 versus 27.6 percent, P<0.001).

43,"concept for the implementation and evaluation of the guideline ""Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer in Germany""","Systematically developed, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines are important tools for improving healthcare. The effectiveness of a guideline is not only related to its methodological quality, but also to the implementation strategy used. The following document describes the systematic development of a strategy for the implementation and evaluation of the guideline ""Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer in Germany"" as part of a national project. A multifaceted systematic implementation strategy has been developed that addresses existing barriers and builds on recently implemented projects in Germany to improve the early detection and treatment of breast cancer. The aim is to provide behavioral change in physicians as health care recipients and health care providers who take part in the medical decision-making process within the scope of the guideline. It also supports organizational changes to ensure compliance with the guideline through quality assurance and quality management. A set of quality indicators have been identified for the baseline assessment of structures, provider performance and results to enable evaluation of the implementation process. Both the effectiveness of the implementation process and the effectiveness of the guideline will be measured using the same indicators for reassessment within a predetermined 18-month timeframe. The quasi-experimental design of this uncontrolled pre- and post-administration study outlined in this paper allows evaluation of clinically relevant changes using quality indicators that measure the effectiveness of the guideline at the national level.",0,0,
44,controlled trial incorporating symptom data into computer-based care recommendations for managing patients with chronic heart failure.,"Background Heart failure is common and associated with significant morbidity and cost, but physician adherence to treatment guidelines is sub-optimal. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether adding symptom information to evidence-based, computer-generated care recommendations could affect treatment decisions among primary care physicians caring for heart failure patients at two Veterans Affairs medical centers. Methods Physicians were randomly assigned to receive either care recommendations generated from electronic medical record data and symptom data from questionnaires sent to patients within 2 weeks of scheduled outpatient visits (intervention group) or recommendations generated solely from electronic medical record data (control group). Patients required a diagnosis of heart failure and objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. At 6 and 12 months after enrollment, we evaluated physician compliance with heart failure guidelines and patients' New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, quality of life, satisfaction with care, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits. Results Patients in the intervention (n = 355) and control (n = 365) groups were similar at baseline. At 12 months, there was no significant difference in adherence to care recommendations between physicians in the intervention and control groups (33% vs 30%, P = 0.4). There was also no significant difference in NYHA class (P = 0.1) and quality of life measures (P > 0.1), nor was there a difference in the number of outpatient visits between intervention and control patients (6.7 vs 7.1 visits, P = 0.48). Intervention patients were more satisfied with their doctor (P = 0.02) and primary care visit (P = 0.02), but at 6 months (1.5 vs 0.7 hospitalizations, P = 0.0002) and 12 months (2.3 vs. 2.3 hospitalizations, P = 0.0002) had more all-cause hospitalizations. 1.7 hospitalizations, P = 0.05).

46,2006 cross-sectional study of the number and frequency of terms used to refer to information translation in a health literature: Tower of Babel?,"The effort to put research findings into practice is growing rapidly and has acquired many competing names (eg, dissemination, reception, exploitation, translation) and contributing disciplines. The use of multiple terms across disciplines creates barriers to communication and progress in applying research findings. In a health literature review published in 2006, we attempted to create an inventory of terms describing this field and how often the authors used them. Methods We call this area information translation (KT). Terms and definitions describing the characteristics of KT were collected from the literature, the Internet, reports, textbooks, and communication with experts. We compiled a database of KT and other articles by reading 12 health journals representing multiple disciplines. All articles published in these journals in 2006 were categorized as KT or not. KT articles (all KT) were further categorized, if possible, by whether they described KT projects or practices (KT practice articles) or presented the theoretical basis, models, tools, methods or techniques of KT (KT theory articles). Accuracy was checked using double-reading. Specially designed software determined how often the terms KT were used in the titles and abstracts of the articles categorized as PT. Results A total of 2,603 articles were evaluated and 581 were identified as KT articles. Of these, 201 described KT applications and 153 included KT theory. Of the 100 collected KT terms, 46 were used in the titles or abstracts of the articles categorized as KT by the authors. For all 581 KT articles, the eight terms or term variations used by the authors were highly distinctive (p < 0.001) to separate KT and non-KT articles: implementation, adoption, quality improvement, dissemination, complex intervention (multi-finite), implementation (three word) research and complex intervention. More KT terms were associated with KT practice articles (n = 13) and KT theory articles (n = 18). Results We collected 100 terms describing KT research. The authors used 46 of them in the titles and abstracts of KT articles. About half of these differentiated between KT and non-KT articles. Therefore, the need for consolidation and the consistent use of fewer terms related to KT research are clear.",0,0,
47,Formative Study of Colon Cancer Surveillance Care: Effects of Survivor Centered Interventions,"Colon cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States, and the increase in survivors has highlighted the need to improve the quality of colon cancer surveillance care. Post-treatment surveillance includes follow-up care visits and testing, as well as psychosocial support and lifestyle counseling. This formative study explored individual, interpersonal, and organizational-level factors associated with adherence to surveillance care guidelines to identify modifiable factors for potential educational intervention strategies. A suitable sample of 22 survivors (12 women and 10 men) from two cancer centers were recruited after completing treatment to attend focus groups or key informative phone interviews to carefully explore their experiences and complete a short questionnaire. Content analysis was used to identify themes. The results confirmed that survivors navigate a complex surveillance care program and have a strong trust in healthcare providers who guide their follow-up care experience. Participants defined the terms ""survival"" and ""follow"" in a variety of different ways. Individual-level themes critical to survivors' experiences were having a positive attitude, trusting one's faith, and coping with fears. Interpersonal-level themes centered around interactions and communication with family and healthcare providers in follow-up care. While organizational-level factors are rarely highlighted, respondents rated office reminder systems and communication between multiple providers as valuable. Educational interventions that leverage survivors' connections with their physicians and focus on preparing survivors for what to expect in the next phase of their cancer experience can be useful in mobilizing survivors at the end of treatment to transition into the post-treatment period.",0,0,
48,framework for good practice in interagency responses to cases of self-neglect,"Self-neglect is probably more common than is generally thought and poses a host of difficult conceptual, identification and intervention problems for health and social care workers. These patient management issues are compounded by the lack of any evidence base for practice that nurses can draw upon when faced with managing people who neglect themselves. Nurses who work with self-neglects work in an interdisciplinary context that includes professional groups such as environmental health workers who are not normally involved in health and social care teams. In the absence of such an evidence base, a pragmatic solution has been proposed in the form of a framework for inter-agency practice. The background supporting this framework, including a research study on self-neglect and sheltering in inter-agency responses, is briefly summarized in this paper.",0,0,
49,Framework to Assist Healthcare Professionals in Recommending High-Quality Practices to Support Chronic Disease Self-Management: An Explanatory Evaluation of Type 2 Diabetes Practices,"BACKGROUND: This article provides an approach to assist healthcare professionals in recommending high-quality practices to support self-management of chronic diseases. Most app reviews focus on popularity, aesthetics, functionality, usability, and information quality. There is no doubt that these factors are important in choosing reliable applications that appeal to users, but behavioral theory can also be useful in matching applications to user needs. OBJECTIVE: The developed framework aims to be methodologically sound, to be able to select popular practices that include content covered by evidence-based programs, to be consistent with behavioral theory, and to adopt a patient-centered approach to tailor practices to individual patients' needs. METHODS: A single disease type 2 diabetes was chosen to demonstrate how the framework could be applied because it was considered to represent the types of strategies used in many chronic diseases. A systematic approach was developed to match practices to patients' needs, based on behavioral theory and recommendations from best practice guidelines. In March 2014, a set of search strategies was used to identify the highest-rated iPhone and Android health apps representing 29 subjects from five categories of type 2 diabetes self-management strategies. Topics are selected from published international guidelines for diabetes management. The senior author (KH) evaluated the most popular applications addressing these topics using the Behavior Theory Content Questionnaire (BTS), which is based on traditional behavioral theory. A tool to aid decision making when using apps, developed and tested with healthcare professionals for ease of use and understanding. RESULTS: A total of 14 practices were evaluated, representing all five subject categories of self-management. Total theoretical scores (BTS scores) were less than 50 on a 100-point scale for all applications. Each app received less than 50% of the possible total BTS score for all four behavioral theories and most of the 20 behavioral strategies"";"" however, apps scored higher than 50% of the total possible BTS score for certain strategies related to their primary focus. Our findings suggest that the treatments studied will be more effective when used in combination with therapy rather than alone. Practices were categorized by topic and basic intervention strategies. A framework has been developed to match practices to patient needs identified based on patient-centered care principles and practice categorization. The approach was well accepted and understood by an appropriate example of health practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The presented framework can be used by healthcare practitioners to better match practices with client needs. Some applications include highly interactive strategies of behavioral theory and can increase patient engagement and efficacy of therapy when used as an adjunct.",0,0,
50,"French version of the Obvious Behavior Scale (OBS), which measures challenging behavior following acquired brain injury: Echelle des compportements observables (ECO)","OBJECTIVE: To develop the French version of the Open Behavior Scale (OBS) and to examine its psychometric properties. METHODS: The scale was adapted and validated according to standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of questionnaires (Echelle des compportements observables"";"" ECO). The reliability and construct validity of the ECO were studied among 29 inpatients and outpatients with an acquired brain injury. The instruments were administered by 12 clinicians from eight rehabilitation centers and local brain injury associations. RESULTS: ECO provided behavioral profile descriptors very similar to the original scale. It showed excellent reliability and good convergent and differential validity, as reflected by the significant associations with other measures containing similar behavioral items, and the absence of meaning correlations with broader constructs such as physical and cognitive abilities.

51,Effects of handheld computer smoking intervention tool and physician smoking cessation counseling,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a handheld smoking cessation intervention tool designed to assist physicians in counseling patients to quit smoking. METHODS: This study used a pre/post survey design with a trial period of 4 months for the software. Study participants included 22 faculty and assistant physicians from the University of Virginia. Paired samples t-tests were used to assess mean differences in 4 major subscales (physician behaviour, attitudes, comfort and knowledge of counseling patients about smoking cessation). RESULTS: No statistically significant mean differences were found for physician behavior (mean increase = 0.44, P = .55) or physician attitude (mean increase = 0.44, P = .16). A statistically significant mean increase of 2.29 was observed for the physician comfort subscale (t = 3.87, df = 16, P = .001). Physicians noted greater comfort (P = .007) in counseling patients about smoking cessation and greater comfort (P = .012) in using Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. CONCLUSION: Physician comfort level in counseling patients about smoking cessation can be increased with hand-held computer software. When used in conjunction with other practice modifications, this tool has the potential to improve physician smoking cessation intervention practices.",0,1,
52,"mixed activity-practice cluster randomized group CBT trial for anxiety in urban schools: rationale, design, and methods","Background Schools offer a context with great potential for the implementation of psychosocial evidence-based practices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has been found to be very effective in treating anxiety in a variety of community settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is an effective group CBT protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, evidence-based practices for anxiety are rarely used in under-resourced urban schools because many treatment protocols are not suitable for the urban school context or population, existing behavioral health personnel do not receive adequate training or support to allow them. school districts do not have the resources to engage in treatment faithfully or to contract external counselors. In our previous work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally sensitive, focused and applicable CBT protocol (CBT for the Treatment of Anxiety in Schools (CATS)) for anxiety disorders. Methods/design The purpose of this 5-year study was to both evaluate the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools versus the original FRIENDS, and compare implementation strategies (instructor-train-instructor-train?+ ?ongoing consultation), 18 K-8 urban states school by conducting a three-arm, parallel group, type 2 hybrid efficacy-practice trial. We will also evaluate cost effectiveness and loyalty mediators and moderators. Ninety therapists, 18 agency supervisors and 360 children will attend. The interactive systems framework for dissemination and practice guides training and support procedures for therapists and supervisors. Discussion This study has the potential to demonstrate that agency therapists and supervisors with little or no prior exposure to evidence-based practices (EBPs) can faithfully practice an anxiety disorder EBP. Comparison of implementation strategies will provide large urban mental health systems with data to make decisions regarding the adoption of EBPs.",0,0,
53,"low-fat vegan diet induces more macronutrient changes, but is comparable in adherence and acceptability among individuals with type 2 diabetes to a more traditional diabetes diet.","BACKGROUND: Although therapeutic diets are critical for diabetes management, their acceptability by patients has not been largely studied. OBJECTIVE: To measure adherence and acceptability for two types of diets for diabetes. DESIGN: Controlled trial conducted between 2004 and 2006. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Individuals with type 2 diabetes in a community-based research facility (n=99). Participants were randomly assigned to either a diet that followed 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat, vegan diet for 74 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attrition, adherence, dietary behavior, diet acceptability, and craving. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The t-tests for nutrient intake and survey scores determined between-group differences. For dietary acceptability measures, relevant samples Wilcoxon total rank test evaluated within-group changes""; independent samples compared Mann-Whitney U test diet groups. Changes in symptoms reported between groups were compared using chi(2) for independent samples. RESULTS: All participants recorded the first 22 weeks. 90% (45/50) of the American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group and 86% (42/49) of the vegan diet group participants completed 74 weeks Fat and cholesterol intakes decreased further, and carbohydrate and fiber intake was greater in the vegan group At 22 weeks, group-specific diet adherence criteria were met by 44% (22/50) members of the American Diabetes Association diet group and 67% (33/49) of vegans-group participants (P=0.019); Association guidelines diet group reported a greater increase in dietary restriction; this difference was not significant at 74 weeks. Both groups reported reduced hunger and decreased disinhibition. Survey responses rated both diets as satisfactory, with no significant differences between groups, except for ease of preparation, where 22-week ratings marginally supported the American Diabetes Association guideline group. Cravings for fatty foods were further reduced in the vegan group at 22 weeks, with no significant difference at 74 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Despite greater impact on macronutrient intake, a low-fat, vegan diet has similar acceptability to a more traditional diabetes diet. Its acceptability does not seem to preclude its use in medical nutrition therapy.",0,0,
54,Meta-analysis of the relationship between adherence to medication and mortality,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between adherence to drug therapy, including placebo, and mortality. DESIGN Meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases, communication with researchers, and reviews of textbooks and engagement. Review methods Predefined criteria were used to select studies reporting mortality among participants with good and poor adherence to drug therapy. Data were extracted for the disease, drug treatment groups, methods of measuring compliance rate, definition of good adherence, and mortality rate. RESULTS Data were obtained from 21 studies (46,847 participants), including eight studies (19,633 participants) with placebo arms. Compared with poor fit, good fit was associated with a lower mortality rate (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.63). Good adherence to placebo was associated with lower mortality (0.56, 0.43 to 0.74), as was good adherence to beneficial drug therapy (0.55, 0.49 to 0.62). Good adherence to harmful drug therapy was associated with increased mortality (2.90, 1.04 to 8.11). CONCLUSION Good adherence to drug therapy is associated with positive health outcomes. Furthermore, the observed association between good adherence to placebo and mortality supports the existence of a 'healthy adherence' effect, whereby adherence to medication may be a surrogate marker for overall healthy behavior.",0,0,
55,midwifery-led in-hospital birthing center within an academic medical center: achievements and challenges,"University of California San Diego Community Women's Health Program (CWHP) has emerged as a successful and sustainable coexistence model of women's health services. The cornerstone of this midwifery practice is California's only in-hospital birthing center. Located inside the medical center, this unique and physically separate birth center has been the site for more than 4000 births. It is an exceptional example of low-intervention care with 10% cesarean section and 98% breastfeeding rates. Integrating this previously independent birth center into an academic center brought with it attempts at mistrust and ineffective communication. Education, coherent leadership, and the development of multidisciplinary guidelines have helped to meet these challenges. This collaborative model provides a structure where residents learn to be respectful counselors and appreciate differences in medical practice. CWHP and the Birth Center show that through permanence and resilience, a collaborative maternity care model can evolve and positively impact not only new families but also the next generation of providers.",0,0,
56,"migraine management training program for primary care providers: An overview of survey and pilot study findings, lessons learned, and considerations for further research","BACKGROUND: There are five to nine million primary care office visits per year for migraine in the United States. However, migraine care in primary care is often inadequate. A previous study noted that primary care physicians (PCPs) want to have direct contact with headache specialists to improve the migraine care they provide. OBJECTIVE: We sought to further examine PCPs' knowledge of migraine management and evaluate the feasibility of a multimodal migraine training program for PCPs. METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire assessing the knowledge of PCPs about migraine. We then hosted three live training sessions and developed an email consultation service for PCPs to post any questions they have about migraine. We report both quantitative and qualitative findings. RESULTS: Twenty-one PCP completed the questionnaire. They were generally familiar with the epidemiology of migraine (mean prevalence of migraine 12.6% +/- 10.1), psychiatric comorbidities (mean prevalence of comorbid depression 24.5% +/- 16.7%, prevalence of comorbid anxiety 24.6% +/- 18.3) and evidence-based behavioral treatments . Fifty-six percent cited cognitive behavioral therapy, 78% biofeedback, and 61% relaxation therapy as evidence-based treatments. Although most were aware of the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, they did not routinely assess them (43% did not routinely assess anxiety, 29% did not routinely assess depression). PCPs frequently reported referrals for non-A-level evidence-based treatments: special diets (60%), acupuncture (50%), physical therapy (30%), and psychoanalysis (20%). Relaxation therapy was a treatment recommended by 40% of PCPs. Only 10% reported seeking cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback. 19 percent used little or no anti-migraine medications. Seventy-two percent were unaware or little aware of the American Academy of Neurology guidelines for migraine. Participation in training sessions varied (N=22 1st session, 6 2nd session, 15 3rd session). Few used the PCP email advisory service (N=4). CONCLUSIONS: While PCPs are familiar with many aspects of migraine care, there is a need and opportunity for improvement. The three live sessions were poorly attended and the email consultation service was seldom used. We provide an in-depth discussion of targeted areas for educational intervention, challenges in developing a migraine education program for PCPs, and future areas of study.",0,0,
57,model for collaboration in quality improvement projects: implementing a weight-based heparin dosing nomogram in an integrated healthcare delivery system,"BACKGROUND: At Aurora Health Care, an integrated practice system based in Milwaukee, a systems-level clinical quality improvement department was established in 1995 to facilitate collaboration on clinical quality improvement (QI) initiatives. COLLABORATIVE MODEL: A model was developed to use the expertise within the system and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and procurement was provided for the interventions of the project at the point of service delivery. It was believed that a single team could design improvement efforts or guidelines and then work with a different group of people at a more local level to implement the processes. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO THE HPARIN QI PROJECT: Anticoagulation with heparin is considered the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. However, a large gap was found between current anticoagulant practices and published best practices regarding achieving a key process measure. To reduce the overall time to achieve effective anticoagulation, a systems-level team created an intervention consisting predominantly of a pre-printed order sheet, including a weight-based heparin dosing nomogram, and an education plan for physicians and other healthcare professionals. Significant improvement was observed at all pilot sites where overall adequate anticoagulation rates increased from 73% to 95% within the first 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The system was able to standardize care in four of its five major hospitals and deliver better patient outcomes to the wider population, and then repeat the heparin project at four additional centers over a six-month period. This model has been successfully applied to other quality improvement projects.",0,0,
58,modeling tool for policy analysis to support the design of efficient and effective policy responses to complex public health problems,"Background In the design of public health policy, a broader understanding of risk factors for lifelong disease and a growing awareness of the social determinants of health have led to the development of broader, cross-sectoral strategies to tackle complex issues. . However, comprehensive strategies may not represent the most efficient or effective approach to reduce the burden of disease at the population level. Instead, they can move to allocate limited resources less intensively to a larger number of programs and initiatives, reducing the potential impact of investment. While analytical tools that use research evidence exist to help identify and prioritize disease risk factors for public health action, they are insufficient to support more targeted and effective policy responses to complex public health problems. Discussion This article discusses the limitations of commonly used analytical tools to support evidence-based policy decisions for complex problems. It proposes an alternative policy analysis tool that can integrate various sources of evidence and provide a platform for virtually testing policy alternatives to design efficient, effective and equitable solutions. The case of suicide prevention in Australia is presented to illustrate the limitations of existing tools to adequately inform prevention policy and discusses the usefulness of the new policy analysis tool. Summary Contrary to popular belief, a systems approach goes beyond comprehensive thinking and seeks to determine where best to target public health action and resources for optimal effect. It primarily deals with what can reasonably be excluded from prevention strategies and can be used to explore where investment can occur without adversely affecting population health (or equity). Simulation modeling used for policy analysis holds promise for being able to better operationalize research evidence to support decision making for complex problems, improve the targeting of public health policy, and provides a foundation for strengthening relationships among policymakers, stakeholders and researchers.",0,0,
59,national cross-sectional study of socio-behavioral factors affecting physicians' decisions to initiate antimicrobial therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: Current efforts to prevent antimicrobial resistance include limiting antimicrobial use, providing education on appropriate use, and developing better point-of-care testing, but what do doctors really think about rational prescribing and potential interventions? We sought to determine what factors may influence a physician's decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy in a patient and their views on measures to promote rational prescribing. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of 10,600 doctors from the medical records of all known board-certified doctors in Germany. RESULTS: Of the respondents (n = 3,492""; 33%;"" including detailed analysis of non-response bias), 90% reported that they decided to start antimicrobial therapy in one patient at least once a week, and 66% decided daily. We identified correlations in one patient's decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy. Estimates were hospital physician status (odds ratio (OR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.68)), male physician (OR 1.81 (95% CI 1.42–2.31)), age 50–59 years (OR) . 1.56 (95% CI 1.10-2.21)) and practice in states in the former East Germany (OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.15-2.21)). Each specialist was significantly less likely than ENTs and urologists to decide to initiate a course of antimicrobial therapy. Other predictors agreed to be on the safe side (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.03-1.76)) believing that the quality of prescribing practice improved after continuing education from pharmaceutical companies (OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.84)) and for resistant pathogens. having failed treatment experience (OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.83-3.19)). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in our example decide to initiate antimicrobial therapy on a patient and value intervention to support prudent use, such as continuing education, implementation guidelines and surveillance measures. Socio-behavioral factors, regional differences, gender and age deserve further research to explore relevant influencing factors and to promote rational antimicrobial prescribing.",0,0,
60,new tool for assessing wandering risk in hospitalized patients,"This article describes the development and implementation of a mobile screening and intervention program based on identifying hospitalized patients with impaired cognition and mobility. A mobile screening tool developed by a multidisciplinary team was associated with appropriate levels of intervention available in the electronic health record. Advanced practice nurses (APNs) validated the accuracy of screening and interventions by bedside nurses for all patients who tested positive. Of the 1,528 hospitalized patients over a 3-week period, 48 (3.1%) were positive for navigation. Patients at risk were older (age >/= 65) (66.7%), those admitted to surgical units (41.7%), Caucasian (89.6%), and males (58.3%). Thirteen (27.1%) had dementia and 45 (93.8%) had cognitive impairment. Of the patients screened positive for crawling, APNs agreed with the bedside nurses' assessment of the risk of wandering in 79.2% (38/48) of cases and 89.5% (34/38 true positives) for interventions. The two-item crawling tool and intervention could be used by bedside nurses. Further studies are needed to determine whether this tool is effective in preventing entanglement.",0,0,
61,"Pan-Canadian practice guideline: prevention, screening, evaluation and treatment of sleep disorders in adults with cancer","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide recommendations on optimal strategies and interventions for the prevention, screening, evaluation and management of cancer-related sleep disorder (insomnia and insomnia syndrome) in adult cancer populations. METHODS: A systematic search of the published health literature was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and other guidance documents. The Sleep Disorder Expert Panel [consisting of nurses, psychologists, primary care physicians, oncologists, doctors specializing in sleep disorders, researchers, and guideline methodologists] reviewed, discussed, and approved the final guideline. Health professionals in Canada were asked to provide feedback through an external review process. RESULTS: Three clinical practice guidelines and 12 randomized controlled trials were identified as the evidence base. Overall, despite the paucity of evidence, the evidence and expert consensus suggest that it is important to routinely screen and evaluate adult cancer patients for sleep disorders using standard screening tools. While prevention of sleep disturbance is the desired goal, cognitive behavioral therapies are effective in improving sleep outcomes. As part of an external review of 16 healthcare providers, 81% said they accepted the recommendations in writing. CONCLUSIONS: Difficulty sleeping is a common problem in cancer populations that needs greater recognition by healthcare professionals. Prevention, screening, evaluation and treatment strategies supported by the best available evidence are critical. Suggestions for implementation and maintenance path algorithms are presented.",0,0,
62,patient-initiated system for preventive health care.,"Purpose To test the effectiveness of a patient-initiated, touch-sensitive computer system (TSCS) to improve screening rates for cancers of the breast, cervix, colon and rectum, and oral cavity. Design One-year, randomized, controlled trial with primary care practice as the unit of analysis. Setting Sixty primary care practices randomly selected from 329 non-educational practices in a southeastern state. Subjects A random sample of 507 TSCS users and a random sample from the medical records of 50 male and female adult patients before intervention and 50 adult patients after intervention at each administration. Interventions A registered nurse acting as a liaison officer in touch-sensitive computer system and work practices. TSCS provided patient-specific preventative service recommendations and streamlined the workflow to increase the completion of these interventions. Main Outcome Measure Average change in proportion of eligible patients undergoing screening mammography, clinical breast examination, digital rectal examination, stool occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, Papanicolaou smear and smear examination, adjusted for use of health care examination (HME) and TSCS oral cavity examination. Results We observed a significant increase in completion of mammography screening (6.6%""; P<=.05) and clinical breast examination (6.1%; P<=.01) in women aged 50 years and older who had an HME during the study year. Results Patients with HMEs are more likely to receive cancer screening; however, a computer-based system for preventive services could contribute to improving screening. Among patients without HME, TSCS users had higher rates of breast cancer screening than nonusers.",0,1,
63,peer review feedback method promoting adherence to preventive care guidelines in an established ambulatory care clinic,"BACKGROUND: The simple distribution of clinical practice guidelines to physicians does not change practice behavior. A low-cost, continuous peer review feedback method was used to encourage resident physicians in the outpatient clinic at Marshall University School of Medicine (Huntington, West Virginia) to comply with nine preventive care guidelines. METHODS: Preventive care guidelines were distributed and a peer review feedback program was initiated in the resident primary care practice. The frequency of resident physician use of nine preventive care services was evaluated and compared over three periods: preliminary guideline (September 1, 1993 - March 1, 1994""; 148 patients), guideline (September 1, 1994 - March 1, 1995; 148 patients), and one-year follow-up (1 September 1995 - March 1, 1996;"" 150 patients). Patients in the three periods were similar in terms of age, gender, and risk of influenza and pneumococcal infection. CONCLUSIONS: During the guideline period, resident doctors provided patients with four preventive care services: tetanus toxoid vaccine, clinical breast exam, Papanicolaou smear test, and hemoccult test, significantly more frequently than during the guideline period. All services were offered significantly more frequently than during the one-year follow-up period and as frequently as during the guideline period. CONCLUSION: A low-cost, ongoing peer review feedback program significantly and permanently improves resident's compliance with clinical practice guidelines for preventive care services. However, the effectiveness of the bad review feedback method cannot be generalized to the private practice or other settings. Research on other methods should continue to promote compliance with clinical practice guidelines and influence physician behavior in general.",0,1,
64,Pilot study of an interprofessional evidence-based electronic care planning tool for clients with mental health problems and addictions,"BACKGROUND: The health system must develop effective solutions to the growing challenges it faces in relation to individuals with mental health disorders and addictions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability of an information translation system aimed at improving client-centered, evidence-based care for hospitalized schizophrenia patients and its potential impact on outcomes. METHOD: Pre-posttest design was used. The e-Volution-TREAT system was implemented in two inpatient units in a large mental health facility. 37 nurses, allied health workers and physicians from two units participated in the study. Data collection included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and observations. Outcome data from thirty-eight consenting customers were collected from institutional records. RESULTS: Overall, staff participants were very satisfied with the functionality of the e-Volution-TREAT system. Barriers to using the system were identified by the participants regarding the work environment, insufficient staffing, equipment problems, discomfort with technology, and focusing on short-term goals rather than long-term goals. There was moderate acceptance of guidelines on social issues and low uptake of guidelines on family support and addictions. Over time, there have been significant improvements in four client outcomes, particularly aggressive behavior, depression, withdrawal, and psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, users were overall satisfied with the e-Volution-TREAT system, although users expressed difficulties with the workload that interfered with their time to use the system. It would be premature to conclude that the change in patient outcomes is related to the e-Volution-TREAT system without a randomized controlled trial with results compared to a control group. Future research should include strategies to change the context and involve clinicians in an influential position to model change.",0,1,
65,population-based cross-sectional study of colorectal cancer screening practices of first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the proportions and predictors of first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) who (i) had any CRC testing and (ii) received CRC screening in accordance with CRC screening guidelines. . METHODS: Colorectal cancer patients and their FDRs were recruited through the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry in Victoria, Australia. Seven hundred and seven FDRs completed their phone call. Of these, 405 FDRs were considered asymptomatic and suitable for analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of FDRs received any CRC test. Elderly people who were asked about a family history of CRC by a doctor before, those with first-degree relatives, private health insurance, siblings, and FDRs were significantly more likely than their peers to have had a previous CRC test. Twenty-five percent of ""at or slightly above average risk"" FDRs adhered to CRC screening guidelines. For this group, male FDRs and those with higher levels of education were significantly more likely to adhere to the screening recommended by the guideline. For 'moderately high risk' and 'potentially high risk' subjects, 47% and 49% followed the CRC screening guidelines, respectively. For this group, screening recommended by the guidelines was significantly more likely to occur for FDRs living in metropolitan areas, siblings, married or partnered, and those asked about a family history of CRC. RESULTS: Significant non-compliance with screening guidelines was evident among FDRs. Developed CRC screening in accordance with guidelines and effective systematic interventions are needed to increase screening rates among population groups experiencing inequality.

66,primary care nurse-led gait intervention in older adults: PACE (pedometer accelerometer consultation assessment)-Lift cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In older people, brisk walking can increase step count and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at intervals >/=10 minutes as recommended in World Health Organization guidelines. Previous interventions have reported step count increases but not changes in objectively measured MVPA in older people. We evaluated whether a complex intervention delivered by a primary care nurse increased objectively measured step counts and MVPA. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 988, aged 60-75 years, randomly selected from three UK family practices and able to increase walking, were invited to participate in a parallel two-arm cluster randomized trial""; Randomization was done on a home basis. Two hundred - 250 households between 2011 and 2012 98 people were chosen at random."" 150 people to the intervention group, 148 to the usual care control group. Intervention participants received four primary nurse physical activity (PA) counseling over 3 months, which included behavior modification techniques, pedometer step count and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, and an individual PA diary and plan. Evaluators were not blinded to group status, but statistical analyzes were performed blinded. The primary outcome is the change in average daily steps evaluated by accelerometer between baseline and 3 months, while the change at 12 months is a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes were weekly change in bouts of >/=10 minutes from baseline to time, accelerometer counts, and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months in MVPA. Other outcomes were adverse events, anthropometric measures, mood, and pain. Qualitative assessments of intervention participants and practice nurses assessed the acceptability of the intervention. At 3 months, eight participants were withdrawn or followed up, with 280 (94%) providing primary outcome data. At 3 months, changes in both mean daily step counts and weekly MVPA in bouts >/= 10 minutes were significantly higher in the intervention than in the control: 1,037 (95% CI 513-1,560) steps per day and 63 (95%) CI 40- 87) minutes/week, respectively. The corresponding differences at 12 months were 609 (95% CI 104-1,115) steps/day and 40 (95% CI 17-63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects to steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in the two groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable and enjoyable. RESULTS: The PACE-Lift trial increased both step counts and objectively measured MVPA in bouts >/=10 minutes at 3 and 12 months in 60-75 year olds and had no effect on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to demonstrate objective MVPA increases in this age group, emphasizing the value of individualized support that includes objective PA assessment in primary care.

67,process to develop community consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,"There are great differences between the practice patterns of pediatricians and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the assessment and treatment of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A few studies raise additional concerns about access to ADHD treatment for girls, blacks, and poorer individuals. Barriers can arise at many levels, including identification and referral by school staff, help-seeking behavior of parents, diagnosis by the medical provider, treatment decisions, and acceptance of treatment. Such findings confirm the importance of establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that children of both sexes and all socioeconomic, racial and ethnic groups receive appropriate assessment and treatment. The publication of the AAP ADHD toolkit provides resources to assist in applying ADHD guidelines in clinical practice. These resources address a number of barriers to office practice, including unfamiliarity with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, difficulty identifying comorbidities, and insufficient knowledge of effective coding practices. Also very important for the success of improved processes in clinical practice is community cooperation in care, especially cooperation with the education system. Such collaboration addresses other barriers to good care, such as pressure from parents and schools to prescribe stimulant prescriptions, cultural biases that may prevent schools from evaluating children for ADHD or discourage families from seeking health care, and inconsistencies in recognition and referral in schools. same system. Collaboration can also create efficiency in data collection and school-physician communication, thereby reducing the non-face-to-face (and therefore non-refundable) element of care for doctors. This article describes a process used in Guilford County, North Carolina to develop consensus among healthcare providers, educators, and child advocates on the assessment and treatment of children with ADHD symptoms. The result, a community protocol followed by school staff and community doctors for >10 years, enables communication and collaboration between educators and physicians in the evaluation and treatment of children with ADHD symptoms. This protocol has the potential to increase practice efficiency, improve practice standards for children with ADHD, and enhance children's identity in schools. Perhaps most importantly, the community process in which the protocol is developed and implemented has an educational component that increases school staff's knowledge of ADHD and its treatment, increases the likelihood that referrals are appropriate, and increases the likelihood that children will benefit from coordination. Interventions among school staff, physicians, and parents The Protocol reflects a consensus of school staff and community health care providers regarding the following: (1) “ideal ADHD assessment and management principles”; (2) a common practice in schools for children who need assessment due to inattention and classroom entry point (a team) Behavior problems, problems first arise in a health facility, behavioral health system, or school; (3) observes a protocol followed by the school system, which recognizes schools' resource limitations but meets the needs of community health care providers for the classroom, psychoeducational testing, parent and teacher behavior rating scales, and functional assessment; (4) a package of information on each child identified as needing medical evaluation; (5) a contact person or team from school to retrieve the package at each doctor's office and direct it to the appropriate clinician; ( 6) an evaluation process that investigates comorbidities and applies the appropriate diagnosis criteria; (7) evidence-based interventions; (8) follow-up processes of children after a treatment plan has been established; (9) the role of central participants (school staff, doctors, school nurses and mental health professionals) in the assessment, management and follow-up of children with attention problems; (10) forms for collecting and exchanging information at each step; (11) processes and key people for communication flow at every step; and (12) a plan to educate school and health professionals about the new processes. A reiteration of the community process initiated in Forsyth County, North Carolina in 2001, offers insights into the role of AAP ADHD guidelines in facilitating the development of a community consensus protocol. This repetition also highlights barriers to identification and orientation at the school level. The following recommendations from 2 community processes explain the role of physicians in the collaborative community care of children with ADHD symptoms. (1) Agree with the school system on the role of school staff in collecting data for children with learning and behavior problems; components to consider include (a) vision and hearing screening, (b) school/academic backgrounds, (c) by a counselor classroom observation, (d) parent and teacher behavior rating scales (eg, Vanderbilt, Conner, or Achenbach scales), (e) assessment of speech/language assessment, (f) screening intelligence test, (g) screening achievement test, (h) full intelligence and achievement testing and (i) classroom intervention trials if abbreviated tests show inconsistencies (2) Use pediatric office visits to identify children with academic or behavioral problems and signs of inattention (history or questionnaire) (3) Recruit identified children in accordance with community consensus direct to the contact person in each child's school by requesting information (4) Determine a contact person who will receive the school materials for the application. review the package and incorporate school data into clinical assessment. (6) The need for multifaceted intervention, including academic and study strategies for the classroom and home, differences between cognitive level and achievement learning or language barrier, and an individualized education plan (special education), an individualized education plan or 504 plan (classroom accommodation) consideration of designation ""with other health problems"" as an alternative route, behavior modification techniques for targeted behavioral problems, and drug trials as indicated. (7) Refer the patient to a mental health professional if the assessment suggests co-existing conditions. (8) Use contact forms to share diagnosis and medication information, suggested interventions, and follow-up plans with school and family. (9) Obtain required teacher and parent follow-up reports and make adjustments to therapy based on child's functioning in targeted areas.

In addition, the intervention had no statistically significant effect on patient outcomes, care after hospital discharge, and patient satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: Patients in this study generally had shorter lengths of stay than recommended in the practice guideline. This suggests that the external environment may have a greater impact on physician behavior and length of stay than the practice guide itself. It also demonstrates the importance of continuous evaluation of physician practice immediately before, during, and after the implementation of clinical practice guidelines.",0,0,
69,protocol for the pharmacological treatment of major depression. Field testing of a potential prototype,"BACKGROUND: Much attention is paid to the development of clinical practice guidelines for the management of mental health disorders. The aim of this study was to field test a prototype protocol for the pharmacological treatment of Major Depression. METHODS: The protocol consisted of four to six-week treatment phases with critical choices in therapy defined by MADRS (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale) scores. Observational data collected on the behavior of the protocol in terms of relevance, acceptability, ease of use, and efficacy. RESULTS: The efficacy of the protocol was good for patients who stayed within and three-quarters achieved remission. However, more than half of all patients dropped out of absenteeism, and the most common reasons for this were adverse events. CONCLUSION: The protocol for the treatment of Major Depression seemed relevant, easy to use, and potentially effective. LIMITATION: Issues of non-compliance by both physicians and patients posed major challenges in the design of the protocol. Such difficulties illustrate the need to field-test any proposed design, as biases regarding the performance of a protocol can be misplaced. CLINICAL FITNESS: The tested protocol represents progress towards the goal of developing optimal strategies for the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents in the treatment of depression.",0,0,
70,Qualitative Assessment of Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist in Hospitals in England: Lessons from the Surgical Checklist Implementation Project,"Objectives: To assess how the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist is implemented in UK hospitals""; to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation; and more generally to draw lessons for the implementation of surgery/healthcare improvement initiatives. Background: WHO checklist, has been associated with improved surgical outcomes and teamwork, but we know little about factors influencing successful recruitment Methods: A longitudinal interview study was conducted with operating room staff on a representative sample of 10 UK hospitals between March 2010 and March 2011. Interviews were audio recorded by telephone The interviewees were asked about their experience with how the checklist was presented and the factors that hindered or helped this process. Transcripts were sent for thematic analysis. Results: A total of 119 interviews were completed. Checklist implementation was between and within hospitals. e varied widely, from preplanned/staged approaches to simply ""displaying"" the checklist in ORs, or for staff to feel it was imposed. Most barriers to implementation were specific to the checklist itself (for example, perceived design issues) but also included problematic integration into pre-existing processes. The most common obstacle was the resistance of senior clinicians. The facilitators outlined some positive steps that can be taken to avoid/address these barriers, such as changing the checklist, providing education/training, feeding back local data, fostering strong leadership (especially at the level of participation) and promoting accountability. Conclusions: We identified common themes that helped or hindered the introduction of the WHO checklist in the UK and translated them into recommendations to guide the implementation of remediation initiatives in surgery and the wider healthcare system.",0,1,
71,qualitative study to understand the non-guided use of imaging to stage prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: Approximately half of veterans with low-risk prostate cancer receive imaging that does not comply with the guideline. Our aim was to (1) compare physician knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding the use of imaging to stage prostate cancer, (2) patient attitudes and behaviors regarding imaging use, and (3) responses across three different responses. VA medical centers (VAMCs). METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to explore patient and provider knowledge and behavior regarding imaging use. Between September 2014 and July 2015, we conducted a total of 39 semi-structured interviews, 22 interviews with patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and 17 interviews with their caregivers, at three VAMCs representing the spectrum of inappropriate screening rates. After the key theoretical concepts were defined, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was chosen to explore the connections between the themes in the dataset and the existing domains within the framework. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and then coded and analyzed using Nvivo software. RESULTS: Themes from patient interviews were categorized into four TDF domains. Patients reported little interest in staging compared to disease treatment (targets), and many could not remember whether they had imaging (information). Patients tended to trust their doctors to make decisions about appropriate tests (beliefs about abilities). Some patients expressed minor concern about radiation exposure, but concern about cancer outcomes outweighed these fears (emotions). Themes from the doctor interviews were categorized into five TDF domains. Most physicians self-reported that they knew and trusted imaging guidelines (knowledge), but some still followed their own intuition due to clinical suspicion or years of experience (beliefs about abilities). Additionally, physicians reported that forensic concerns, fear of missing associated diagnoses (beliefs about outcomes), influence of frequently viewed colleagues (social influences), and viewing rates (environmental context) of the facility they practiced. CONCLUSIONS: Interviews with patients and physicians suggest that physicians are the primary (and in some cases only) decision makers in staging imaging for prostate cancer. This finding suggests that a physician-targeted intervention may be the most effective strategy to improve guideline-compliant prostate cancer imaging.",0,0,
72,quality improvement intervention that addresses provider behavior as it relates to the use of CA-MRSA guidelines,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a provider-focused quality improvement education intervention on appropriate prescribing for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. BACKGROUND: Patient, provider, and healthcare system factors contribute to appropriate antibiotic prescription. Ensuring appropriate prescribing is critical in reducing the burden of antibiotic resistance. Appropriate prescribing knowledge for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is the first step in shifting prescriber behavior to evidence-based recommendations. DESIGN: Quality Improvement Project. METHODS: After reviewing the best practice guidelines and implementing the Stitler Research Usage model, a short educational intervention was conducted using audio over PowerPoint. Items in the educational intervention included screening indications that focused specifically on the watch-and-wait role after culturing for simple abscesses. The intervention was administered in a non-profit, non-academic, emergency care setting, and the knowledge and practice of prescribing providers were evaluated. RESULTS: Eighteen (37.5%) of 48 medical doctors, physician assistants, and general nurse providers agreed"";"" Twelve (67%) of 18 participants showed increased knowledge. Forty-three percent of prescriber charts demonstrated improved practice through the use of guidelines. Of the 18 prescribers, 44% sent a total of 21 cultures for abscess. There was no difference in practice behaviors between occupational groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in knowledge scores, this improvement in knowledge did not turn into a dramatic change in practice, although positive trends were recorded. SUITABLE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: This quality improvement project highlights the complexity of changing prescriber behavior and the need for ongoing interventions.",0,0,
73,quantitative method for evaluating prescribing patterns using electronic health records.,"BACKGROUND: Most quality indicators available for hospitals are represented by simple ratios or ratios and are limited to specific events. A generalized method applicable to various clinical events has not been developed. The aim of this study was to develop a simple method for assessing physicians' prescribing patterns for various events and their awareness of clinical practice guidelines. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a quantitative method called the Prescription Model in the Clinical Event Environment (PACE) that can be applied to electronic health records (EHRs). Three distinct prescription patterns (intervention, maintenance, and discontinuation) were determined based on the prescription change index (PCI), calculated by the increase or decrease in the prescribing rate after a clinical event. Hyperkalemia and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) were used as exemplary cases. We calculated the PCIs of 10 drugs related to hyperkalemia, categorized them by prescription patterns, and then compared the resulting prescription patterns to known standards for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia was estimated using a questionnaire and compared with prescription pattern. CDAD prescriptions were also determined and compared with clinical knowledge. Clinical data of 1698, 348 and 1288 patients were collected from EHR data. Prescribing physicians for hyperkalemia and CDAD were in agreement with standard information. Prescription patterns correlated well with individual physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia (kappa = 0.714). Prescribing behaviors according to event severity or clinical situation were plotted as a simple summary graph. CONCLUSION: The algorithm successfully evaluated prescribing patterns from EHR data. Prescription patterns correlated well with physicians' knowledge. We expect this algorithm to enable the quantitative determination of prescribers' adherence to clinical guidelines and be used to facilitate improved prescribing practices.",0,0,
74,"Randomized Clinical Study of an Adapted Lifestyle Intervention for Obese, Sedentary, Primary Care Patients","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to test a specific lifestyle intervention to help obese primary care patients lose weight and increase their physical activity. METHODS: We conducted a 24-month randomized clinical trial in Rhode Island. Primary care physicians identified obese, sedentary patients who were motivated to lose weight and increase their moderate to vigorous physical activity. These patients were randomized to one of 2 experimental groups: advanced intervention (EI) or standard intervention (SI). Both groups received 3 face-to-face weight loss meetings. The advanced intervention group was also given telephone counseling sessions, individually tailored printed materials, and DVDs focusing on diet and physical activity. Active intervention took place at year 1 and in a reduced maintenance phase at year 2. 79% of the participants were women and 16% were minorities. They averaged 48.6 years of age with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 37.8 kg/m(2) and 21.2 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. Significantly more EI participants lost 5% of their baseline weights than SI participants (group by visit, P < .001). The difference was significant at 6 months (12.9% SI vs 37.2% EI) and 12 months (47.8% vs 11.6%) during active treatment, but was no longer significant in the maintenance phase at 18 months (31.4% vs. 26.7%). or 24 months (33.3% vs. 24.6%). The EI group reported significantly more minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity over time than the SI group (group at visit, P = 0.04). Differences in minutes per week at 6 months were 95.7 minutes for the EI group and 68.3 minutes for the SI group""; 73.7 versus 126.1 at 12 months;"" At 18 months, 103.7 vs. 63.7 and at 24 months, 101.3 vs. 75.4. Similar trends were found for the percentage reaching national guidelines for absolute weight loss and physical activity. CONCLUSION: A home-based, tailored lifestyle intervention was effective in promoting weight loss and increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity in obese, sedentary primary care patients, with effects peaking at 12 months but diminishing at 24 months.",0,0,
75,randomized controlled trial of a drug use review intervention for sedative hypnotic drugs.,"OBJECTIVES: The review of drug use is used by both the public and private sectors to influence prescribing behavior and patient drug use. The results of past interventions sent to prescribers have been mixed. The aim was to evaluate the effect of a one-time, mail-in intervention on subsequent use of sedative hypnotic medication. METHODS: An experimental design was used. The intervention included guidelines for the use of sedative hypnotics, a prescriber profile detailing the prescribing of sedative hypnotics, and a patient profile. Clustering of patients and co-prescribers was done to avoid contamination bias and statistical problems associated with non-independent observations. Subjects were 189 Washington State Medicaid recipients who took at least one sedative hypnotic drug tablet daily for 1 year and their prescribing physician or pharmacy dispensing drug (when information about the physician was missing). RESULTS: A significant reduction in the use of targeted sedative hypnotic drugs was measured in the intervention group (-27.6%) versus the control group (-8.5%). In the intervention group, 9.4% of patients started a new prescription for a benzodiazepine not targeted by the drug use review, while no control patients had new off-target benzodiazepine use. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention produced a statistically significant reduction in targeted drug use, and the amount of reduction is likely to have reduced the risk of fractures associated with benzodiazepine use. This study adds to recent evidence that mail-in medication use review interventions can have a desirable effect on patient medication use.",0,0,
76,randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive lifestyle management intervention (ELMI) following cardiac rehabilitation: study design and baseline data.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) represent comprehensive interventions typically limited to four months. It appears that risk factors and lifestyle behaviors may deteriorate after CRP is completed. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial after Comprehensive Lifestyle Management Intervention (ELMI) will explore the benefits of a randomized intervention to prevent these adverse changes. METHODS: Patients with ischemic heart disease (IRD) were randomized to ELMI or usual care following a standard CRP. The ELMI program is a case-managed intervention that aims to individualize risk factor and lifestyle management based on current treatment guidelines. The program consists of cardiac rehabilitation sessions, telephone follow-up and risk factor and lifestyle counseling sessions. Health professionals work with participants using behavioral counseling and communication with participants' family physicians. Ordinary care participants return to their family doctor's care and come to the study clinic only to undergo an annual outcome assessment. The primary outcome is the change in global risk of IHD after four years. Secondary outcomes include combined cardiovascular events, healthcare use, lifestyle adherence, quality of life, and risk factors. RESULTS: 302 men and women were randomized over 28 months. This represented 29% of the total population screened. The mean age of the study participants was 64, 18% were female, 53% had a previous myocardial infarction, 73% had previous revascularization, and 20% had diabetes mellitus. The ischemic heart disease risk factors for the entire cohort were significantly improved after subjects went through previous CRPs. Major risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, and medications were similar between groups. RESULTS: This study population represents patients who have completed a standard CRP. The results of the ELMI trial will provide valuable information for the future design of CRPs.",0,0,
77,Randomized Controlled Trial of IVR-Based Alcohol Brief Intervention to Promote Patient-Provider Communication in Primary Care,"BACKGROUND: Brief interventions for unhealthy drinking in primary care are effective but underused. Efforts to improve short response rates through provider training and redesign of office systems have had limited impact. Our new brief intervention uses interactive voice response (IVR) to provide information and advice directly to unhealthy drinkers prior to a doctor's office visit, with the aims of promoting in-office dialogue about drinking and reducing unhealthy drinking. This automated approach is potentially scalable for broad application. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the impact of the pre-visit IVR-provided brief alcohol intervention (IVR-BI) on patient-provider alcohol discussions during the visit. Design: This was a parallel group randomized controlled trial with two treatment arms: 1) IVR-BI or 2) usual care (no IVR-BI). PARTICIPANTS: In total, 1,567 patients were recruited from internal medicine and family medicine clinics affiliated with eight university medical centers. INTERVENTIONS: IVR-BI is a short automatic telephone intervention for alcohol. It has four components based on intervention steps outlined for clinicians in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines: 1) asking about alcohol use, 2) assessing alcohol use disorders, 3) advising the patient to stop or quit drinking, and 4) follow up at subsequent visits. . KEY MEASURES: Results reported by patient: patient-provider alcohol discussion at visit""; patient initiation of discussion;"" and the provider's advice regarding the patient's alcohol use. KEY RESULTS: Patients randomized to IVR-BI were more likely to report talking about alcohol with their provider (52% vs. 44%, p = 0.003), bringing it up themselves (12% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) and get a recommendation (14% versus 20%, p < 0.001). Other predictors of outcome included baseline consumption, education, age, and alcohol use disorder diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Providing automated brief interventions to patients prior to the primary care visit encourages discussion about unhealthy drinking and increases specific professional advice on changing drinking behavior.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Central Kentucky area in and around Louisville. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four pediatricians in clinical practice. interventions. A distance education program for pediatric asthma consisting of Web or CD-ROM based multimedia learning modules and two teleconference calls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Student satisfaction and change in physician asthma knowledge, attitudes, and treatment behavior at 1 to 4 months (short-term) and 6 to 8 months (long-term). RESULTS: Pediatricians graduated from medical school an average of 11.6 years ago (SD +/-8.9)"";"" 56% were women. On all student satisfaction items, the average score on a 5-point scale was 4.0 or higher, indicating a positive response from participants. Participants in the training group reported greater familiarity with asthma guidelines for prescribing daily inhaled corticosteroids compared to control physicians at short-term follow-up (p = .03). Participants also expressed increased confidence in drug selection for patients requiring low-dose inhaled steroids (p = .03). However, these differences were not seen in long-term follow-up. Compared with the control group, there was no significant increase in the proportion of patients receiving inhaled steroids for persistent asthma at short or long-term follow-up. RESULTS: Pediatricians using an asthma distance learning program expressed a high degree of student satisfaction. The program was associated with a temporary increase in familiarity and confidence in implementing components of asthma guidelines.",0,0,
79,randomized controlled trial to improve lymph node assessment in stage II colon cancer.,"HYPOTHESIS: Doctors seem to learn best from their peers, but the influence of opinion leaders on physician behavior is unclear. Because colon cancer staging is defined as inadequate in Ontario, Canada, we sought to evaluate the impact of colon cancer expert and local opinion leaders on optimizing colon cancer lymph node assessment. DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT, PARTICIPANTS: A cluster-randomized study of all hospitals in Ontario who identified a local opinion leader by intervention between January 5 and June 17, 2004. An opinion leader who specializes in colon cancer. The 21 response hospitals also received academic elaboration and a toolkit on a local opinion leader by an expert opinion leader. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean number of lymph nodes evaluated in patients with stage II colon cancer and the proportion of cases staged with at least 12 lymph nodes before and after a standard course were evaluated. RESULTS: Patient demographics and tumor factors were similar in both groups before and after the standardized course. Lymph node assessment significantly improved (P < .001) after standardized coursework in intervention and control sites. No additional benefit of academic elaboration and provision of a toolkit in the intervention has been demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Personal information provided by a colon cancer expert opinion leader can promote performance on lymph node evaluation for colon cancer. Academic elaboration by a local opinion leader did not further improve lymph node evaluation.",0,0,
80,Randomized outpatient trial of a decision support information technology tool.,"Background Decision-support information technology is often adopted to improve clinical decision making, but is rarely rigorously evaluated. Congress mandated the consideration of Problem-Information Integrators (PKC Corp, Burlington, Vt), a proposed decision support tool for the Department of Defense's new health information network. Methods This was a randomized patient-level trial conducted in 2 military exercises. A total of 936 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 966 to usual care. Coupler was applied before routine outpatient visits. The primary outcome was quality of care as assessed by the total percentage of any of the 24 health care quality process measures (evidence-based care delivery opportunities) fulfilled. Secondary outcomes included medical resources consumed within 60 days of enrollment and patient and provider satisfaction. Outcomes There were 4639 healthcare opportunities (2374 in the Kupler group and 2265 in the usual care group), with no difference in the proportion of opportunities fulfilled (33.9% vs. 30.7%"";"" P = .12). Although there was a modest improvement in performance in screening/preventive measures, it was offset by lower performance in some acute care measures. Combiner patients used more lab and pharmacy resources than regular care patients (logarithmic mean difference, $71). There was no difference in patient satisfaction between the groups, and provider satisfaction was mixed. Conclusion This study does not provide strong evidence to support the usefulness of this decision support tool, but demonstrates the value of rigorous evaluation of decision support information technology.",0,1,
81,"random attempt at ""result orders"" to avoid omission errors.","Purpose: Omission errors are a common cause of system failures. Doctors often fail to order tests or treatments needed to monitor/improve the effects of other tests or treatments. The authors hypothesized that the automated, guideline-based reminders provided to physicians when writing instructions could mitigate these shortcomings. Design: The research was carried out in the general medicine inpatient ward of a state teaching hospital. Faculty and home workers from the Indiana University School of Medicine who used computer workstations to write orders were randomized to intervention and control groups. Intervention doctors typed orders for 1 out of 87 selected tests or treatments, while the computer suggested the natural orders needed to detect or ameliorate adverse reactions to trigger orders. Physicians can accept or reject these recommendations. Results: During the 6-month trial, 48 intervention physicians were provided with reminders about outcome orders and were withheld from 41 control physicians. Intervention doctors ordered result orders recommended in 46.3% of cases when they received a reminder, while control doctors agreed in 21.9% (p < 0.0001). Doctors were discriminated against in accepting suggested orders, some readily accepted and others rejected. Interventions initiated by pharmacists along with doctors in the intervention were one-third less than in the control groups. Conclusion: This study shows that physician workstations linked to a comprehensive electronic medical record can be an effective tool to reduce errors of omission and improve adherence to practice guidelines.",1,1,
82,randomized trial of a computer-based intervention to reduce the use of unnecessary laboratory tests.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of giving physicians computerized reminders about seemingly unnecessary clinical laboratory tests. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial involving all patients hospitalized in a large teaching hospital over a 15-week period. The intervention consisted of computerized reminders when a seemingly unnecessary test was ordered. The main outcome measures were the proportion of clinical laboratory orders canceled and the proportion of tests actually performed. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 939 apparently unnecessary laboratory tests among the 77,609 study tests ranked between the intervention (n = 5,700 patients) and control (n = 5,886 patients) groups. In the intervention group, 69% of the tests (300 out of 437) were canceled in response to reminders. Of the 137 overrides, 41% were justified by table review. In the control group, 51% of sequential redundancy tests were performed, while in the intervention group only 27% of sequential redundancy tests were performed (P < 0.001). However, the estimated annual savings in lab fees were only $35,000. This was because only 44% of the redundant tests performed were computer orders, only half of the computer orders were scanned for redundancy, and almost a third of the reminders were invalidated. RESULTS: Reminders about apparently unnecessary lab testing orders were effective when delivered. However, the overall effect was limited because many tests were performed without corresponding computer orders and many orders were not screened for redundancy.",1,1,
83,randomized trial of computer-based reminders and supervision and feedback to improve HIV screening in primary care.,"Despite recommendations for voluntary HIV screening, few medical centers have implemented screening programs. The aim of the study was to determine whether an intervention with computer-based reminders and feedback would increase HIV screening in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system. The design of the study was a randomized controlled trial in five primary care clinics at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. All primary care providers were eligible to participate in the study. Study interventions were computer-based reminders to either assess HIV risk behaviors or recommend HIV testing""; feedback on adherence to reminders was provided. The main outcome measure was the difference in HIV testing rates between intervention and control providers. Control group providers, pre-intervention and during the intervention period tested 1.0% (n = 67) and 1.4% (n = 106) of patients, respectively, with intervention providers 1.8% (n = 98) and 1.9% (n = 114) tested (P = 0.75). In our random sample of 753 untested patients, 204 (27%) had documented risky behaviors Providers were more likely to adhere to reminders to test rather than reminders to assess risk (11% vs. 5%, P < 0.01). Sixty-one percent of providers felt that the lack of time impeded risk assessment.As a result, HIV testing rates in primary care clinics in our setting were low. They were unaware of the high-risk behavior rates in their patient population and perceived significant barriers to testing. Low-intensity clinical reminders and feedback did not increase screening rates.",0,1,
84,randomized trial of computerized reminders for blood pressure screening in primary care.,"In a randomized, controlled study (N = 8,298) the authors compared three ways to encourage patients in a large family practice to have their blood pressure checked.

85,randomized trial of electronic clinical reminders to improve quality of care for diabetes and coronary artery disease.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an integrated patient-specific electronic clinical reminder system on diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) care and to evaluate physician attitudes towards this reminder system. Design: We enrolled 194 primary care physicians caring for 4549 patients with diabetes and 2199 patients with CAD in 20 outpatient clinics. Clinics were randomized that physicians receive evidence-based electronic reminders in their patients' electronic medical records or usual care. There were five reminders for diabetes care and four reminders for CAD care. Measures: The primary outcome was receiving recommended care for diabetes and CAD. We generated a summary result to assess the likelihood of increased adherence to general diabetes care (based on five measures) and overall CAD care (based on four measures). We surveyed doctors to assess attitudes towards the reminder system. Results: Baseline adherence to all quality measures was low. Electronic reminders increased the likelihood of recommended diabetes care (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.67) and CAD (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01–1.55), while individual reminders were variable. A total of three nine reminders effectively increased rates of recommended care for diabetes or CAD. The majority of physicians (76%) thought that reminders improved the quality of care. Conclusion: An integrated electronic reminder system resulted in variable improvement in diabetes and CAD care. These improvements were generally limited and quality gaps remain.",1,1,
86,randomized trial of the efficacy of computer-triggered drug decision support versus on-demand drug in primary care.,"Objectives: Prescribing alerts generated by computerized drug decision support (CDDS) can prevent drug-related morbidity. However, the vast majority of warnings are ignored due to clinical irrelevance. The ability to customize commercial alert systems should improve physician acceptance, as the physician can choose the terms and types of drug warnings displayed. We tested the effectiveness of two approaches to customizing medication alerting to reduce the prevalence of prescribing problems: physician-requested and computer-triggered decision support. Doctors in each study condition were able to preset the levels that triggered the alerts. Design: This was a cluster trial for 3,449 patients seen over the next 6 months with 28 primary care physicians randomized to automated or on-demand CDDS in the MOXXI drug management system. Metrics: CDDS has created alerts to prescribe issues that can be customized by severity. Prescribing issues included dose errors, drug-drug, age, allergy, and disease interactions. Doctors randomized on demand enabled drug review when they thought it was clinically relevant, while physicians randomized to computer-triggered decision support displayed all alerts for electronic prescriptions based on their chosen severity level for both common and incident problems. Data from administrative requests and MOXXI were used to measure the difference in prevalence of prescribing problems at the end of follow-up. Results: During follow-up, 50% of physicians receiving computer-triggered alerts changed the alert threshold (n = 7) and 21% of doctors in the on-demand alert group changed the alert level (n = 3). In the optional group, 4,445 prescribing problems were detected, 41 (0.9%) problems were observed in the requested drug review, and prescriptions were revised in 31 (75.6%) problems. By comparison, out of 6,505 prescribing problems in the computer-triggered group, 668 (10.3%) were seen and 81 (12.1%) were revised. Most warnings were ignored because the benefit was judged to outweigh the risk, the interaction was known, or the interaction was not considered clinically significant (computer-triggered: 75.8% of 585 ignored warnings; optional: 90% of 10 ignored warnings warnings). At the end of follow-up, there was a significant reduction in therapeutic relapse problems in the computer-triggered group (odds ratio 0.55;"" p = 0.02) but no difference in the overall prevalence of prescribing problems. Outcome: customization of computer-triggered alert systems rather than on-demand review more useful in detecting and solving prescribing problems, but neither approach has been effective in reducing prescribing problems. New strategies are needed to maximize the use of drug decision support systems to reduce drug-related morbidity.",1,1,

88,real-world cascaded wedge cluster randomized practice facilitation trial to improve cardiovascular care,"BACKGROUND: Facilitation of administration has been associated with significant improvements in disease prevention and quality of patient care. Using facilitation of practice, the Improving Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project aimed to improve the delivery of evidence-based cardiovascular care in primary care settings in a broad health region. Our aim was to assess the impact of IDOCC on adherence to care delivery processes. METHODS: A pragmatic tiered cluster randomized trial recruiting primary care providers in practices located in Eastern Ontario, Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00574808). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three steps by region. Implementation facilitators were intended to visit practices every 3-4 (year 1 intensive) or 6-12 weeks (year 2 sustainability) to support changes in practice behavior. The primary outcome was average adherence to evidence-based care indicators measured at the patient level. Compliance was assessed by chart review of a cohort of 66 randomly selected patients per treatment at each pre-intervention year, as well as at 1 and 2 years post-intervention. RESULTS: Eighty-four practices (182 physicians) participated. The facilitators made an average of 6.6 (min: 2, max: 11) face-to-face visits in year 1 and 2.5 (min: 0 max: 10) visits in year 2. We collected tabular data from 5292 patients. After adjusting for patient and provider characteristics, there was an absolute decrease in mean adherence of 1.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): -2.9 to -0.9%) and 4.2% (95% CI: -5.7 to -2.6%). The basis for years of intense and sustainability, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: IDOCC did not improve compliance with best practice guidelines. Our results showed a small statistically significant decrease in mean agreement of questionable clinical significance. Possible reasons for this outcome include implementation difficulties, competing priorities in implementation, a broad focus on multiple chronic disease indicators, and the use of an overall compliance index. These results contradict findings from previously reported facilitation trials and highlight the complexities and challenges of translating research findings into clinical practice.

89,Research Agenda for High Value Palliative Care,"Palliative care has gone from being misunderstood and overlooked by many clinicians to become one of the most sought after services by healthcare systems nationwide. This is the greatest possible proof of the potential value of space. However, the field's ability to sustainably provide high-value care is paradoxically threatened by its own success, as demand rapidly outpaces the supply of palliative care professionals (1). To bridge the gap between workforce and patient need, we propose a research agenda organized around 5 key questions about the optimal organization and allocation of limited resources in private palliative care. The table presents key considerations and suggested approaches to addressing each research problem. Among the growing evidence for the potential value of private palliative care (2), we hypothesize that it is necessary to answer these questions in order to maximize value and inform much-needed policies to support this care (3).",0,0,

91,Review of family intervention guidelines for pediatric acquired brain injuries,"Pediatric acquired brain injury (BI) not only affects the injured child, but also greatly affects his family. Studies show that rates of caregiver and sibling psychological distress are higher after a child in the family maintains BI. Also, family functioning after BI affects the child's recovery. In reviewing the literature, we identified seven theoretical clinical guidelines for working with families of children and adolescents with BI. These clinical guidelines are: (1) select developmentally appropriate interventions, (2) match the intervention with the family, (3) provide advocacy, (4) provide injury education, (5) focus on family reorganization, (6) appropriately address the child's environment. and (7) provide skills training to the family and the child. Current research on family interventions for BI is reviewed in the context of these theoretical guidelines, and then empirical support for each guideline is evaluated using specific criteria for empirically supported treatments. Unfortunately, very few randomized controlled trials are available and continued research is needed to classify all clinical guidelines as ""effective"". Additionally, ongoing research will help inform experts about specific approaches to use when working with the family of a child with BI. Currently, clinicians and researchers can turn to existing clinical guidelines to help address the myriad of barriers that come with practicing and examining family interventions for pediatric BI.",0,0,
92,review of quantitative studies of adherence to mental health clinical practice guidelines,"Mental health clinical practice guidelines have proliferated, but there is little evidence of the extent to which they are actually applied in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to find and review all peer-reviewed reports published up to 2000 that provided quantitative information on rates of adherence to specific mental health guidelines. A literature review yielded 41 related studies. These studies were of three types: 26 were cross-sectional studies conducted after the publication of the guidelines, six were conducted without any specific intervention (pre/post) before and after the publication of the guidelines, and nine included a controlled trial of a specific intervention. Only 37% were conducted in the mental health specialty sector. Adequate agreement was found in 27% of cross-sectional and before/after studies and 67% of controlled studies. Successful interventions tended to be complex, involving system redesign or additional resources. Of the 13 studies that also measured patient outcome, only six (46%) found that better outcome was associated with greater guideline adherence. Several studies have shown that after interventions were discontinued, compliance rates returned to pre-intervention levels. Thus, the evidence suggests that adherence to the guideline is not high without the specific intervention, but that specific interventions (typically those that are versatile and resource-intensive) improve compliance. However, the public health challenge is to design and implement interventions that are sustainable in general clinical practice.",0,0,
93,review of the evidence for poor adherence by healthcare practitioners to standard/universal infection control measures,"OBJECTIVES: Drawing on international research, the review examines: the extent to which practitioners adhere to infection control measures; relevant issues considered to be effective in compliance; what strategies have been evaluated to promote positive behavior changes among practitioners and the impact of these interventions. BACKGROUND: Internationally, standard/universal precautions (UPs) are considered fundamental to infection prevention and control and are effective in protecting practitioners and patients. However, compliance has been problematic and implementation of standard/IPs is sub-optimal globally. METHODS: Literature search using various electronic databases from 1994 to 2006, where relevant evidence was defined by the number of key terms used. Data were extracted using key headings that facilitated analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were evaluated. Twenty-four related to measuring practitioner compliance and t' 13 studies evaluating the effect of a research intervention on compliance. In addition, other studies examining specific causes of suboptimal compliance or discussing infection control measures in general are included. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with infection control measures is below optimal at the international level. Evidence confirms that compliance with certain aspects of the standard/IPs varies and practitioners are selective in applying recommended practices. Adaptation improves following a structured intervention,"" but research fails to show how long the intervention affects practitioner compliance, or whether compliance returns to the norm after a period of time. Various causes of non-compliance are discussed and recommendations for the future Relevance for clinical practice Sub-optimal compliance staff safety, patient protection Infection control teams and researchers should consider the causes of non-compliance and provide a supportive environment that assists the routine, long-term application of standard precautions.",0,1,
94,review of the literature on remote monitoring technology in incentive-based interventions for health-related behavior change.,"The use of technology (eg, Internet, mobile phones) is increasing to allow remote delivery of incentive interventions for health-related behavior change. To our knowledge, a systematic review of this reported literature has not yet been conducted. This report presents a systematic review of controlled trials using technology to remotely administer financial incentive interventions targeting substance use and other health behaviors published between 2004 and 2015. Alone or in combination of the following 2 objectives: (a) to monitor target behavior or (b) to provide incentives to achieve the target target. Studies also examine financial incentives (e.g., cash, coupons) for health-related behavior change, peer-reviewed publication, and the effectiveness of the incentive intervention into another situation (e.g., unconditional incentives, treat-as-usual). Of the 39 reports that met the inclusion criteria, 18 were targeted substance use, 10 targeted drug adherence or home health monitoring, and 11 targeted diet, exercise, or weight loss. All 39 (100%) studies used technology to facilitate remote monitoring of target behavior, and 26 (66.7%) studies incorporated technology into the remote delivery of incentives. Statistically significant intervention effects were reported in 71% of the studies reviewed. Overall, the results provide substantial support for the effectiveness of remotely administered incentive interventions for health-related behavior change, which have the potential to increase the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of this treatment approach.

95,review of the use of laboratory testing: A trigger for cost reduction and quality improvement in healthcare,"BACKGROUND: Considering the role of laboratory testing as a central part of controlling healthcare expenditure, this study aims to explore the overuse of laboratory testing in Iran to pave the way for future interventions. METHODS: Inappropriate laboratory use was reviewed in a cross-sectional questionnaire through retrospective analysis of 384 medical records at a tertiary center. To pave the way for future intervention, overuse tests were divided into two categories, inappropriate and ineffective, and then analyzed. Frequency analysis was used to analyze the patient's age, gender, length of hospital stay, length of stay and diagnosis, as well as inappropriate testing and inefficient testing. RESULTS: A total of 143 (1.50%) of the tests were inefficient and were ordered due to laboratory errors such as hemolysis, insufficient sampling or absurd results. Of the tests, 2522 (26.40%) were ineligible and resulted from not meeting the medical/clinical eligibility criteria. CONCLUSION: Although inappropriate test sequencing is more frequent than inefficient testing, initial remediation strategy should focus on physicians' test ordering behavior through appropriate teaching strategies, continuous supervision and training feedback, application of health information technology tools, and application of laboratory practice guidelines (LPGs). . ) and test algorithms. For inefficient testing, it is recommended to conduct a cycle of continuous quality improvement for laboratory services and to train personnel involved in blood sampling.",0,0,
96,simple intervention to improve hospital antibiotic prescription,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in prescribing behavior after distribution of antibiotic guides printed on 9 x 6 cm laminated card suitable for affixing to a hospital ID card. INTERVENTION: Guidelines for appropriate antibiotic prescription for 20 common and important pediatric infections were printed on a laminated 9 x 6 cm laminated card suitable for clip-on hospital ID card and distributed to all healthcare personnel. DESIGN: We collected data from medical records for three marker conditions (tonsillitis, pneumonia, and orbital/periorbital cellulitis) in patient samples from six-month periods on either side of the month in which the cards were distributed. The prescribers were unaware of the study, and the investigators analyzed the prescriptions without knowledge of the period in which they were written. Prescriptions were graded according to appropriate antibiotic and appropriate dose selection. Data on antibiotic costs were also collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ""Proportion of cases where antibiotic choice is appropriate""; proportion of cases where antibiotic dosing is appropriate; annual costs of third-generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: Little change in prescribing practice after the introduction of cards for tonsillitis. For pneumonia, cases with appropriate choice 77% and increased appropriate dose from 48% to 81% (P = 0.001) For orbital/periorbital cellulitis, suitably selected cases increased from 19% to 78% ( P < 0.001) and appropriate dose cases increased from 30% to 51% (P = 0.11) Third generation cephalosporins had annual costs of $193,245 for pre-cards and $89,814 for postcards.

97,simple way to improve DVT protocol compatibility,"Objective: To evaluate the effect on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) protocol violations of applying a label attached to the patient's medication schedule, specifically allowing appropriate prescribing of low-dose subcutaneous heparin or thromboembolic stockings (TEDS). Design: An audit study. Setting: General Surgery Department of a District General Hospital in the UK. Method: All adult general surgery patients hospitalized on weekdays were examined. Staff were not warned about the work in advance. Patient details and risk factors for DVT were noted. Details of the DVT prophylaxis administered were recorded. In total, four separate studies were conducted: with the original protocols (I), after 1 and 3 years with the refined protocol (II, III), and finally after the introduction of the label (IV). Results: Protocol violations were defined as ""acceptable"" or ""unacceptable"". Raising awareness between Study I and II reduced acceptable violations to zero. There was no statistically significant reduction in unacceptable violations (24.1"" in 80 patients; 17 in 75, II;""13 in 60, III). In Study IV, 51 patients had only 6 violations after label introduction (p<0.02).

98,"snapshot of general practitioner attitudes, confidence levels, and self-reported pediatric asthma management practice","The prevalence of asthma is high in Australia. Previous findings have suggested that asthma management has been inadequate, particularly in primary care, and recent government attempts to improve asthma management and encourage the use of written asthma action plans (WAAPs) in general practice have been implemented. We aimed to evaluate the attitudes, confidence and self-reported practice of pediatric asthma management of a suitable sample of Australian general practitioners (GPs). A basic questionnaire was administered to GPs as part of a randomized controlled trial. General practitioners (GPs) were recruited from two areas of the Sydney metropolitan area, NSW, between 2006 and 2008. Invitations were sent to an estimated 1200 potential eligible GPs. Of the 150 (12.5%) registered general practitioners, 122 (10.2%) completed the basic questionnaire. Although 89% were aware of the Australian National Asthma Guidelines, less than 40% were familiar with the guideline recommendations. While 85.2% of them had a positive attitude towards WAAPs, only 45.1% reported that they provided them frequently. For children with frequent symptoms, 90% agreed that they should be prescribed daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and 83% reported that they currently prescribe ICS to such patients. These findings illustrate gaps between GP attitudes and behaviors and highlight opportunities for intervention to improve pediatric asthma management.",0,0,
99,statewide controlled trial intervention to reduce the use of unproven or ineffective breast cancer treatment,"BACKGROUND: Challenged by the public, colleagues, and the Congressional Budget Office, medical specialty associations have begun to develop a ""Top Five"" list of expensive procedures that do not provide meaningful benefits, at least to some categories of patients for which they are generally ordered. However, it is unknown to what extent these lists affect the behavior of doctors or patients. METHODS: We are partnering with a statewide health systems consortium to examine the effectiveness of two interventions: (i) ""basic"" public reporting and (ii) an ""advanced"" intervention that increases public reporting with a smartphone-based app that provides information to providers. Just-in-time information, decision-making tools, and personalized patient education materials to support reductions in the use of eight breast cancer interventions targeted by Choosing Wisely(R) or oncology community guidelines. Our objectives are: (1) to examine whether basic public reporting reduces the use of targeted breast cancer practices in a contemporary cohort of patients with breast cancer cases in the intervention versus usual care setting in comparison situations; (2) to examine the efficacy of an enhanced intervention relative to the baseline intervention; and (3) simulating the cost savings resulting from the nationwide implementation of both interventions. DISCUSSION: The results will provide conclusive evidence of the effectiveness of a unique public reporting system that pays all ages to influence provider behavior that can easily be exported to other states and potentially major health systems. The findings will be more relevant to the ACO environment, which is expected to provide financial disincentives for ineffective or unproven care.

100,Examining the factors associated with cost and diversity in prescribing among GPs.,"BACKGROUND: Improper prescribing has the potential to harm both the individual and society. Previous research has identified physician or demographic characteristics that influence prescribing variation but cannot be changed. OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable factors associated with GP prescribing variance and cost. METHODS: Qualitative research methods were used in semi-structured taped interviews with 17 GPs in Avon, South West NHS Region, England. CONCLUSIONS: GPs viewed themselves as cautious and conservative prescribers. Prescribing decisions were often justified by the prescriber, despite conflicting clinical or cost arguments. A personally developed drug formulation was used to reduce the dilemmas potentially associated with prescribing uncertainty. The willingness to reflect on and measure prescribing habits according to established professional standards varied significantly. The absence of mechanisms for monitoring prescribing decisions, combined with the inadequate use of the community pharmacist, has resulted in ambiguous prescribing results. Some GPs have had a hard time keeping up to date professionally due to perceived time constraints. Excessive patient demand was thought to affect their prescribing, but GPs stated that they were not unduly influenced by the drug representative. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing has a significant impact on health and budgets and still remains a controversial issue. Improved partnerships should be established between patient, doctor and pharmacist. Support through better prescribing decision monitoring and policy development and educational intervention is needed to reduce prescribing uncertainty. Newly established Primary Care Groups may need to reflect on the challenges faced by prescribers, particularly when prescribing within cash-limited budgets, to avoid mismatch between prescribing behavior and local policy development.",0,0,
101,Successful experiment to reduce unnecessary laboratory use in a public hospital,"series of interventions at a 228-bed general hospital provided doctors with periodic feedback on the amount of laboratory services used to treat their patients. Laboratory test estimates adjusted for case mix allowed each doctor to compare the use of laboratory tests with that of their colleagues in the same department in the same hospital. Doctors with ""extreme"" practice patterns ordered hundreds of more lab tests than average each year. A well-rounded training program included: 1) meetings were held about costs and unnecessary laboratory testing""; 2) physicians were given explanations of practice patterns relative to colleagues as part of both large and small departmental discussions; 3) feedback was repeated one year later; 4 ) a consensus conference created guidelines for test ordering;"" and 5) a patient record sample was reviewed for compliance with the laboratory test order. A total of 37% of a test sample ordered at baseline by physicians with ""extreme"" administration patterns was classified as inappropriate. The intervention resulted in a reduction of 1.8 tests per patient (P = 0.0005). Eight of the nine tests individually showed reductions in use. Pay data from the destination hospital showed a statistically significant decrease in laboratory fees per patient in the quarter after program start (P = 0.02) and no evidence for change in a group of five comparison hospitals. There was no evidence of a reduction in the ranking of the baseline tests. These results demonstrate a cost-effective approach to reducing unnecessary costs that can be implemented in hospitals with integrated data systems.",0,1,
102,"survey of tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers in Mississippi.","RATIONALE: Compared to other regions in the USA, the prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related disease is high in Mississippi. This study evaluated tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors of family physicians, dentists, and nurses in the state of Mississippi. METHODS: The Provider Attitude Questionnaire, an 85-item measure of tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors, was mailed to all members of Mississippi's Family Medicine, Dentistry, and Nursing professional organizations (N=2043). RESULTS: More than one-third of eligible providers (n=802, 39.2%) responded. Only 24.3% had received training in tobacco cessation and 33.7% were aware of the Public Health Service clinical practice guidelines. More than 90% said their role was to prevent tobacco use""; they felt rewarded for helping patients quit;"" and was disturbed and upset by the health effects of tobacco. Doctors helped more patients than nurses or dentists. Doctors and nurses reported greater self-efficacy, motivation, and readiness to treat tobacco use than dentists. Providers who received training performed more interventions and reported greater self-efficacy, preparedness, and fewer barriers than those who did not. Education was associated with greater increases in self-efficacy, preparedness and intervention behaviors for dentists than for other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases in Mississippi, primary healthcare providers in Mississippi provide unacceptably low frequency of tobacco cessation interventions compared to other regions. Education is likely to increase the frequency of intervention behaviors.",0,0,
103,sustainable strategy to prevent misuse of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections,"More than 50% of past antibiotic prescriptions are for outpatients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI). Many are not needed and thus contribute to both preventable adverse events and pressures to develop bacterial resistance. Can an intervening clinical decision support system (CDSS) during electronic prescribing adjust antibiotic use according to consensus treatment guidelines for ARI? Methods This is a retrospective comparison of the pre-intervention (2002) and post-intervention (2003-2006) periods in two comprehensive health systems (intervention and control). The intervention was a CDSS targeting fluoroquinolone and azithromycin""; other antibiotics remained unrestricted. 7000 outpatient visits marked by an ARI case finding algorithm were reviewed for compliance with guidelines (antibiotic prescribed or not prescribed when warranted or not prescribed) Results 3831 patients met the case definitions for one or more ARI: pneumonia (537), bronchitis (2931), sinusitis (717), and nonspecific ARI (145) All patients with pneumonia were given antibiotics. ) rate of compliant prescribing, intervention for antibiotics targeted by CDSS region was 2.57 (95% CI?=?(1.865 to 3,540);"" concordance was unchanged for other antibiotics (adjusted RR?=?1.18 (95%) CI=?(0.691 to 2.011))) Proportion of non-guaranteed prescriptions of targeted antibiotics decreased from 22% to 3% before and after intervention (p<0.0001).

104,systematic qualitative analysis of psychoeducational interventions for depression in cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVES/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether research-based recommendations can be made on the clinical management of depression in patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES: Reports of scientific studies, qualitative or quantitative systematic reviews of scientific studies, and practice guidelines published between 1980-2000. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 36 pieces of evidence supported the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions benefit depressive symptoms. Evidence included two well-conducted meta-analyses and nine well-designed randomized clinical trials with large samples (N > 100). Regarding intervention content, 70% of behavioral therapy studies and 66% of counseling studies produced results supporting the hypothesis. Additionally, 58% of studies that tested behavior therapy or counseling along with cancer education yielded positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions reduce depressive symptoms in cancer patients and that behavioral therapy or counseling, alone or in combination with cancer education, is beneficial.

105,systematic review of clinical decision support systems for antimicrobial management: Are we failing to research these interventions appropriately?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for antimicrobial management can support clinicians in optimizing antimicrobial therapy. We reviewed all of the original literature (qualitative and quantitative) to understand the current scope of CDSS for antimicrobial management and to analyze current methods used to evaluate and report such systems. METHOD: PRISMA instructions were followed. Medline, EMBASE, HMIC Health and Management, and Global Health databases were searched between January 1, 1980 and October 31, 2015. All primary research studies describing CDSS for antimicrobial management in adults in primary or secondary care were included. Thematic synthesis was made for qualitative research. Quality was assessed using the Integrated quality Criteria for Review of Multiple Study Designs (ICROMS) criteria. CDSS reporting was evaluated against a reporting framework for behavior change intervention implementation. RESULTS: 58 original articles describing 38 independent CDSSs were included. The majority of systems target antimicrobial prescribing (29/38%; 76%), are platforms integrated with electronic medical records (28/38%; 74%), and have a rules-based infrastructure that provides decision support (29/38;""76%). In the assessment made against the response reporting framework, CDSS studies do not report consideration of the non-specialist, end-user workflow. They have a narrow focus, such as antimicrobial selection, and use surrogate outcome measures. Participation by clinicians with CDSS was poor. CONCLUSION: When designing CDSS interventions, more consideration should be given to factors that drive non-expert decision making. Future work should aim to go beyond selecting appropriate antimicrobials with clear and systematic reporting frameworks for CDSS interventions developed to address current gaps identified in reporting evidence.",0,1,
106,systematic review of computer-based patient registry systems and quality of care: more randomized clinical trials or a broader approach?,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the impact of computer-based patient record systems (CBPRS) on medical practice, quality of care, and user and patient satisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Manual and electronic search of Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases. STUDY SELECTION: Selected articles published from 2000 to March 2003. CBPRS was defined as computer software designed for use by clinicians as a direct aid in clinical decision making. To be included, systems must record patient characteristics and provide online advice or specific information or reminders to clinicians during consultation. DATA DRAWING: The keywords used for the search were: electronic record, informatics record, electronic medical record, electronic patient record, patient order entry, computer-based patient system, clinical decision support systems, and evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were selected. The use of CBPRS was perceived positively by physicians, and satisfaction studies were mostly positive. In all three studies examining this criterion, the positive effect of CBPRS on preventive care was observed. Twelve studies evaluating the impact on medical practice and compliance with guidelines have shown that positive experiences are as frequent as experiences with no benefit. Of the six studies that analyzed the effect of CBPRS on patient outcomes, none reported any benefit. RESULTS: CBPRS has increased user and patient satisfaction, which can lead to significant improvements in medical care practice. However, studies of the impact of CBPRS on patient outcomes and quality of care are inconclusive. Alternative approaches that take into account social, cultural and organizational factors may be needed to evaluate the usefulness of CBRS.",0,0,

108,systematic review of faculty development initiatives designed to increase teaching effectiveness in medical education: BEME Guide No. 8,"BACKGROUND: Preparing health professionals for teaching is considered essential to increase teaching effectiveness. Although many reports describe a variety of faculty development interventions, there is little research demonstrating their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: ""What are the effects of faculty development interventions on teachers' knowledge, attitudes and skills in medical education, and on the institutions they work for?"" Synthesize the available evidence that answers the question. METHODS: The research covering the period 1980-2002 included three databases (Medline, ERIC, and EMBASE) and used the keywords: ""personnel development""; in-service training; medical school; faculty training/development; continuing medical education. Manual searches were also performed. Revised articles focusing on faculty development to increase teaching effectiveness aimed at basic and clinical scientists. All study designs that included outcome data beyond participant satisfaction were accepted. 53 articles from the first 2777 abstracts met review criteria. Data were six coders using the standard BEME coding sheet adapted for our use. Two reviewers coded each study, and coding differences were resolved through discussion. Data were synthesized using Kirkpatrick's four levels of educational outcomes. Findings were grouped by type of intervention and defined by level of outcome. In addition, 8 high-quality studies were 'focused'. picture' moment was analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the interventions were aimed at practicing clinicians. All of the reports focused on improving teaching and interventions included workshops, seminar series, short courses, longitudinal programs and 'other interventions'. Study designs included 6 randomized controlled trials and 47 quasi-experimental studies, of which 31 used a pretest-posttest design. KEY POINTS: Despite methodological limitations, the faculty development literature tends to support the following conclusions: Overall satisfaction with faculty development programs was high. Participants consistently found the programs acceptable, useful, and relevant. Participants reported positive changes in attitudes towards faculty development and teaching. Participants reported increased knowledge of educational principles and gains in teaching skills. Where formal tests of knowledge have been used, significant gains have been demonstrated. Changes in teaching behavior were consistently reported by participants and were also detected by students. Changes in organizational practice and student learning were often not explored. However, reported changes included greater educational participation and the establishment of university networks. Key features of effective faculty development that contribute to effectiveness include the use of experiential learning, providing feedback, effective peer and peer relationships, well-designed interventions that follow teaching and learning principles, and the use of a variety of educational methods within a single intervention. Methodological issues: More rigorous designs and greater use of qualitative and mixed methods are required to capture the complexity of interventions. Newer performance-based assessment methods using different data sources should be explored and reliable and valid outcome measures developed. Maintaining change over time should also be considered, as should process-oriented studies comparing different faculty development strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Faculty development activities seem highly valued by participants who also report changes in learning and behavior. Despite the methodological limitations in the literature, certain program features appear to be consistently associated with effectiveness. More research is needed to explore these relationships at the individual and institutional level and document the results.",0,0,
109,specific intervention to implement guideline recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care: a pragmatic cluster randomized trial.,"Background Elderly patients with depression are underdiagnosed, undertreated and at high risk of a chronic course. General practitioners follow clinical practice guidelines to a limited extent. In the Special Practice for Chronic Diseases International research project, we tested the effectiveness of specific interventions to improve the care of patients with chronic diseases. In Norway, we examined this approach to improve adherence to six guidelines for older patients with depression, targeting healthcare professionals, patients, and administrators. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized trial in 80 Norwegian municipalities. We identified implementation determinants for the six recommendations and then made tailored interventions to address these determinants. Interventions targeted health professionals, administrators, and patients and consisted of outreach visits, a website offering advice and underlying evidence, tools for managing depression in the elderly, and other web-based resources, including a continuing medical education course for general practitioners. The primary outcome was average adherence to recommendations. Secondary outcomes were improvement in depression symptoms as measured by patients and GPs. We offered outreach visits to all GPs and practice staff in the response municipalities. We used electronic software that extracts eligible patients from lists of general practitioners. We collected data by interviewing general practitioners or by sending a questionnaire to the four patients on their list about their practice and sending a questionnaire to the patients. Results One hundred and twenty-four (14%) of 900 GPs participated in data collection, 51 in the intervention group, and 73 in the control group. We interviewed 77 GPs, 47 GPs completed the questionnaire and 134 patients answered the questionnaire. Among GPs providing data, adherence to recommendations was 1.6 percentage points higher in the intervention group than in the control group (95% CI -6 to 9). Conclusions The effectiveness of our specific intervention to implement recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care is uncertain due to the low response rate in data collection. However, the effect is unlikely to be large. It remains unclear how best to improve adherence to evidence-based recommendations and thus improve the quality of care for these patients.

110,Teachable Moment Communication Process for a smoking cessation speech: a description of a group of randomized clinician-focused interventions.,"BACKGROUND: Effective clinician-patient communication about health behavior change is one of the most important and most overlooked strategies for promoting health and preventing disease. Existing guidelines for specific health behavior counseling have been established and published, but have not been successfully adopted in primary care practice. Building on studies focused on establishing effective clinician strategies to promote health behavior change in primary care, we developed an intervention aimed at improving clinician communication skills to create and act upon teachable moments for smoking cessation. In this article, we describe the key features of a group of randomized trials designed to evaluate the development and implementation and effectiveness of the Teachable Moment Communication Process (TMCP) intervention. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized group trial included thirty-one community-based primary care clinicians working in Northeast Ohio and 840 of their adult patients. Clinicians were randomly assigned to receive either the Teachable Moments Communication Process (TMCP) intervention for smoking cessation or the delayed intervention. The TMCP intervention consisted of two, 3-hour training sessions that included a didactic presentation, skill demonstration via video examples, skills practices with standard patients, and feedback from peers and instructors. For each registered clinician, 12 patients were recruited for the two time points. Pre- and post-intervention data were collected from clinicians, patients, and audio-recorded clinician-patient interactions. At baseline, the two clinician groups and their patients were similar in all demographics and practice characteristics studied. Both physician and patient recruitment targets were met and retention was 96% and 94%, respectively. DISCUSSION: Findings support the feasibility of training clinicians to use the Teachable Moments Communication Process. The next steps are to evaluate how well clinicians use these skills in their practice and the impact on patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01575886.",0,0,

112,International theory of bioethics: debatable and non-negotiable,"previous article in this issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal presents the argument that the position that international bioethics rests on ""fundamental"" or ""fundamental"" moral principles universally accepted in all ages and cultures collapses under ""moral fundamentalism."" various multicultural and postmodern critiques. This article looks at the contractual tradition of Hobbes and Locke - as reinterpreted by David Gauthier, Robert Nozick and John Rawls - as an alternative rationale for international bioethics. Drawing on the main themes of this tradition, it is argued that international bioethics can be rationally restructured as a negotiated moral order that respects cultural and individually defined areas of inconsistency. Moreover, a negotiated theory of moral order is consistent with traditional ideals of human rights, flexible enough to absorb genuine understandings of multiculturalism and postmodernism, and yet powerful enough to justify cross-cultural and trans-temporal moral judgments, including condemnation of the Nazi. Doctors in Nuremberg.

113,theory-based educational intervention targeting nurses' attitudes and knowledge regarding cancer-related pain management: a study protocol of a quasi-experimental design.,"OBJECTIVE: Pain is one of the most common problems in patients diagnosed with cancer. Despite the availability of effective pharmacological treatments, this group of patients often receive less than optimal treatment. Research on nurses' pain management highlights certain factors as common barriers to effective pain management, such as lack of knowledge and attitude and inadequate procedures for systematic pain assessment. However, educational interventions targeting nurses' pain management have shown promise. Further development of knowledge in this area is warranted, as cancer-related pain is known to have a negative impact on vital aspects of a patient's life and is also commonly associated with problems such as sleep, fatigue, depression, and anxiety. METHODS/DESIGN: A quasi-experimental study design will be used to explore whether the application of guidelines for systematic daily pain assessments following a theory-based educational intervention would result in an improvement in knowledge and attitude among nurses. Another aim is to investigate whether an intervention targeting nurses' behaviors will improve the pain perception of hospitalized patients. Data on nurses' knowledge and attitudes towards pain (primary outcome), patient perception of pain (secondary outcome), along with socio-demographic variables, will be collected at baseline and at four and 12 weeks following the intervention. DISCUSSION: Nursing care is recognized as an increasingly complex activity today, and ""the complexity of nursing is such that it can be seen as an intrinsically complex intervention."" Changing and improving clinical practice requires multiple points of attack suited to tackling complex challenges. In conclusion, we anticipate that the theory-based intervention used in our quasi-experimental study will improve care and quality of life for this patient group, as well as that evidence-based guidelines targeting the pain of this patient group will be more widely implemented.

114,Tool for Evaluating a Community's Substance Abuse Care Capacity,"Evidence-based programs for substance abuse prevention and intervention are increasing. Community needs assessments and health rankings provide definitions of local behavioral health needs, but do not provide guidance to public health practitioners and policy makers on the number of programs, health care practitioners, or interventions needed in the local substance abuse care system. This article provides a new framework for measuring and evaluating the substance abuse care system in a community. Evaluation can inform resource allocation across the continuum of care to distribute interventions and care more equitably and efficiently. We conducted 2 literature searches and synthesized our findings to create a community assessment methodology and needs calculator, CAST (computation for an adequate system tool). We reviewed 212 articles to generate an inventory of the community and social correlates of behavioral health, the components of a substance abuse care system, and the numeric values for guidelines for estimating community needs. CAST produces community-specific assessments of the capacity of the components of a community substance abuse care system. CAST generates recommendations by applying social and societal determinants of health as risk coefficients to each component need estimate. CAST can assist public health practitioners in assessing and developing the capacity of community-based, substance abuse care systems. By using recommendations for component needs across the continuum of care, community leaders can use CAST to more effectively and efficiently prioritize resource allocation.",0,0,
115,"Sardjito and PKU Hospital, a universal precautionary education intervention for healthcare workers in Indonesia","non-randomized control trial was conducted to develop and evaluate a culturally appropriate academic elaboration intervention on universal precautions knowledge, attitude, and behavior of healthcare workers in hospitals. 55 healthcare professionals (44 nurses and 11 doctors) participated in the study. They were visited individually to discuss the principles of universal precautions as well as the impact of autopilot on business practices. Self-reported measures of knowledge and attitude were collected from each participant before and after the intervention. A nurse observer collected participants' measures of compliance with the universal precautions guidelines before and after the intervention according to a predetermined protocol. There was a significantly different level of knowledge, attitude and compliance with regard to universal precautions between the control and intervention hospital, with p=0.0007, p=0.038 and p=0.03, respectively, after the intervention. It was concluded that the academic elaboration training approach used in this study significantly improved knowledge, attitude and compliance scores.",0,0,
116,Trial of AA cluster randomized decision support strategies to reduce antibiotic use in acute bronchitis,"Background National quality indicators show little change in the overuse of antibiotics for uncomplicated acute bronchitis. We compared the impact of 2 decision support strategies on antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Methods We conducted a 3-arm randomized trial among 33 primary care practices of an integrated healthcare system in central Pennsylvania. Printed decision support intervention sites (11 apps) received decision support for acute cough sickness through a print-based strategy, computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (11 apps) received decision support through an electronic medical record-based strategy, and control zones (11 apps) received a served as the control arm. Both intervention sites received feedback on clinician education and prescribing practices at check-in, as well as patient education brochures. Antibiotic prescription rates for uncomplicated acute bronchitis during the winter period following intervention initiation (October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010) were compared with the previous 3 winter periods in a therapeutic analysis. Results Percentage of adolescents and adults prescribed antibiotics during the intervention period compared to baseline on print decision support intervention sites (80.0% to 68.3%) and computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (74.0% to 68%) 0.3) 60.7%, but slightly increased in control areas (from 72.5% to 74.3%). After controlling for patient and clinician characteristics, as well as clustering of observations by clinician and practice site, differences for intervention regions were statistically significant from control regions (P = .003 and P = .01 computer-assisted decision support intervention sites versus control regions versus printed decision support intervention sites. sites) but not among themselves (P = .67 for computer-assisted decision support intervention sites versus printed decision support intervention sites). Changes in total visits, 30-day revisit rates, and rate of diagnosed uncomplicated acute bronchitis were similar across study sites. Conclusions Implementing a decision support strategy for acute bronchitis can help reduce the overuse of antibiotics in primary care. The impact of print and computer-assisted decision support strategies for providing decision support was equivalent.",1,1,
117,Adult personality and behavior abnormalities (section F 6) -- Results of the ICD-10 field trial,"Personality disorders, the most important category of the F6 section, were examined in the ICD-10 field study. Overall Kappa values for the inter-interpretive reliability of the F6 section were 0.64, 0.61 for personality disorders, and 0.73 for dyssocial personality. These results are very close to the results of the DSM-III field trials. Subjective assessments of feasibility, suitability, and goodness of fit indicate good acceptance of diagnostic guidelines by clinicians. Comparison of ICD-9, DSM-III, and ICD-10 diagnoses provided broad agreement for personality disorders diagnoses, with overlapping Kappa values of 0.91 and 0.94.

118,Academic details have no impact on asthma medication prescribing in Danish general practice: a 3-year randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up.,"BACKGROUND: Educational outreach visits, especially when combined with social marketing, appear to be a promising approach to health professionals' behavior, particularly prescribing. Results from previous studies have shown a variable effect. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to examine the effect of academic elaboration as a clinical guideline application method in general practice. METHODS: A cluster of randomized, controlled, blinded studies was conducted comparing the effect of an academic detail visit to the mailing distribution of a guideline for asthma medication prescribing. Half of the practices in a Danish county of 100 practices were visited once. The outcome measure was data routinely collected from all Danish pharmacies on the sale of asthma medications. Data were collected monthly 2 years before and 1 year after intervention. RESULTS: There was no effect on the way asthma medications were prescribed after the visit, neither immediately nor in the long term. CONCLUSION: We found no effect of academic elaboration as a single intervention.",0,0,

122,Achieving change in primary care – reasons for the evidence for the practice gap: systematic reviews of reviews,"Background This study is to identify, summarize and synthesize the literature on the reasons for the evidence for the practice gap for complex interventions in primary care. Design This study is a systematic review of reviews. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO were searched from baseline to December 2013. Appropriate reviews addressed the reasons for the evidence for the practice gap in primary care in developed countries. Data from the included reviews were extracted and synthesized using guidelines for meta-synthesis. Results Seventy reviews met the inclusion criteria and covered a wide range of topics, eg guideline implementation, integration of new roles, technology implementation, public health and preventive medicine. None of the included articles used the term Â¡Â°whyÂ¡Â± or made any clear intention to investigate reasons. A descriptive approach was often used, and the articles included expressed Â¡Â°reasonsÂ¡Â± Â¡Â°obstacles and practical facilitatorsÂ¡Â±. We developed a four-level framework covering the external context, organisation, professionals and intervention. External contextual factors included policies, incentive structures, dominant paradigms, stakeholder engagement, advances in infrastructure and technology. Organizational factors include culture, available resources, integration with existing processes, relationships, skill mix and staff involvement. At the level of individual professionals, professional role, basic philosophy of care and competencies were important. Characteristics of the intervention that impacted implementation included evidence of benefit, ease of use, and adaptability to local conditions. We assume that the ¡Â°fitÂ¡Â± between intervention and context is critical in determining the success of the implementation. Conclusions This comprehensive review review summarizes the available information on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of various complex interventions in primary care. To maximize the uptake of complex interventions in primary care, healthcare professionals and commissioning agencies must consider the spectrum of contextual factors, while remaining aware of the dynamic nature of the context. Future work should place emphasis on defining the context and expressing the relationships among the factors described here.",0,0,
123,Reaching guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care: is physician training sufficient?,"OBJECTIVES: The authors examine whether physician education has lasting effects on the treatment of depression. METHODS: Depressed primary care patients who started antidepressant treatment from primary care clinics of a staff model health care institution were studied. Quasi-experimental and pre-post comparisons of physician practices supported by patient questionnaires were used to compare caregiving and depression outcomes. The intervention consisted of extensive physician training spanning 12 months. This includes case-by-case consultations, didactics, academic elaboration (for example, clearly articulating educational and behavioral goals to each physician), and role-playing of optimal treatment. The main outcome measures were divided into two groups. Quasi-experimental examples included: (1) choice of antidepressant medication and (2) adequacy (dose and duration) of pharmacotherapy. Survey samples included: (3) follow-up intensity""; (4) physician provided educational messages on depression treatment; (5) patient satisfaction;"" and (6) depression outcomes. RESULTS: No sustained training effect was consistently observed in any of the measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There was no lasting improvement in depression treatment for primary care patients. However, depression treatment guidelines were obtained concurrently for intervention patients enrolled in a well-rounded collaborative care program during the training period. These results suggest that, in addition to physician education, ongoing programs of reorganized service delivery programs to support the role of the primary care physician (e.g., onsite mental health personnel, close monitoring of patient progress and compliance) are essential for the success of physician education. guide app.",0,0,
124,Smoking Cessation Action in Suspected Tuberculosis (ASSIST) in Pakistan,"Background: Tobacco use is responsible for most of the total disease burden from tuberculosis. Pakistan is one of the 10 countries with a high burden of both tuberculosis and tobacco use. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral support intervention and bupropion in achieving 6 months of continuous abstinence in adult smokers with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial. (Available Controlled Trials: ISRCTN08829879) Setting: Health centers in Jhang and Sargodha districts, Pakistan. Patients: 1955 adult smokers with suspected tuberculosis. Intervention: Health centers were randomly assigned to provide 2 short behavioral support sessions (BSS), BSS plus 7 weeks of bupropion therapy (BSS+), or usual care. Measurements: The primary endpoint was sustained abstinence 6 months after the quit date and was determined by carbon monoxide levels in patients. Secondary endpoints were point absence at 1 and 6 months. Results: Both treatments resulted in statistically significant relative risks (RRs) for abstinence compared with usual care (RR for BSS+, 8.2 [95% CI, 3.7 to 18.2]"";"" BSS for RR, 7.4 [CI, 3.4] to 16.4]). Equivalence between treatments could not be established. 275 of 606 patients in the BSS+ group (45.4% [CI, 41.4% to 49.4%]), 254 of 620 patients in the BSS group (41.0% [CI, 37.1% to 45.0%]), and 52 of 52 patients achieved sustained abstinence. it did. 615 (8.5% [CI, 6.4% to 10.9%]) in the usual care group. There was significant heterogeneity of program effects among clusters. Limitations: Imbalances in urban and rural rates, and inability to confirm smoking habits and adherence to bupropion therapy among treatment groups, and the inability to confirm longer-term abstinence or the effect of smoking cessation on tuberculosis outcomes. Conclusion: Behavioral support alone or in combination with bupropion is effective in quitting smokers with suspected tuberculosis.

126,Acute coronary syndromes without ST segment elevation. From randomized clinical trials to consensus guidelines to clinical practice in Italy: the need to close the circle,"Recent therapeutic advances in the treatment of acute ischemic heart disease have been proven in randomized clinical trials and endorsed by official practice guidelines. This rigorous approach has led to a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, contemporary registries of non-ST-elevation ACS established by the cardiology community in Italy as well as the rest of Europe and the Americas have shown only limited compliance with the general indication to treat high-risk patients at an early age. Invasive approach, protected by the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers. This partial failure in the process of improving patient care can be attributed to various reasons, such as suspicion that practice guidelines may be biased due to conflicts of interest, concerns about the real-world applicability of clinical research results, and unrealistic expectations about treatment. effects and, finally, logistical and economic barriers, including the availability of laboratories and the high cost of platelet receptor blockers. While practice guidelines provide cultural support for translating clinical trial outcomes into patient care, and national and local cardiology associations can help raise awareness of the true benefits of early aggressive management in high-risk patients, healthcare administrators must remove bureaucratic barriers and resources from unproven treatments. to those clearly shown to reduce mortality and risk of re-infarction in their patients.",0,0,

A diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was suggested at baseline with a history of typical prodromal malaise and vomiting, and deep hypoglycemia and rapid-onset hepatic encephalopathy with only minor increases in transaminase activities. Computed tomography was performed: there was no liver or spleen enlargement, but the attenuation value on the liver showed significant fatty infiltration in the liver, making the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Computed tomography is valuable in the diagnosis of liver disease in late pregnancy and this technique may become the method of choice for the investigation of acute fatty liver of pregnancy.",0,0,
128,Adding evidence-based interventions to assertive community treatment: a feasibility study,"OBJECTIVE: This 24-month study conducted in the Netherlands examined the feasibility of increasing the efficacy of assertive community therapy (ACT) by adding evidence-based interventions. METHODS: A total of 159 patients were randomly assigned to two ACT teams, one providing standard ACT (N585) and an ACT Plus team (N574) providing evidence-based interventions: psychoeducation, family interventions, individual placement and support, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Interventions were conducted by psychologists and nurse practitioners working independently of the ACT team. RESULTS: Only 12 (16%) of 74 patients successfully completed an intervention, although most patients were considered eligible for each of the four interventions (range 65% to 89%). Outcomes such as inpatient care use for ACT Plus and standard ACT patients did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia should consider the feasibility of providing evidence-based interventions to difficult-to-access patients.",0,0,
129,Adding exercise or subtracting sitting time for glycemic control: where do we stand?,"While regular structured exercise is a well-established (albeit arguably underused) cornerstone in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes, population adherence to recommended exercise guidelines remains stubbornly low. In fact, most adults are exposed to environmental conditions (at work, driving, and at home) that not only limit their physical activity but also encourage prolonged sitting. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that reducing sitting time and taking a break may also be a useful strategy for improving glycemic control. In this issue of Diabetologia, Duvivier and colleagues report findings that suggest that reducing sitting time with standing and light-intensity activity may be a potential alternative to structured exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We review and discuss the findings of this study, its potential clinical implications, and a number of knowledge gaps and opportunities that could be exploited for the benefit of future research. Duvivier and colleagues' findings should encourage health practitioners, researchers, and type 2 diabetes patients to consider the full spectrum of physical activity, from sedentary behavior to structured exercise.",0,0,
130,Adding motivational interventions to exercise and traditional physiotherapy: a review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Undisputed epidemiological trends indicate that an increase in chronic lifestyle-related diseases will dominate mortality and morbidity in the foreseeable future. International guidelines recommend applying evidence-based approaches to drive health behavior changes. Motivational interventions to increase fitness and physical activity are by no means part of traditional physiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of adding motivational interventions to traditional physiotherapy to increase physical activity and short- and long-term adherence to exercise prescriptions. DATA SOURCES: Literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED and Allied Health Evidence database using keywords and topics. STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized controlled trials comparing two or more arms, focusing on motivational interventions affecting one arm exercise, and a control arm, were included. The search identified 493 titles, of which 14 studies (consisting of 1504 participants) were included. DATA DRAWING: The principal investigator extracted data that was independently reviewed by another author. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the PEDro scale. Outcomes were measured at the level of impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. The standardized mean difference between control and intervention groups at follow-up time points was used as the mode of analysis. I2</=50% was used as the cut-off point for acceptable heterogeneity, above which the random effects model was applied. RESULTS: Exercise attendance was measured in six studies (n=378) and results show no significant difference in exercise participation between groups (Random-effects model, standardized mean difference 0.33, 95% confidence interval -0.03 to 0.68, I2 62%). Perceived self-efficacy results were pooled from six studies (n=722) and a significant difference was found between groups in favor of interventions (Fixed effects model, standardized mean difference 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.87, I2 41 %) . Results for activity limitation levels were pooled (n=550) and a significant difference was found between groups in favor of interventions (REM, standardized mean difference -0.37, 95% confidence interval -0.65 to -0.08, I( 2) 61%). LIMITATIONS: Most of the included studies were of moderate quality and four studies were of low quality. Data were collected from a wide variety of different populations and environments, increasing the diversity of study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interventions can help exercise adherence, have a positive effect on long-term exercise behavior, increase self-efficacy, and reduce activity restriction levels. Although all interventions show benefits, the optimal choice of theory and the most beneficial length and type of intervention have not been defined. There is a need to determine how physiotherapists are currently optimizing compliance and their current level of knowledge about motivational interventions. IMPLEMENTATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Results show that motivational interventions are successful for promoting healthy physical activity behavior. Physiotherapists are ideally positioned to take on this role, and motivational interventions should become part of physiotherapy practice.",0,0,
131,Addressing nicotine addiction in women. The role of the midwife,"Smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer, cardiovascular disease and other premature death among women in the United States. Tobacco use accounts for 10% of perinatal mortality and is 100% preventable. Smoking is now more common in adolescent girls than boys. Women's health care providers are in an excellent position to respond to this growing epidemic. This article discusses the health consequences of smoking, as well as the social, economic and emotional effects of smoking on women and their families. The reasons why women start and continue smoking despite the known risks are investigated. The role of the midwife in the treatment of lifelong nicotine addiction in women was examined.

132,Adherence to NICE guidelines on diabetes prevention in the UK: impact on patient knowledge and perceived risk,"BACKGROUND: NICE Guidelines for diabetes prevention include identification of people at risk followed by cost-effective intervention if needed. Based on risk assessment through a questionnaire and/or blood test, intervention may include a brief discussion of risk factors and a referral to preventive advice or intensive lifestyle intervention. DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENT: In this cross-sectional study, 59 subjects recruited from local GP practices were invited by letter to participate in a screening for diabetes prevention study. METHODS: After a telephone screening in which subjects were asked whether they were informed whether they were at high risk for type 2 diabetes, eligible subjects completed the Risk Perception Questionnaire for Developing Diabetes (RPS-DD), an approved diabetes risk score, and oral in a medical screening. Glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed. RESULTS: As measured by the Diabetes UK Risk Score, 44.1% were at high risk, 42.4% at moderate risk and 13.6% at high risk. 42% of patients were informed by a healthcare professional that they were at high risk. Those who were informed about their risks had significantly higher perceived risk scores (p<0.001), higher knowledge scores (p<0.001) and lower optimism scores (p=0.004), but they were not aware of the diet (p=0.42). and weight management (p=0.57) may play a role in diabetes prevention.

133,adolescent birth control,"PIP: Many adolescents in the United States are at risk of an unplanned pregnancy despite advances in birth control technology and the increasing availability of birth control methods. Physicians dealing with adolescents should be familiar with the various contraceptive measures and their suitability for adolescents. A healthcare professional should also be prepared to participate in sex education and to individually counsel or refer adolescent patients when sexual problems arise. In this discussion of adolescent contraception, attention is directed to the following: reasons for not using contraception, postcoital contraception, oral contraception (contraindications, side effects, adolescent guidelines and the mini-pill (progestogen only), IUDs, diaphragms, vaginal chemical contraceptives, condoms, withdrawal or rhythm, intervention techniques, and choice of appropriate method The average adolescent experiences unprotected sex for a year or more before requesting contraception. Current evidence shows that more teenagers today are using contraception than ever before. some of them cannot use a method for various reasons. Most of the reasons reflect lack of knowledge; some reflect inaccessibility. Reasons include not knowing their fertility periods, belief that their age is protective, infrequent or unexpected sexual intercourse. The idea of being prepared for the possibility of sexual intercourse The strong feelings of guilt that the relationship evokes. Many adolescents are hesitant to seek contraceptive advice or prescriptions from private doctors for fear of moralizing and being denied their wishes. There is evidence in at least 1 study that the presence of a family planning clinic in the school is effective in reducing pregnancy rates and maintaining high attendance rates after 36 months of follow-up. Intervention techniques that can be effective include offering a highly motivated method immediately after an event (abortion, childbirth, rape) and tailoring the method to the person's lifestyle and preference. If there are no contraindications, the preferred method and a method suitable for the frequency of sexual intercourse should be given to the young person. A backup method should also be provided if the preferred method is not tolerated or has never been initiated. Frequent follow-up is essential to maximize attendance rates.",0,0,

Community level management is required as specialist services are limited. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines a management plan for overweight adolescents in general practice using a chronic care approach and follows the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity do not resolve spontaneously during adolescence and active intervention is required both to improve current health and well-being and to reduce the risks of early morbidity and mortality in adult life. Modest, cumulative changes in lifestyle along with modest weight loss goals are important to reduce the risk of weight rebound.

135,Adolescent violence prevention practices among California pediatricians,"OBJECTIVE: To examine pediatricians' provision of violence prevention services for adolescent patients and to identify factors related to pediatricians' implementation of these services. DESIGN: A cross-sectional sample of California pediatricians completed a self-report questionnaire. The ""Pre/Advanced"" theoretical model guided the survey in identifying factors associated with pediatricians' implementation of screening and interventions to prevent adolescent violence. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatricians (54% female, 66% white, 24% Asian, 5% Latino, and 5% other) participated in the study. On average, participants screened patients for risk factors for violence related to fighting in 31%, violence at home in 39%, and carrying a gun in 29%. Participants provided their at-risk patients with violence-related interventions less than 50% of the time (on average) by performing the following interventions: written materials, follow-up appointments, disciplinary counseling or referral to a community agency, Child Protective Services, or a specialized adolescent clinic. Factors associated with violence prevention screening practices included: Positive attitudes and beliefs about violence screening, familiarity with violence prevention guidelines, use of prompts in medical records, greater perception of skills, and positive support from patients and colleagues to provide violence prevention services (R(2)=0.44 ""; P<.001. Factors associated with violence prevention intervention practices included: positive attitudes and beliefs about violence screening, availability of resources, and positive support from patients and colleagues to provide violence prevention services ( R(2)=0.37;"" P<. .001). CONCLUSIONS: California pediatricians do not extensively screen adolescent patients for risk factors associated with adolescent violence and do not provide interventions for adolescent patients who may be at risk of violence. Factors associated with pediatricians' implementation of violence prevention services can assist in the development of effective interventions designed to improve their delivery of these services to their adolescent patients.",0,0,
136,"Adoption, attainment, implementation and maintenance of behavioral and mental health assessment in primary care","OBJECTIVE: Guidelines recommend screening patients for unhealthy behaviors and mental health problems. Health risk assessments can systematically identify patient needs and trigger care. This study aims to evaluate whether primary care practices can routinely apply such assessments to routine care. METHODS: As part of the randomized clustering study, 9 different primary care practices implemented My Own Health Report (MOHR) – an electronic or paper-based health behavior and mental health assessment and feedback system paired with counseling and goal setting. We observed how apps integrate MOHR into their workflow, how much additional practice staff time they require, and what percentage of patients complete a MOHR assessment (Access). RESULTS: Most upcoming applications (60%) agreed to adopt MOHR. How they implemented the MOHR depended on their practice resources, computing capacity, and patient characteristics. Three apps sent invitations to patients to complete MOHR on the Web, 1 called patients and completed MOHR over the phone, 1 patient completed MOHR in the office on paper, and 4 staff members helped patients complete MOHR on the Web in the office. Overall, 3,591 patients were reached and 1,782 completed the MOHR (Reach = 49.6%). Reach varied according to the strategy of implementing the MOHR with higher reach when completed by staff than patients (71.2% vs. 30.2%, P < .001). No application was able to sustain the complete MOHR assessment without adaptations after study completion. Fielding MOHR increased staff and clinician time by an average of 28 minutes per visit. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices can implement health behavior and mental health assessments, but counseling patients effectively requires effort. Apps will need more support to implement and maintain assessments.",0,1,

There is a need for curricula that are likely to improve end-of-life care for NF physicians. To this end, an exemplary medical school palliative care curriculum was modified for experienced NF physicians. Adult learning techniques and interactions likely to change physician behavior are emphasized. Included were opinion leader involvement, monitoring with feedback, use of consensus guidelines, and other techniques for changing physician behavior. Written materials to support the course were determined. This new program has been pilot tested and developed. Initial supervision of physician practices and survey of UF staff, a half-day adult education session, and follow-up with the NF medical director are recommended. This intervention should be tested to determine whether it improves patient end-of-life care outcomes in this setting.",0,0,

Despite being studied extensively, healthcare A&F interventions remain variablely effective, with overall effect sizes not improving since 2003. Contributing to this stagnation is that most healthcare A&F interventions are largely designed from a behavioral perspective without being informed by theoretical understanding. and social sciences. To determine whether the trend could be improved, the aim of this study was to develop a list of testable, theory-informed hypotheses about how to design more effective A&F interventions. Methods Using purposive sampling, semi-structured 60-90 minute telephone interviews were conducted with experts in A&F-related theories from various fields (eg cognitive, health and organizational psychology, medical decision making, economics). Guided by detailed descriptions of A&F interventions from the healthcare literature, the interviewees described how they would approach the problem of designing improved A&F interventions. From the interviews, specific hypotheses with theory knowledge about the conditions for the effective design and delivery of A&F interventions were elicited. The resulting hypotheses were assigned to themes and theme categories in an iterative process by three independently working coders. Results We conducted 28 interviews and identified 313 theory-informed hypotheses embedded in 30 themes. The 30 themes included hypotheses about the following five categories: A&F recipient (seven themes), A&F content (ten themes), A&F's delivery process (six themes), A&F's focus on behavior (three themes). ) and other (four themes). Results We identified a set of testable, theory-informed hypotheses from a wide variety of behavioral and social sciences that suggest conditions for more effective A&F interventions. This study illustrates the breadth of perspectives on A&F from non-healthcare-specific disciplines, generating testable hypotheses for health A&F interventions. These results will serve as the basis for further work to identify research priorities among the A&F research community.",0,0,

Cognitive behavioral therapy intervention based on a village doctor may be one way to improve accessibility. The aim of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention given by trained village doctors to treat advanced age depression in rural China. METHODS: We conducted a focus group meeting with 10 village physicians, 10 individual interviews with each village doctor, and individual interviews with 19 elderly adults. The topic guides were the advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of village doctors and older adults. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Village doctors emphasized the importance of role-playing in education and the use of didactic guides. Appropriate supervision was also an important component of the program. The benefits from the intervention for the village doctors and the elderly were positive, such that both doctors and the elderly were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (addiction and perceived policy assessment) facilitated older people's access to mental health services. Challenges included the lack of real therapy (as opposed to role playing) demonstrated in the training and the lack of a step-by-step guide based on the different types of problems encountered. Other obstacles to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of the village doctors and the presence of other people in carrying out the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the intervention program can be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China, if the various challenges are addressed appropriately.",0,0,
142,Counseling for Patients Seeking Complementary and Alternative Medical Treatments for Cancer,"Many patients with cancer use complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies. Physicians need authoritative information about CAM therapies to responsibly advise patients seeking these interventions. This article summarizes the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of selected CAM therapies commonly used by cancer patients. The following main categories of interventions are covered: dietary modification and supplementation, herbal products and other biological agents, acupuncture, massage, exercise and psychological and mind and body therapies. Two categories of evidence for efficacy are considered: possible effects on disease progression and survival, and possible palliative effects. When evaluating the evidence for safety, two types of risks are considered: the risk of direct side effects and the risk of interaction with conventional treatments. For each therapy, the balance of available evidence for efficacy and safety depends on whether the therapy is reasonably recommended, accepted (e.g., reduction of dietary fat in patients with well-nourished breast or prostate cancer) or discouraged (e.g., high-dose vitamin A supplementation). . This strategy allows for the development of an approach to provide responsible, evidence-based, patient-centered advice to people with cancer seeking CAM treatments.",0,0,

145,Alcohol-related and non-alcoholic activity participation and enjoyment among college students: A behavioral theory of choice analysis.,"Alcohol abuse by college students remains a major public health problem, and there is a need for theory-based and empirically-based models to guide prevention efforts. Behavioral choice theories assume that the decision to consume alcohol is influenced by the relative value of alcohol relative to other available activities. In this study, a sample of college student drinkers (N=108""; ""56% female, 44% male) who had previously completed a mandatory alcohol intervention completed a measure of alcohol-related and non-alcoholic activity participation and pleasure. The aims of the study were to examine the effect of drinking amount and contextual variables on enjoyment from the activity, and to identify enjoyable non-alcoholic activities that take place in the evenings that students might otherwise be drinking. Overall, students found alcohol-related activities more enjoyable than non-alcoholic activities, and the amount of drinking was positively associated with enjoyment. But non-alcoholic activities such as watching movies, going to theaters or museums, going to bars or parties, hanging out with friends, dining at restaurants, and engaging in creative activities were often just as enjoyable as drinking. Non-alcoholic activities involving peers or dates were more fun than solo activities. Men were less likely to participate in non-alcoholic activities involving their peers and reported that they enjoyed non-alcoholic activities less than women. More research is needed to identify procedures for increasing participation in non-alcoholic activities and to determine whether increased participation in non-alcoholic activities reduces alcohol consumption.

146,Everything you need to read in other general magazines,"Between 1998 and 2009, a single surgeon in France reconstructed the genitals of 2,938 women who had been mutilated or cut off when they were girls. One of the largest case series ever suggests that surgery may help at least some women with a history of female genital mutilation achieve a pain-free, acceptable sex life. Most of the women were from French-speaking West Africa, but more than 564 had undergone FGM while growing up in France. Almost all of them sought surgery to restore their female identity and autonomy above all else. All four-fifths were looking for a better sex life. All had undergone female genital mutilation, which removed or damaged the clitoris, at an average age of 6 years. One of the goals of the surgery was to reconstruct a normal clitoris. More than three-quarters (78% (2053/2613)) of women presenting for surgery had never had an orgasm. Only 866 women (29%) returned to follow-up one year after surgery. About half (414/840) reported improvement in pain. Slightly less improvement in sexual pleasure (385/834) was reported and 430 have now had orgasms. We don't know how they feel about their bodies after surgery, and future studies should include measures of validated identity, satisfaction with surgery, and global satisfaction with sex, says a linked comment (doi:10.1016/S0140)-6736(12)60636-9).

147,Alliance not alignment: coaching strategies to improve type 2 diabetes outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate strategies to improve patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: Literature on type 2 diabetes management, behavior change, communication, diabetes self-management, and coaching. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies currently recommended to improve patient outcomes, such as increasing provider adherence to evidence-based management guidelines, streamlining delivery systems, and promoting patient lifestyle changes through intensive education, have produced mixed results. Among the many complexities involved in managing type 2 diabetes, motivating patients to change their behavior may be the most difficult. One recommendation to improve self-management of type 2 diabetes patients is to use coaching communication in the context of behavior change in the context of the primary care encounter between nurse practitioners (NPs) and their patients. APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Given the diverse implications of current strategies, coaching by NPs may provide a viable alternative to improve patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Coaching communication can be implemented as a free intervention during office visits. However, in order to apply this approach effectively, more formal training in applying NPs and this expected but underdeveloped NP role competence of NP students is required. NPs are asked to contribute the knowledge needed to validate the merits of coaching for their patients.",0,0,
148,Alprazolam prescribing in Tasmania: a two-fold intervention designed to reduce inappropriate prescribing and concomitant opioid prescribing,"OBJECTIVE: The population rate of alprazolam prescribing in Tasmania has been more than double the national rates. Serious adverse events have been observed through co-administration of opioid drugs with alprazolam. To reduce the inappropriate prescribing of alprazolam and thus reduce adverse outcomes, a two-fold intervention was designed that included family practice education and changes to prescribing regulations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the intervention on prescribing rates. METHODS: We measured the number of alprazolam prescriptions for the year before and after the intervention. Health Insurance Commission data were used and compared with national data to enable comparisons of subsidized prescription rates for alprazolam in Tasmania. Participants were registered medical practitioners in Tasmania who were potentially prescribing alprazolam. Interventions were three GP Education Meetings in June 2007, one in each of the major Tasmania regions on evidence-based interventions for panic disorder. Changes to regulatory procedures were implemented in September 2007 to minimize the co-prescription of alprazolam with opioids. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in alprazolam prescribing occurred in Tasmania after interventions. CONCLUSION: Education can be an effective strategy for influencing physicians' prescribing behavior. This impact is likely to increase with the adoption of stricter regulatory requirements.",0,0,

METHODS: Recommendations are based on a rigorous review of clinical evidence with transparent inclusion of subjective factors. RESULTS: 160 specific expressions (85 [53.1%] strong [Grade A]"";"" 48 [30.0%] moderate [Grade B] and 11 [6.9%] weak [ 16 [10.0%] constituting a comprehensive medical care plan for obesity) Grade C] with [Class D]) based on expert opinion. There were 133 (83.1%) statements based on strong (best level of evidence [BEL] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or moderate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) scientific evidence. There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based grades of recommendation (AC Grade = 144) adjusted for subjective factors. Of the 1,790 reference citations used in this CPG, 524 (29.3%) were based on strong (level of evidence [EL] 1), 605 (33.8%) moderate (EL 2), and 308 (17.2%). weak (EL 3) based on scientific studies, 353 (19.7%) reviews and opinions (EL 4). CONCLUSION: Recent recommendations recognize obesity as a complex, adiposity-based chronic disease in which management targets both weight-related complications and obesity to improve overall health and quality of life. Detailed evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision making that addresses the real-world medical care of patients with obesity, including screening, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment selection, treatment goals, and individualization of care. The aim is to facilitate high-quality care of patients with obesity and to provide a rational, scientific approach to management that optimizes health outcomes and safety.

153,American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: concussion in sports,"UNLABELED: PURPOSE OF REPORT: black triangle right To provide a summary of evidence-based, best practices to assist physicians in the evaluation and management of sports concussion. black triangle right To identify level of evidence, knowledge gaps, and areas requiring additional research. IMPORTANCE OF AMSSM NOTICE: right black triangle Sports physicians are often involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. black triangle right Sports medicine physicians are specially trained to provide care throughout the continuum of sports concussion, from acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. black triangle right Athletes with sports concussion are ideally cared for by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by education and experience, not expertise. black triangle right This phrase is intended for sports medicine physicians, but may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion. DEFINITION: right black triangle Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient impairment of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), which is usually self-limited and is on the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: right black triangle Animal and human studies support the concept of post-concussion vulnerability by showing that a second blow worsens metabolic changes within the cell before the brain recovers. black triangle on the right Experimental evidence suggests that the concussed brain is less responsive to the usual neural activation and may be vulnerable to long-term dysfunction when early cognitive or physical activity occurs before full recovery. INCIDENCE: black triangle right It is estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the United States each year during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of concussions may go unreported. black triangle right Concussions have the highest incidence in football, hockey, occurs in all sports, which is rugby, football and basketball RISK FACTORS FOR SPORTS RELATED ATTACK: black triangle right History of a concussion is associated with a higher risk of having another concussion black triangle right Greater number, severity, and duration of symptoms after a concussion, are predictors of a long-term recovery. black triangle right In sports with similar rules of play, the reported incidence of concussions is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. black triangle right Some sports, positions, and individual styles of play carry a greater risk of concussions. black triangle right Young athletes more can have a long-term recovery and result in a catastrophic injury is more prone to a concussion that accompanies it. black triangle right Pre-injury mood disorders, learning disorders, attention deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD), and migraine headaches complicate the diagnosis and treatment of a concussion. EPIDEMIC DIAGNOSIS: right black triangle Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare provider who knows the athlete and is knowledgeable in recognizing and assessing concussion. black triangle right Graded symptom checklists provide an objective tool for assessing the various symptoms associated with concussions while also tracking the severity of these symptoms through serial assessments. black triangle right Standard assessment tools provide a useful framework for assessing concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available. SIDE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT: black triangle right Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and evaluated by a licensed healthcare provider trained in the assessment and management of concussions. black triangle right Recognition and initial assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptom checklist, cognitive assessment (including orientation, past and recent memory, new learning, and concentration), balance tests, and advanced neurological physical examination. black triangle right While standardized sideline tests are a useful framework for review, the sensitivity, specificity, validity, and reliability of these tests across different age groups, cultural groups, and settings remain largely undefined. The practical benefits, with or without an individual initial test, are also largely unknown. black triangle right Balance impairment is a specific indicator of a concussion, but it is not very sensitive. The sideline balance test may differ significantly from the baseline tests due to differences in shoe/came type or surface, use of ankle bands or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injuries. black triangle right Imaging is reserved for athletes with suspected intracerebral hemorrhage. black triangle right For an athlete diagnosed with a concussion, there is no same-day RTP. black triangle right Athletes who are suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be monitored for worsening physical or mental condition. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST: right black triangle Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behavior relationships and are more sensitive to subtle cognitive impairment than clinical examination. black triangle right Most concussions can be properly managed without the use of NP testing. Black triangle right Computerized neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the test type and individual test limitations, including an informed assessment of the reliable index of change, baseline variability, and false positive and false negative rates. . black triangle right Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, testing different areas and evaluating other conditions that may mask concussion or complicate concussion assessment. The black triangle right NP test should only be used as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used alone. The ideal timing, frequency, and type of black triangle right NP testing have not been determined. black triangle right In some cases, appropriately administered and interpreted NP testing provides an added value for assessing cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussions. black triangle right It is not known whether the use of the NP test in the management of sports concussion helps prevent repetitive concussion, catastrophic injury, or long-term complications. right black triangle Comprehensive NP assessment aids in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complex courses. BACK TO CLASS: black triangle right Students will need cognitive rest and may need academic adjustments such as less workload and longer time for tests when recovering from a concussion. BACK TO PLAYING: black triangle right Concussion symptoms must be resolved before returning to exercise. black triangle right An RTP progression involves a gradual, gradual increase in physical demands, sport-specific activities, and contact risk. black triangle right If symptoms occur with activity, progress should be stopped and restarted in the previous symptom-free step. black triangle right RTP should only be performed after a concussion with medical clearance from a licensed healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF EARLY RTP: right black triangle The primary concern with Early RTP is that it shortens reaction time, resulting in an increased risk of re-concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: black triangle right There is a growing concern that exposure to head impact and repetitive concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. black triangle right Some research has suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define the risk factors and causes of any long-term neurological disorder. DISQUALIFICATION FROM SPORTS: black triangle right There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport after a concussion. Each case should be carefully discussed and an individualized approach should be taken to determine disqualification. EDUCATION: right black triangle More efforts are needed to educate interested parties, including athletes, parents, coaches, authorities, school administrators and healthcare providers, to improve the recognition, management and prevention of concussion. black triangle right Doctors should be prepared to provide counseling about the possible long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions. PREVENTION: right black triangle The primary prevention of some injuries may be possible through change and enforcement of rules and fair play. black triangle right Both hard (soccer, lacrosse, and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) helmets are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fractures, bleeding, lacerations, etc.), but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity. shake. black triangle right There is no current evidence that mouth guards can reduce or prevent the severity of concussions. black triangle right Secondary prevention may be possible with proper RTP management. LEGISLATION: black triangle right Legislation efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and non-scholastic sports organizations regarding concussion safety and management. FUTURE INSTRUCTIONS: black triangle right Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing, and improve identification of those at risk for prolonged post-concussion symptoms or other long-term complications. black triangle right Newer neuroimaging techniques or emerging technologies such as biomarkers for diagnosing concussion may provide new insights into the assessment and management of sports concussion.",0,0,

155,An academic elaboration intervention to popularize physician-administered smoking cessation counseling: smoking cessation outcomes of the Physicians Counseling Smokers Project.,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effectiveness of interventions to promote smoking cessation interventions among a population of primary care physicians. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a population-based academic elaboration intervention on quit rates in a population-based sample of smokers. METHODS: This population-based, quasi-experimental study included representative samples of 259 primary care physicians and 4295 adult smokers. Academic elaboration intervention was administered to physicians in intervention areas over a 15-month period. Analyzes were performed on data from 2346 subjects who reported at least one doctor visit over 24 months. Multivariate regression analyzes were performed to determine the effect of intervention on self-reported smoking cessation rates and reported with adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Among smokers who reported a doctor visit during the study period, there was a borderline significant effect for residents in intervention areas compared to control areas (OR = 1.35""; 95% CI.99-1.83; P = 0.057). Of 819 smokers, we observed a significant effect for residents of intervention areas (OR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.16-2.75; ""P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: A detailed academic intervention to improve physician-provided smoking cessation counseling is an effective strategy to popularize smoking cessation interventions among community-based practices.",0,0,
156,An administrative intervention to improve the use of laboratory tests in a university hospital,"BACKGROUND: Improving the relevance of test behavior and reducing the number of laboratory tests have been recognized as essential parts of quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an administrative and short-term educational intervention aimed at reducing clinical biochemistry laboratory use. DESIGN: An analysis comparing the use of laboratory tests performed in hospitalized patients before and after intervention. SETTING: Computerized database of all laboratory tests performed at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel between 1999-2003. INTERVENTION: Administrative response included limiting the frequency of available emergency laboratory tests and repeat orders. Educational measures included: discussing the misuse and consequences of laboratory tests with hospital medical staff and presenting the new restrictive policy. A feedback on the results of the intervention was sent to the wards and reviewed with senior medical staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in use of hospital department and selected laboratory tests and clinical biochemistry tests (measured as rates per 100 hospital days). RESULTS: An overall reduction of 19% (95% CI: 18.8-19.2%) in laboratory testing was observed in the year post-intervention. Usage decreased significantly in the range of 14.9-43.8% across all medical departments of the hospital. During the intervention period, use of hematology tests decreased by 7.6% (P = 0.009). Statistically significant reductions were noted in the ranking of all 12 selected clinical biochemistry tests. Although total cholesterol orders decreased by 72.2%, the use of 'high volume' tests such as glucose and electrolytes decreased only modestly (7.9% and 6.9%, respectively). RESULTS: This study included all hospital health personnel and included all clinical biochemistry tests available. This fairly simple and cost-effective intervention resulted in significant reductions in clinical chemistry test orders as well as ordering of hematological blood tests.",0,1,
157,An assessment of user acceptance and satisfaction with tobacco cessation automated clinical practice guidance,"OBJECTIVE: To explain user acceptance and satisfaction of the Henry Ford Health System Tobacco Cessation (TUC) Automated Clinical Practice Guideline (ACPG). STUDY DESIGN: A previous study evaluated compliance with the 5 As of TUC ACPG (ask, advise, evaluate, assist and regulate) in 3 study arms. This article explains user satisfaction with TUC ACPG after implementation. METHODS: In all study arms, providers completed a questionnaire before participating in a focus group. RESULTS: All providers in the TUC arm stated that they ""almost always"" asked their patients about tobacco use. Providers in the TUC arm were generally satisfied with the features of the TUC ACPG, particularly the ease with which a patient was electronically referred to the Smoking Intervention Program. Barriers to use included time constraints, lack of staff, and the willingness to ""exit"" the program for patients in certain circumstances (for example, terminally ill patients). CONCLUSION: Because ACPGs are included in electronic medical records, it is important to obtain provider input prior to administration, to provide technology that is user-friendly and fits the clinic's workflow, and to give physicians the autonomy to opt out of the guideline. in certain clinical situations.",0,0,
158,An automatic minimum retest interval reject rule reduces repetitive CRP workload and expense and influences clinician request behavior,"Objectives Repeated measurements of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) on the same day or on consecutive days have limited clinical value. Minimum retest intervals are recommended to manage unnecessary retests. As not previously reported, we examined the impact of minimum retest interval test refusal on laboratory workload and expenditure and on clinician requesting behavior. Methods In a prospective study, we evaluated the impact of an automated 48-hour CRP minimum retest interval rule on inpatient and outpatient CRP workload and costs. Control data on inpatient and outpatient serum urea and electrolytes (UE) workload were collected during the study. Results Over 1 year, after the minimum retest interval rule was introduced, there was a 7.0% and 12.3% reduction in CRP requests and analyzed CRP tests, respectively, compared to the 1-year baseline period. This equated to an estimated annual reduction in revenue costs of £10500, but a cash savings of £3000 in consumables costs. There was no significant change in UE requests. Conclusions We report for the first time that automated minimum retest interval rejection rules as a standalone strategy are an inexpensive and sustainable method to reduce unnecessary repetitive CRP testing, resulting in small laboratory cash savings, more efficient use of laboratory resources, and standardization. The Minimum retest interval rejection rule of patient care pathways also changed the clinician's test requesting behavior towards more appropriate requesting.",0,1,
159,"An educational program influencing healthcare professionals in recommending exercise to their type 2 diabetes patients - understanding the processes: a case study from Oxfordshire, England","BACKGROUND: Increased levels of physical activity reduce the risk of premature death associated with chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke. Despite this, most adults in the UK do not follow physical activity guidelines. Physical activity advice and signage offered to at-risk patients by primary care providers are recommended. However, training in exercise medicine is scarce, leading to insufficient knowledge of practitioners of the evidence for risk reduction and strategies for implementing effective patient behavior change. The 'Generation Games' intervention aims to increase physical activity in Oxfordshire's 50+ population. It offers a Health Professional Education Program (HPEP) that provides exercise medicine education and the introduction of Generation Games where healthcare professionals can guide patients. There is a weak evidence base on how such education translates into patient exercise behavior change. METHODS: The research aimed to generate greater understanding of how an education program could influence healthcare professionals to recommend the Generation Games and increase exercise behavior in people with type 2 diabetes. A case study method facilitated the review of routines and cultures studied - Diabetes nurses' experience was used as an example of best practice engagement with HPEP. Observation, interview and documentation were used to triangulate the data. Data analysis refined and developed themes within key theoretical frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: First, there is a lack of knowledge about the risk reduction benefits of physical activity and a belief that efforts to motivate patients to increase their physical activity are ineffective and thus create barriers to participation in HPEP. Second, nurses tasked with providing lifestyle advice to people with diabetes – who themselves lack motivational interviewing skills – find ingrained physical activity behaviors extremely difficult and therefore highly value HPEP for providing helpful tools. Third, patients who hear about Generation Games from a healthcare professional may have maladaptive expectations about how their exercise behavior might change. CONCLUSION: Exercise medicine education has the potential to improve patient care and services. For interventions like HPEP to be successful, primary care practices require a more supportive exercise medicine culture. Adequate resources are also required for patient-centered behavior change advice, education, promotion and monitoring services.",0,0,
160,An educational approach to improving outcomes in acute kidney injury (AKI): report of a quality improvement project,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a quality improvement project using a multifaceted educational intervention on how to improve the clinician's knowledge, confidence and awareness of acute kidney injury (AKI). SETTING: 2 large acute teaching hospitals in England serving a combined population of over 1.5 million. PARTICIPANTS: All secondary care clinicians working in clinical areas were targeted, with a particular focus on clinicians working in acute admissions areas. INTERVENTIONS: A versatile educational intervention consisting of traditional didactic lectures, case-based teaching in small groups, and an interactive web-based learning resource. OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed clinicians' knowledge of AKI and self-reported clinical behavior using an interactive questionnaire before and after the educational intervention. Secondary outcome measures included clinical review of patient notes before and after intervention. RESULTS: 26% of clinicians reported that they were aware of local AKI guidelines in the pre-intervention questionnaire, compared to 64% in the follow-up questionnaire (chi&sup2"";=60.2, p<0.001). Improved number of clinicians when diagnosing AKI 50% against 68% (chi&sup2;=12.1, p<0.001) and 48% versus 64% (chi&sup2;""=9.5, p=0.002) when investigating patients with AKI. Those who performed clinical audits showed a trend towards better clinical practice. RESULTS: Utilizing a multifaceted educational intervention, this quality improvement project has increased clinician awareness of AKI, as evidenced by changes in self-reported management of patients with AKI. Project elements have been sustained beyond the project duration and demonstrate the power of quality improvement projects to help initiate changes in practice. Our findings are limited by confounding factors and highlight the need to conduct formal randomized trials to determine the impact of educational interventions in the clinical setting.",0,0,
161,An educational intervention reduces the rate of inappropriate echocardiograms in an inpatient service,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to prospectively examine the impact of an appropriate use criteria (AUC)-based educational intervention on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) order among home staff in an inpatient general internal medicine ward at an academic medical center. BACKGROUND: The AUC for TTE was developed in response to concerns about inappropriate use of TTE. To date, AUC-based educational interventions to reduce inappropriate use of TTE have not been prospectively studied. METHODS: A prospective, time-series analysis of an educational intervention was performed and then compared to TTE ordering in the same medical service during a control period. The intervention consisted of: 1) a conference to staff on the 2011 AUC for TTE""; 2) a pocket card applying the AUC to common clinical scenarios;"" and 3) bi-weekly email feedback on ordering behavior. TTE rank was tracked daily throughout the response period and feedback reports were emailed at 2-week intervals. The primary outcome was the rate of unsuitable and favorable TTE ordered during the intervention period. RESULTS: 99% and 98% of all TTEs ordered during the control and study periods, respectively, could be classified using the 2011 AUC. During the study period, there was a 26% reduction in the number of TTEs ordered per day compared to the number ordered in the control period (2.9 vs. 3.9 TTE, p < 0.001). During the study period, the rate of inappropriate TTE was significantly lower (13% vs. 5%, p < 0.001) and the rate of appropriate TTE was significantly higher (84% vs. 93%, p < 0.001). RESULTS: A simple educational intervention resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of inappropriate TTE and increased the rate of appropriate TTE ordered in an inpatient academic medical service. This study provides a practical approach to use AUC to reduce the number of unsuitable TTEs. Further work is guaranteed in other application environments.",0,0,
162,Efficacy trial of cognitive behavior therapy in a representative sample of outpatients with psychosis,"OBJECTIVES: The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTp) for psychosis is sufficiently established to be included in some national treatment guidelines. However, treatment efficacy does not warrant efficacy in routine practice, where clinician expertise and patient mix may differ. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of CBTp when offered routinely in a public mental health service. DESIGN: A prospectively selected representative sample (N=94) of patients with psychotic disorders from a geographic collection area in Melbourne, Australia were randomized to CBTp or treatment as usual. METHODS: The CBTp intervention included psychoeducation, positive symptom, and comorbid problem components. Therapists jointly negotiated goals with patients and used treatment components from a guideline. Therapeutic analyzes used data at baseline, 9 months, and 18 months. RESULTS: Measures of working alliance and customer satisfaction demonstrated excellent acceptability. Both groups improved to a similar degree on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scales, with no advantage for the CBTp group. The most common CBTp components administered were comorbid disorders/personal problems and personalized psychoeducation""; working with ongoing symptoms was the main focus in relatively few sessions. RESULTS: The reason for the lack of advantage of the CBTp group could be due to: on positive symptoms (most recurring outcome domain for CBTp); patients were not selected nature (rather than those with distressing symptoms or clinician-directed);"" or insufficient therapist expertise.",0,0,
163,An electronic health record-based intervention to improve tobacco treatment in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Background To improve the documentation and treatment of tobacco use in primary care, we developed and implemented a 3-part electronic health record development: (1) smoking status icons, (2) tobacco treatment reminders, and (3) a Tobacco Smart Form. facilitated medication ordering, fax and e-mail referral referrals. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of improvement in 26 primary care practices between 19 December 2006 and 30 September 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of documented smokers who contacted a smoking cessation counselor. Secondary outcomes included coded smoking status documents and medication prescribing. Results During the 9-month study period, 132 630 patients made 315 962 visits to study practices. Codified documentation of smoking status increased from 37% to 54% (+17%) of patients in intervention practices and from 35% to 46% (+11%) of patients in control settings (P < .001 for difference in differences). Among the 9,589 patients documented to be smokers at the start of the study, more patients in the intervention practices were enrolled as non-smokers at the end of the study (1.9% vs. 5.3% in the control practices; P < 0.001). more patients contacted a cessation counselor (3.9% vs. 0.3% in control practices; P < 0.001) No longer likely to prescribe smoking cessation medication to smokers in intervention practices (2% vs. 2% in control practices;"" P = .40). Conclusion This electronic health record-based intervention improved smoking status documentation and increased counseling assistance for smokers, but not cessation medication prescriptions.",0,1,
164,An electronic medical record-based intervention to improve quality of care for atypical presentations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and GERD.,"Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common in primary care but is often underdiagnosed and untreated. GERD may also present with atypical symptoms such as chronic cough and asthma, and physicians may be unaware of this picture. We aimed to implement and evaluate an intervention to improve diagnosis and treatment for GERD and atypical GERD in primary care. Methods This was a randomized controlled trial in a primary care practice using a national network of US practices (Medical Quality Improvement Consortium – MQIC) sharing the same electronic medical record (EMR). Thirteen offices with 53 providers were randomized to the EMR-based prompts and education intervention, and 14 offices with 66 providers were randomized to the control group, which included a total of more than 67,000 patients and examined outcomes of GERD diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Results In patients without GERD at baseline, new GERD diagnoses were significantly increased in the intervention group (3.1%) versus the control group (2.3%) (P<0.01). This remained significant after controlling for clustering, with a diagnosis probability of 1.33 (95% CI 1.13–1.56) for the intervention group. For patients with atypical symptoms, the probability of those in the intervention group being both diagnosed with GERD (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.41–2.88) and treated for GERD (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08–“) was higher. 1.83) more than in the control group. Outcomes Diagnosis and management of GERD in primary care, particularly in patients with atypical symptoms, can be improved with the use of an EMR-based tool that includes decision support and education. However, there is significant room for improvement in the use of appropriate therapy.",1,1,
165,Evaluation of opioid prescription for chronic non-malignant pain by Australian GPs.,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the quality of opioid analgesia prescribed by general practitioners (general practitioners, family physicians) for chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP). DESIGN: An anonymous, cross-sectional survey-based survey. LOCATION: The setting was five Australian general practice divisions (geographically based associations of general practitioners). METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all department members. The outcome measures were adherence to individual recommendations of locally derived CNMP practice guidelines. RESULTS: We received 404 responses (response rate 23.3%). In the previous two weeks, GPs prescribed long-term continuous opioids for CNMP for a median of 4 (+/-8.7) patients with CNMP and a median of 7.1 (+/-8.7) patients with CNMP. Guideline alignment (GLC) was poor, with no GPs always compliant with all guideline items, and only 31% used most items. GLC was highest to avoid high dosages or fast acting formulations. It was the lowest for strategies that minimized individual and public health harms, such as initiating opioids on a time-limited trial basis, using contracts, and preventing or managing abnormal behavior. GLC was positively associated with relevant education or qualifications, enrollment in the Australian Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, being an opioid substitution treatment prescriber, and female gender. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, long-term opioids were often initiated for CNMP without a quality drug use approach. Potential sequelae are inadequate treatment of pain and increased opioid-related harms. These data suggest the need for better sourcing and education in opioid management across pain and addictions.",0,0,
166,Evidence-Based Guide to Writing Grant Proposals for Clinical Trials,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially when compared to provincial facilities. He backed up this claim with statistics published in William Fair's General Registrar's report, which claimed that the death rates of 24 London hospitals exceeded 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died during the year by the number of inpatients in a single day. Calculated by dividing the annual number of deaths by the total number of inpatients during the year, the death rate for London hospitals was 10%. A heated debate erupted in the London medical press about how best to calculate hospital mortality rates. Critics argued that Farr did not adjust to the differences in disease severity between urban and rural hospitals, and that his figures would mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale criticized the poor quality of hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics aimed at comparing provider quality.",0,0,
167,An evolving perspective on physical activity counseling by medical professionals,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for many chronic conditions and a leading cause of premature death. An increasing number of adults worldwide are not participating in adequate levels of physical activity to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. Medical professionals have been identified as potentially potent sources of influence for those who do not meet minimum physical activity guidelines. Health professionals are respected and sources of advice are expected, and they reach a large and engaged proportion of the population. Despite this potential, health professionals do not routinely practice physical activity promotion. CONCLUSION: Medical professionals face several known barriers to promoting physical activity, including lack of time and perceived effectiveness in changing physical activity behavior in patients. In addition, the evidence for effective physical activity promotion by medical professionals is insufficient. To address these issues, new approaches to promoting physical activity are being proposed. These include collaborating with community-based physical activity behavior change interventions, preparing patients for effective brief counseling during a consultation with a medical professional, and the use of interactive behavior change technology. SUMMARY: It is important that we recognize the hidden risk of physical inactivity among patients presenting in clinical settings. Preparation for improving the patient's physical activity behaviors should begin before consultation and may include physical activity screening. Medical professionals should also identify appropriate community interventions that they can refer to physically inactive patients. Outsourcing the majority of a comprehensive physical activity intervention to community-based interventions will reduce the clinical consultation time required to address the issue with each patient. Priorities for future research include exploring ways to promote successful referrals and then participating in comprehensive community support programs to increase the physical activity levels of inactive patients. In addition, future clinical trials of physical activity interventions should be evaluated in the context of a broader outcome framework to inform a systematic assessment of broad strengths and weaknesses related not only to efficacy but also cost-effectiveness and likelihood of successful translation of interventions into clinical contexts.",0,0,
168,An experimental study on the determinants of group judgments in clinical guideline development.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines for improving quality of care are a familiar part of clinical practice. Formal consensus methods, such as the nominal group technique, are often used as part of guideline development, but little is known about the factors influencing the statements produced by nominal groups and their consistency with research evidence. METHODS: Cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy, and antidepressants for irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic back pain were selected for the study. The 16 nominal groups in a factorial design allowed only GPs to be compared with mixed GPs and specialist groups, to provide a literature review without any judgment, and to ratings made in the context of realistic or ideal levels of health care resources. Participants rated fitness independently and after a facilitated meeting. Audio recordings of four group discussions were analyzed. RESULTS: Agreed with research evidence for 51% of the 192 scenarios. Agreement was more likely if the group was GP only, if a literature review was provided, or if the evidence was consistent with clinicians' beliefs. Assumptions about the level of available resources had no effect. Clinical and social cues had mixed effects, regardless of research evidence. Qualitative analysis demonstrated the modifying effect of clinical experience and beliefs about research evidence. COMMENT: Guidelines cannot be based on data alone"";"" Judgment is inevitable. The nominal group technique is a method of revealing and combining judgments in a transparent and structured way. It can provide important information about the levels of agreement between experts.

170,An empirical study of the determinants of the extent of disagreement within clinical guideline development groups.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of design features and clinical and social cues on the extent of conflict among participants in the process of developing a formal consensus. METHODS: Factorial design covering 16 groups of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from the UK. The groups rated the relevance of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of a variety of clinical and social cues. Groups differed in three design features: providing a systematic literature review (versus not provided), group composition (GP vs. mixed only), and assumptions about available healthcare resources (realistic versus idealistic). Disagreement was measured using the mean absolute deviation from a group's median rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly affected the degree of disagreement within the groups (all p>0.3). There was disagreement between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral therapy rather than brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and cues (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: In terms of the extent of disagreement in the groups in this study, formal consensus building was a sound technique as it did not depend on the way the results were conducted.",0,0,

173,An integrative review investigating the decision-making factors affecting mental health nurses' use of restraint.,"UNLABELED: WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT: There is new evidence highlighting the counter-therapeutic effect of restraint use and encouraging minimization of this practice in mental health care. Mental health nurses are often the professional group that uses restraint, and it becomes critical to understand the factors that influence their decision making. To date, there are no other published articles that do a similar extensive research to review this topic. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO CURRENT KNOWLEDGE: The eight themes that emerged were identified as factors that influenced mental health nurses' decision making on the use of restraint. Themes: ""safety for all"", ""restriction as a necessary intervention"", ""restriction as a last resort"", ""role conflict"", ""maintenance of control"", ""staff composition"", ""knowledge and perception of patient behavior"", and ""psychological impact"" '. 'Last resort' seems to be the mantra of the acceptable use of restraint, but to date there are no studies that specifically address what this concept really is. WHAT ARE APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION?: These findings should be considered in evaluating the use of restraint in mental health settings and evaluating appropriate strategies in place to support the transition to restraint minimization. Because the concept of 'last resort' is mentioned in many policies and guidelines internationally without a published understanding of what it means, research should prioritize it as the next critical step in efforts to minimize the restriction. INTRODUCTION: While mechanical and manual restraint may at times seem necessary as a method of institutional control in mental health settings, there is emerging literature that highlights the potential therapeutic impact of this practice for both patients and staff. Nurses are the professional group most likely to use mechanical and manual restraint methods in mental health settings. Therefore, in-depth insights are warranted to understand what factors influence nurses' decisions about restraint use. OBJECTIVE: To investigate what influences mental health nurses' decision to use restraint. METHOD: An integrative review was conducted using Cooper's framework. RESULTS: Eight emerging themes were identified: 'safety for all', 'restriction as a necessary intervention', 'restriction as a last resort', 'role conflict', 'maintaining control', 'personnel composition', 'perception of knowledge and perception'. patient behavior' and 'psychological impact'. These themes highlight how mental health nurses' decision-making is affected by interpersonal and staff factors, as well as ethical and safety responsibilities. CONCLUSION: Research is needed to better understand the 'last resort' experience and implementation in restraint use and to provide strategies to prevent restraint use in mental health settings.",0,0,

176,"An ongoing challenge: a mixed-method systematic review of interventions, barriers and facilitators to achieve optimal self-care by children and youth with type 1 diabetes in educational settings.","BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is more common in young children who are usually of preschool age and enter the education system with diabetes-related support needs that develop over time. It is important that children are supported at school to best manage their diet, exercise, blood sugar monitoring and insulin regimen. Young people are self-directed at college/university. METHOD: A mixed-methods systematic review with theory knowledge to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and to synthesize the facilitators' child/parent/professional views and barriers to achieving optimal diabetes self-care and management in educational settings for children and youth aged 3-25 years. RESULTS: Eleven interventions and 55 opinion studies were included. Meta-analysis was not possible. Study focuses, broadly matched school diabetes guidance. Intervention studies were often limited to specific contexts with a high risk of bias. Opinion studies were mostly of moderate quality and shared transferable findings. Health plans and school nurse support (various types) were effective. At school, telemedicine was instrumental for individual case management. Most educational interventions to increase the knowledge and confidence of children or school staff have had significant short-term effects, but longer follow-up is needed. Children, parents and staff said they struggled with many common structural, organizational, educational and attitudinal school barriers. Aspects of school guidance were not generally implemented (for example, individual health plans). Children recognized and appreciated school staff who were trained and confident in supporting diabetes management. Research with college/university students was lacking. Campus-based college/university students support significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and diabetes self-care. Self-management was easier for students who balanced diabetes management with student lifestyle, such as adopting strategies to manage their alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: This new mixed-methods systematic review is the first to integrate intervention effectiveness with views of children/parents/experts mapped to school diabetes guidelines. Diabetes management can be improved overall with full implementation and control of the guideline effect. The evidence is limited in quality and there is a lack of knowledge about what works. Telemedicine and school nurse support for children between healthcare providers and schools are effective in certain contexts, but not all education systems employ onsite nurses. More innovative and sustainable solutions and sound assessments are needed. Comprehensive lifestyle approaches for college/university students warrant further development and evaluation.",0,0,
177,An update on the management of a patient presenting with acute coronary syndromes without ST elevation.,"More than 780,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) each year. As physicians, it is our responsibility to ensure the prompt examination, diagnosis and management of these patients. After identifying the patient with ACS and confirming no ST-segment elevation MI requiring immediate revascularization, physicians should perform a study for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). It is important to understand the latest best practice guidelines in the treatment and management of patients with NSTE-ACS with a high rate of in-hospital mortality. Physicians must integrate clinical history and examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory findings to accurately diagnose an NSTE-ACS.

178,Anesthetic and other treatments for shell shock: World War I and beyond,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important health risk factor for military personnel serving in modern warfare. During the First World War this condition (known then as shell shock or 'neurasthenia') was such a problem that 'advanced psychiatry' was started by French doctors in 1915. Some British doctors have tried general anesthesia (ether and chloroform) as a treatment. others preferred the electrical application. In 1917 four British 'advanced psychiatric units' were established. Hospitals were established in Britain for soldiers suffering from bullet shock, including Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh (for officers); patients found to have more serious psychiatric conditions were transferred to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. anesthetic and electrical treatments of shock shock, modified Freudian methods were gradually replaced by psychodynamic intervention. The effectiveness of 'advanced psychiatry' was controversial. In 1922 the War Office produced a report on shell shock with recommendations for the prevention of combat neurosis. However, in 1939 the Second World War This seemed to be ignored when World War II broke out. As failure rates became alarming, the term 'battle fatigue' was introduced, and then the value of preselection was recognized.

179,Analgesia and anesthesia for neonates: study design and ethical issues,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to summarize clinical, methodological, and ethical considerations for researchers interested in designing future trials in neonatal analgesia and anesthesia and hope to encourage additional research in this area. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane registry databases were searched using topics related to infant, neonatal, neonatal, analgesia, anesthesia, ethics, and study design. Cross-references and personal files were manually searched. Studies reporting original data or review articles on these topics were reviewed and critically reviewed by experts for each subject area. Data on population demographics, study characteristics, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes were systematically abstracted and synthesized and refined by group members. Data synthesis and results were reviewed by a panel of independent experts and presented to a wider audience, including clinicians, scientists, regulatory staff, and industry representatives, at the Newborn Pharmaceutical Development Initiative workshop. The recommendations were revised after extensive discussion at the workshop and among committee members. CONCLUSIONS: Designing clinical trials to explore new or already existing approaches for analgesia and anesthesia in neonates requires consideration of salient study designs and ethical issues. Conditions requiring treatment include pain/stress from invasive procedures, surgical operations, inflammatory conditions, and routine neonatal intensive care. Study design considerations should describe inclusion and exclusion criteria, a rationale for classification, confounding effects of comorbid conditions, and other clinical factors. Important ethical issues include variability between institutional review boards in examining newborns, obtaining informed consent, performing risk-benefit assessments, defining compensation or rewards for participation, safety considerations, use of placebo controls, and interpreting federal guidelines for human research. . For optimal study design, researchers must formulate well-defined study questions, select appropriate study designs, estimate drug efficacy, calculate sample size, determine duration of studies, determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and avoid drug-drug interactions. Specific outcome measures may include scoring on pain rating scales, various biomarkers and their response patterns, process outcomes (eg, length of stay, time to extubation), medium or long-term outcomes, and safety parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Much more research is needed in this area to formulate a scientifically sound, evidence-based, and clinically useful framework for the management of anesthesia and analgesia in neonates. Newer study designs and additional ethical dilemmas can be identified with the accumulated data in this area.",0,0,
180,Analysis of information submitted by clinical trial sponsors on the safety of investigational drugs,"During the conduct of clinical trials in medical institutions, information on the safety of investigational drugs is provided by trial sponsors in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. In this study, reports of clinical trials conducted at Tokyo University Hospital were reviewed, focusing on safety information provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Two hundred and two reports (52 protocols) on safety information were submitted to the IRB by clinical trial sponsors between April 2000 and March 2001, 185 of which included a total of 3021 adverse event cases. Of these, 194 were decided not to be associated with a significant problem by clinical researchers/physicians and the studies continued. For 157 of these 194 reports, it was considered unnecessary to inform test subjects about report content, including adverse events. The decision on whether to make subjects aware of such content tended to depend on the causal relationship between adverse events and drug intake, as well as the predictability of adverse events. For 8 of these 194 reports, the IRB recommended that clinical investigators/physicians provide information to test subjects and/or provide detailed information about their status to the IRB. Based on these results, we suggest that it is necessary to establish a system to integrate and evaluate drug safety information to ensure safe and efficient clinical trials.",0,0,
181,Angina on the Palm: randomized controlled pilot trial of Palm PDA software for referrals for cardiac testing.,"OBJECTIVE Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are popular with physicians: in 2003, 33% of Canadian physicians reported using them in their practice. However, we do not know whether using a PDA changes the behavior of GPs. We examined the effectiveness of a PDA software application to help family physicians diagnose angina in patients with chest pain. DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled pilot trial using a cluster design. INSTALLATION Basic maintenance practices in the Toronto area. PARTICIPANTS Eighteen family physicians recruited from North Toronto Primary Care Research Network (Nortren) or recruited from a local hospital. INTERVENTIONS We randomized physicians to either receive a Palm PDA (including angina diagnostic software) or continue conventional therapy. Doctors prospectively recorded the care process of patients aged 30-75 years who presented with suspected angina for 7 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Has the care process of patients with suspected angina improved when their physicians had PDAs and software? The primary outcomes we looked at were frequency of cardiac stress testing orders for suspected angina and relevance of referral for cardiac stress testing at presentation and nuclear cardiology testing after cardiac stress testing. The secondary outcome was referred to cardiologists. RESULTS The software led to a more general use of cardiac stress testing (81% vs 50%). The absolute increase was 31% (P = .007, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8% to 58%). There was a trend towards more appropriate use of the stress test (48.6% with PDA and 28.6% control), an increase of 20% (P = .284, 95% CI -11.54 to 51.4%). There was also a trend towards more appropriate use of nuclear cardiology following cardiac stress testing (63.0% vs. 45.5%), with an absolute increase of 17.5% (P = .400, 95% CI -13.9% to 48.9%). Referrals to cardiologists did not increase (38.2% vs. 40.9% with PDA, P = 0.869).

Using the findings to suggest intervention strategies for antimicrobial management in LTCFs. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted. The data were analyzed with thematic content analysis. After the interviews, the emerging findings were matched with the theoretical domain framework (TDF) and the behavior modification wheel and behavior modification technique (BCT) classification were used to recommend future intervention strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted with 37 healthcare professionals working at LTCFs (10 general practitioners, 4 consultants, 14 nurses, 9 pharmacists) between December 2012 and March 2013. RESULTS: The main areas emerging from TDF were: 'Knowledge', 'Environmental context and resources', 'Social influences', 'Beliefs about outcomes', 'Memory, attention and decision making'; 'Behavior regulation'. Many participants believed that antibiotic prescribing was satisfactory in their LTCF despite the lack of surveillance activities. CONCLUSIONS: Using the TDF and BCT taxonomy, this study found that antibiotic prescription in LTCFs is influenced by many social and contextual factors. The challenges of the setting and the patient population, beliefs about patient outcomes, and the failure to implement guidelines and information regarding antibiotic prescribing patterns are significant challenges that need to be addressed. Based on the study findings and the application of TDF and BCT taxonomy, we propose some practical intervention functions for antimicrobial management in LTCFs.",0,0,
184,antibiotic resistance,Resistance to antibiotics is economically and physiologically costly. Controlling antibiotic resistance will require the aggressive implementation of multiple strategies. Continuous surveillance is required to monitor known antibiotic types and identify the development of other potential types. Early intervention is needed to combat the rising rate of resistance. The continued use of hygiene measures and the controlled use of antibiotics will limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. Health care providers need to monitor compliance with control measures. Hand and environmental control measures remain a critical component of staff training activities. Active management of infections with non-pharmacological treatments should be encouraged. Motivational campaigns will reinforce positive infection control behaviors. Consistent surveillance of antibiotic use will help meet the CDC directive to combat antibiotic resistance and keep the population healthy.,0,0,

186,"Antimalarial prescribing patterns in public and selected parastatal hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria","OBJECTIVE: Malaria is a treatable and preventable disease and is an important public health problem in Nigeria. Chloroquine was the first-line drug in its treatment until recently in Nigeria, where Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs) were introduced. Inappropriate prescribing, that is, not prescribing drugs according to scientific evidence-based guidelines to ensure safe, effective and economical use, is an irrational drug use behavior. The increased benefits or slowing of progression to resistance from chloroquine can be achieved by improving prescribing practice, drug quality, and patient compliance. OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimalarial prescribing pattern and evaluate rational chloroquine prescribing by prescribers at public hospitals and parastatals in Lagos State. METHODS: The study was conducted using patient prescriptions at all ten government General Hospitals under the Lagos Public Hospitals Board (now the Lagos State Health Services Commission), a parastatal hospital and an oil company clinic. One hundred prescriptions each for adults and children were systematically sampled for each month for one year (January-December 2000). When there were fewer than 100 prescriptions in a month, all available prescriptions were sampled for analysis. RESULTS: The mean number of drugs per encounter in all hospitals was 4,259 +/- 0.009. The average number of injections per encounter was 1,215 +/- 0.009. Approximately 48.5% of all prescriptions had at least one injection, while 40.9% of prescriptions had dipyrone injection. The average drug cost per encounter was N147.40 +/- 0.765. The percentage of exposure to chloroquine was 82.5%, followed by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 14.2%. The proportion of prescriptions with the correct chloroquine dose was 47.5%. CONCLUSION: Polypharmacy is available in all hospitals. The average number of drugs per encounter was above 4 for most hospitals. Less than half of the prescriptions had the right dose of chloroquine. This study may serve as a basis for irrational prescribing intervention.",0,0,
187,Antioxidant vitamin supplement for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases,"Oxidative stress, particularly oxidative modification of LDL-cholesterol, appears to be of great importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Several observational epidemiological studies have suggested that antioxidant vitamin intake is associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, experimental studies on animals have shown that antioxidant vitamins slow the progression of atherosclerosis. However, prospective controlled clinical trials failed to demonstrate a benefit of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the use of antioxidants and vitamin supplements as a preventive or therapeutic intervention cannot be recommended.",0,0,

189,Antipsychotic polypharmacy in schizophrenia: benefits and risks,"Antipsychotic polypharmacy refers to the simultaneous prescription of more than one antipsychotic medication for a single patient. Prescribing studies in international psychiatric services have identified relatively frequent and consistent use of combined antipsychotics, often for people with established schizophrenia, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some clinical settings. A common reason for prescribing more than one antipsychotic is to achieve a greater or more rapid therapeutic response than is achieved with antipsychotic monotherapy. However, the evidence about the risks and benefits of such a strategy is unclear and is generally not considered sufficient to warrant a recommendation for its use in routine clinical practice in psychiatry. Combined antipsychotics are a major contributor to high-dose prescribing in conjunction with an increased burden of adverse events and are of limited value in helping to establish the optimal maintenance regimen for a patient. The relatively widespread use of antipsychotic polypharmacy identified in cross-sectional studies reflects not only the addition of a second antipsychotic to enhance therapeutic response, but also the use of gradual cross-titration of antipsychotic drugs as needed (mainly to treat disturbed behavior). switching from one antipsychotic to another and augmentation of clozapine with a second antipsychotic when the disease does not respond adequately to an optimized trial of clozapine. This review considers clinical trial data and other evidence for each of these pharmacological approaches. Examples of systematic, practice-based interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy were also reviewed, many of which met with only modest success. Guidelines generally agree that if combined antipsychotics are prescribed to treat resistant psychotic illness, this should happen after other evidence-based pharmacological treatments such as clozapine have been exhausted. Also, their prescription for each patient should be in an individual research context, with monitoring of clinical response and side effects, and appropriate physical health monitoring.",0,0,
190,Hospital control application to nebulizer use: Example of Hotel-Dieu de France-Lebanon,"PROBLEM: The aim of the study was to reduce unfair prescriptions of nebulized therapy to comply with international guidelines and reduce healthcare costs. METHODS: DESIGN: We conducted a controlled, prospective study to evaluate the impact of local guidelines aimed at improving physicians' behavior on compliance and costs of administration. BACKGROUND AND ENVIRONMENT: All departments of a university hospital: medical and surgical wards, intensive care units, emergency rooms and one-day admission units. KEY MEASURE FOR CHANGE: Reduction in the number of inappropriate nebulized therapy prescriptions. STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: The app included two training presentations, banners in all departments, emails to all doctors and assistants, and a reassessment of the prescription one week later. RESULTS: Pre-intervention, inappropriate prescription rate was 11.9% (42/358 of nebulizer-treated patients had no indication for this treatment and 3/19 had nebulization indications but untreated)”; “post-intervention , the inappropriate prescription rate was 14.6% (15.7% of patients with no indication for treatment, but no patients with an indication for treatment and no untreated), reflecting that the intervention had no significant effect. CONCLUSION: The simple presentation of clinical guidelines did not lead to a change in medical practice. Another approach is needed to effectively improve this outcome.",0,0,
191,Application of MAT-CHDSP to evaluate guideline adherence and therapy target success in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have documented optimal non-compliance with guideline recommendations for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD(CP)). Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) aimed at reducing the risk of morbidity and death are continually being developed to define appropriate patient care. The Drug Evaluation Tool for CHD(SP) (MAT-CHD(SP)) was developed to assess adherence to CPGs related to drug therapy and follow-up of CHD(SP) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether MAT-CHD(SP) could be applied retrospectively to evaluate guideline adherence and therapy target success in secondary prevention of CHD. METHODS: We collected data from electronic medical records of all patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation (n = 300) between January and March 2008 and performed MAT-CHD(SP). We measured the time for data collection and MAT implementation, and tested reproducibility by calculating Cohen's kappa (kappa) value for interobserver and interobserver agreement. RESULTS: A total of 247 MAT applications were analyzed (intraobserver and interobserver kappa values 0.93 and 0.95), showing the overall applicability of 66% of the 4,446 MAT-CHD(SP) criteria and the high reproducibility of the MAT-CHD(SP) application. agreement, respectively). The mean time for data collection and MAT-CHD(SP) application was 11 minutes. Compliance with prescription criteria was high (>75%), but achievement of treatment goals for cholesterol and blood pressure was low (<50%). Documentation of lifestyle recommendations provided moderate (50-75%) or low compliance, as did therapy changes, in patients whose therapy goals were not met at hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: MAT-CHD(SP) provides a tool to determine both adherence and non-adherence to CPGs related to CHD(SP) and identifies potentials for improved patient care and applicable in retrospective evaluation of CHD(SP).",0,0,
192,Applying theory to develop supervisory and feedback interventions to increase adoption of evidence-based transfusion practice: an intervention development protocol,"BACKGROUND: Blood transfusion controls show that approximately 20% transfusion is outside of national recommendations and guidelines. Supervision and feedback is a widely used quality improvement intervention, but the effects on clinical practice are variable and suggest potential for improvement. Behavioral theory, theoretical frameworks of behavior change, and behavior change techniques provide systematic processes for improving intervention. This work is part of a broader program of work to promote the adoption of evidence-based transfusion practice. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to design two theoretically developed control and feedback interventions"";"" one focuses on content, the other on delivery and explores feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: Study A (Content): A coding framework based on available evidence on audit and feedback and behavior change theory and frameworks will be developed and implemented as part of a structured content analysis to identify key components of existing feedback documents. Prototype feedback documents with enhanced content will be developed, as well as a protocol describing the principles for developing feedback content. Study B (Delivery): Individual semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and observations of team meetings at four hospitals will be used to identify and identify views on current monitoring and feedback practice. Interviews will be based on a subject guide developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Consolidated Framework for Practice Research. Analysis of transcripts based on these frameworks will establish the evidence base for developing a protocol describing an improved intervention focused on feedback delivery. Study C (Feasibility and Acceptability): Advanced interventions will be trialled at four hospitals. Semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and observations will be used to assess feasibility and acceptability. DISCUSSION: This intervention development study reflects UK Medical Research Council guidance on the development of complex interventions, which emphasizes the importance of a solid theoretical basis for intervention design and recommends systematic evaluation of feasibility and acceptability before undertaking a full-scale evaluation of interventions. randomized trial. The study includes the specification of current practice so that, in future trials in this program, there is a clear distinction between control (usual practice) conditions and interventions to be evaluated.",0,0,
193,Applying Election Architecture Principles to Understanding HIV Testing: Findings from Malawi and Zimbabwe,"World Health Organization-led advances in prenatal HIV counseling in sub-Saharan Africa from 2004 to 2011 saw a parallel increase in HIV testing. We sought to determine the extent to which the use of choice architecture principles (which by default provides an opt-out) influences HIV testing uptake, above and beyond individual-level attitudes and cognitions. Population and Health Survey data collected between 2004 and 2011 from Zimbabwe (N = 1330) and Malawi (N = 4.043) countries, where more than 10% of adults are HIV-infected, were analyzed. We investigated the impact of demographic variables, forms of knowledge about HIV, stigma towards people living with HIV, attitudes towards spousal abuse, and whether HIV testing should be recommended during prenatal visits. The results showed that structural-level support was the strongest predictor of HIV testing above and beyond individual-level attitudes and cognitions, accounting for secular trends in higher testing rates.

194,Behavioral economics-based approaches can help drive patients and providers to lower healthcare expenditure growth.,"Policies that change the environment or context in which decisions are made and that “push” people into certain choices have been relatively overlooked in health care. This article examines the role that behavioral economics-based approaches can play in ""nudge"" providers and patients in ways that could slow the growth of healthcare spending. The basic insight of behavioral economics is that behavior is driven by the very fallible human brain and is heavily influenced by the environment or context in which choices are made. In policy areas such as retirement and personal savings, approaches based on behavioral economics have produced remarkable results. In healthcare, such approaches have been used in successful but limited ways, such as in the use of surgical checklists that increase patient safety and reduce costs. With healthcare spending rising at unsustainable rates, we review the role that behavioral economics-based approaches can play in providing policymakers with a potential set of new tools to slow spending growth.",0,1,
195,Architectural frameworks: defining structures for the implementation of learning health systems,"Background The vision to transform health systems into learning health systems (LHSs) that rapidly and consistently transform knowledge into improved health outcomes at lower cost is generating increased interest in government agencies, health care organizations, and the health research community. While current initiatives have shown that different approaches can be successful in making the LHS vision a reality, their objectives, focus and scale are too diverse to be reproduced without undue effort. Indeed, the necessary structures to effectively design and implement LHSs on a larger scale are lacking. In this paper, we propose using architectural frameworks to develop LHSs that adhere to a recognized vision while adapting to their specific organizational context. Architectural frameworks are high-level descriptions of an organization as a system"";"" They capture the structure of its main components at various levels, the interrelationships between these components, and the principles that guide their evolution. Because these frameworks support the analysis of LHSs and allow their results to be simulated, they act as pre-implementation decision support tools that identify potential barriers and systems improvement possibilities. Thus, they increase the chances of successful LHS deployment. Discussion We present an architectural framework for LHSs that combines the five-dimensional objectives commonly found in the LHS literature: scientific, social, technical, and ethical. The proposed architectural framework consists of six decision layers that model these dimensions. The performance layer models the objectives, scientific layer scientific dimension, organization layer social dimension, data layer and information technology layer technical dimension, ethics and security layer ethical dimension. We define the types of decisions that need to be made at each layer and determine the methods to support decision making. Conclusion In this paper, we outline a high-level architectural framework based on the conceptual and empirical LHS literature. Because the application of this architectural framework allows for a clear and critical understanding of the types of decisions that underlie LHS operations, it can guide the development and implementation of new LHSs and the evolution of existing ones. More research is needed to evaluate and improve its generalizability and methods.",0,0,
196,Are non-specific application guidelines potentially harmful? A randomized comparison of the impact of non-specific and specific guidelines on physician decision making.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of two different clinical practice guideline formats to influence the physician's order of electrodiagnostic testing for low back pain. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of practice guidelines on physician-reported test ordering behavior in response to a set of 12 clinical short stories. The data came from a random national sample of 900 US neurologists, physical medicine doctors, and general internists. INTERVENTION: Two versions of a practice guide to the use of electrodiagnostic testing (EDT) have been developed by the US Healthcare Policy and Low Back Research Panel. The two guides were similar in content but differed in the originality of their recommendations. DATA COLLECTION: The proportion of clinical histories for which EDTs were ordered for appropriate and ineligible clinical indications in each of the three physician groups were randomly assigned to receive stories only, short stories plus non-specific version of the guideline, or stories plus a specific version of the guideline. instruction. KEY FINDINGS: The response rate to the survey was 71 percent. The proportion of eligible vignettes for which EDTs were ordered averaged 77 percent for the non-guided group, 71 percent for the non-specific guide group, and 79 percent for the specific guide group (p = .002). The corresponding values for the number of EDTs ordered for ineligible vignettes are 32 percent, 32 percent, and 26 percent, respectively (p = .08). Pairwise comparisons showed that physicians who received non-specific guidelines ordered fewer EDTs for appropriate clinical vignettes than physicians who did not (p = .02). Also, compared with physicians receiving non-specific guidelines, physicians receiving specific guidelines ordered significantly more EDT (p = .0007) for appropriate vignettes and significantly less EDT (p = .04) for inappropriate vignettes. CONCLUSIONS: The clarity and clinical applicability of a guideline can be important attributes that contribute to the effectiveness of practice guidelines.",0,0,

198,Are Psychiatric Crisis Assessment and Treatment team clinicians at the forefront of psychotherapy?,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited data on psychological interventions used by Crisis Evaluation and Treatment (CAT) team clinicians, although practice guidelines mandate some of their role as providing counselling. This study aimed to catalog and categorize the types of psychotherapeutic interventions used by clinicians of a CAT team operating in a metropolitan area. METHODS: Self-report and care-episode data were collected regarding clinicians' views on the type of psychotherapeutic intervention they administered and details of what they talked to patients, and the location and duration of interventions. RESULTS: Thirty-two maintenance departments were cataloged. On average, clinicians spent 74% of their total contact time with patients engaged in psychological interventions. A wide range of strategies, drawn from a broad theoretical foundation, were used. In addition to general approaches that aid participation, interventions can be classified into the following categories: meta-strategy ('therapeutic treatment'), 'critical', 'practical', specific psychotherapeutic (cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and others), and supportive. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians viewed themselves as preoccupied with psychological interventions that drew from a broad theoretical basis most of the time in patient contact. Observational studies of what clinicians actually do and empirical investigation of their effectiveness can have implications for clinician training and supervision.",0,0,

200,Are we adequately preparing the next generation of physicians to prescribe exercise as prevention and treatment? Residents express desire for more training in exercise prescription,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is an important intervention for chronic disease, but few physicians provide exercise prescriptions (EP). EP is a key component in larger strategies to reduce noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Our aim was to evaluate the knowledge, competency and EP perspectives of Family Medicine Residents (FMRs) to help inform future curriculum development. METHODS: A 49-item cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to 396 University of British Columbia FMRs. EP knowledge, competence, attitudes/beliefs, current practices, personal physical activity levels and educational perspectives of the residents were first evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS: The response rate was 80.6% (319/396). After eliminating 25 that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 294 were included in the final analysis. Majority 95.6% of FMRs had EP' despite having low knowledge of Canadian PA Guidelines (mean score 1.77/4) and low proficiency in prescribing exercise as prevention (mean score 13.35/21). reported that it is important in future applications. they consider themselves ""slightly inadequate"" and recommend exercise to patients with chronic disease (mean score 11.26/21). FMR believes that PA is an integral part of their patients' health (98.0%), sedentary behavior is harmful (97.9%), and is responsible for discussing PA with patients (99.7%). Few FMRs (14.9%) perceived their training in EP as adequate and 91.0% wanted more. CONCLUSIONS: The FMR report EP is important, but they do not feel sufficiently prepared to provide EP. In future curriculum development, medical educators should consider residents' low knowledge, competence, perceived program support, and expressed desire for more training in exercise prescription.",0,0,

The initial goals were (1) to propose a new classification of allergic rhinitis and (2) to promote the concept of multiple morbidity in asthma. and rhinitis and (3) develop guidelines with all stakeholders that can be used globally for all countries and populations. ARIA—disseminated and implemented in more than 70 countries around the world—now focuses on the application of emerging technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK [MACVIA (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Active)-ARIA Sentinel NetworK] uses mobile technology to develop ways of care for the treatment of rhinitis and asthma by a multidisciplinary group and by patients themselves. An app (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analog scale to evaluate symptom control and work productivity, as well as a clinical decision support system. It is associated with an interoperable tablet for doctors and other healthcare professionals. The scaling strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Aging. The aim of the new ARIA approach is to provide rhinitis patients with an active and healthy life, regardless of age, gender or socio-economic status, in order to reduce health and social inequalities caused by the disease.",0,0,
202,Arriba: effects of an educational intervention on prescribing behavior in CVD prevention in general practice,"BACKGROUND: Evidence on the effectiveness of educational interventions in prescribing behavior change in the prevention of cardiovascular disease is still insufficient. We evaluated the effects of a brief educational intervention on prescribing hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), platelet aggregation inhibitors (IPA), and antihypertensive agents (AH). DESIGN: Clustered randomized controlled trial with continuing medical education (CME) groups of general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: Statins, IPA, and AH prescriptions were validated before study entry (BL), immediately after index consultation (IC), and at 6 months follow-up (FU). Prescribing in high-risk patients (>15% cardiovascular event risk at 10 years according to the Framingham equation) and non-prescribing in low-risk patients (</= 15%) were considered appropriate. RESULTS: Prescribing interference effect can be found only for IPA. Overall, changes in prescription over time were all directed towards higher prescription rates and persisted FU regardless of risk status and group allocation. CONCLUSIONS: Active implementation of a brief evidence-based educational intervention on global risk in CVD did not directly result in risk-adjusted changes in prescription. Research over an extended time scale will reveal whether such decision support can improve prescribing in a risk-adjusted sustainable way.",0,0,

204,"Evaluation of the availability of scientific journals, databases and health library services in Canadian ministries of health: a cross-sectional study.","Background Evidence-based health policy-making logically depends on timely access to research evidence. To our knowledge, there are no studies addressing the availability of peer-reviewed research in Canadian ministries of health, despite significant political and societal pressure to improve the use of the best available research evidence in public health policy and program decision-making. Objectives To assess the availability of (1) high-ranking scholarly journals in fourteen Canadian ministries of health, (2) bibliographic databases, and (3) a purpose-built sample of health library services. Methods Between May and October 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among librarians employed by Canadian health ministries to gather information on the availability of scholarly journals, bibliographic databases, and health library services. Availability of scientific journals in each ministry was determined using a sample of 48 journals selected from the 2009 Journal Citation Reports (Sciences and Social Sciences Editions). The selection criteria were: health policy based on coverage grade information on subject categories and journal popularity based on impact factors. Results We found that the majority of Canadian ministries of health do not have subscription access to major journals and rely heavily on interlibrary loans. Overall, based on a sample of highly ranked scholarly journals, the availability of journals through interlibrary loan, online, and print-only subscriptions were estimated at 63%, 28%, and 3%, respectively. Health Canada had 2.3 times more magazine subscriptions than the average for state ministries. Most organizations have access to multiple discipline-specific and multi-disciplinary databases. Many organizations have access to library resources disclosed through library partnerships or consortia. Four of the fourteen Canadian ministries of health (i.e. Manitoba Health, Northwest Territories Department of Health and Social Services, Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services, and Yukon Department of Health and Social Services) failed to find a professionally managed health library setting. Conclusions There is disparity in the availability of peer-reviewed research across fourteen Canadian ministries of health. This inequality can be a problem, as each province and territory is responsible for formulating and implementing evidence-based health policies and services for the benefit of its own population.",0,0,
205,Evaluation of the impact of national guidelines in the management of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis,"BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is a common disease with annual hospitalizations amounting to $500 million. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and treatment are variable. To address this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after the publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in two academic medical centers of children younger than 24 months old admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of primary or secondary bronchiolitis discharge. Pre-guideline charts were collected from 2004 to 2005 and post-guideline charts from 2007 to 2008. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions before and during hospitalization were analyzed. Data were analyzed using chi-square analysis for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Diagnostic laboratory testing rates did not decline after the guideline was published. The number of chest X-rays obtained decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% after guidelines (P = 0.02). Fewer children received a trial of racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P < 0.0001) after guidelines, and physicians more frequently reported ineffectiveness postoperatively. They stopped albuterol. -rules period (78.9% vs. 28.6%, P < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use decreased after guidelines in children without a history of RAD or asthma (17.5% versus 26.5%, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Modest change in physician behavior was seen in the inpatient treatment of bronchiolitis after the guidelines.

206,As usual evaluation of treatment provided to control groups in adjustment trials: An investigation of the use of an open-ended questionnaire to identify behavior change techniques.,"OBJECTIVE: Reporting guidelines require definitions of control group support in equal detail as for interventions. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate the active ingredient of the usual treatment (TAU) given to control groups in trials (behavior modification techniques (BCTs)). The aim of this study is to pretest a method for assessing TAU in a multicenter cost-effectiveness trial of an HIV adherence intervention. DESIGN: HIV nurses (N = 21) completed a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire asking TAU about compliance counseling. The two encoders independently encoded the BCTs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The completeness and clarity of nurse responses, intercoder reliability, and the type of BCTs reported were examined. RESULTS: The clarity and completeness of nurse responses were sufficient. Twenty-three of the 26 identified BCTs could be reliably coded (mean kappa = .79"";"" mean agreement rate = 96%), and three BCTs scored below kappa = .60. The total number of BCTs reported per nurse ranged from 7 to 19 (Mean = 13.86, SD = 3.35). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the TAU open-ended questionnaire is a viable and reliable tool to capture the context of active support provided to control participants in a multicenter compliance intervention trial.

Clinician involvement is vital to provide guidance and assistance to patients who are overweight or obese to address the underlying cause of many chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To describe current best practices for obesity assessment and lifestyle management and to demonstrate how the Updated Guidelines for Managing Overweight and Obesity in Adults (2013) are based on a systematic review of evidence supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). ) may be administered to an individual patient. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic review of evidence for the Adult Guide to Managing Overweight and Obesity (2013) supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, benefits of weight loss, diets for weight loss, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches, and bariatric surgery)""; Recommendations for fields outside of Bariatric Physicians are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, the 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those from Canadian and US professional associations such as the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations , 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans); a PubMed study identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity, motivational interviewing for weight management, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and obesity pharmacotherapy step in obesity management. is to scan in terms of beziness. A medical history should be taken assessing multiple determinants of obesity, including diet and physical activity patterns, psychosocial factors, weight gain medications, and familial characteristics. Emphasizing the complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit most from treatment is more helpful than using body mass index (calculated in Kilograms divided by height squared height) alone for treatment decisions. Guidelines (2013) recommend that clinicians offer intensive, multi-component behavioral intervention to patients who would benefit from weight loss (either with or without comorbidities BMI >/=30 or >/=25 and 1 comorbidity or risk factor). Some clinicians do this within their primary care practice; “others refer patients for these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through modification of food and physical activity behaviors. Guidelines (2013) support comprehensive lifestyle therapy with intensive intervention. Treatment is available in a clinician's office or to a registered dietitian or commercial weight Weight loss of 5% to 10% is the usual goal. Patients need not have a body mass index of less than 25 to 25.

OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a clinical trial conducted to test the effectiveness of a joint program supported by an electronic platform between primary care teams and specialists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Doctors from four community hospitals belonging to the Reloncavi Health Service network recruited 81 depressed patients aged 37 to 43, 84% of whom were women. Participants were divided into an active group participating in the joint program and a control group receiving usual care, according to the Department of Health's Depression Guidelines. The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) score at three months of intervention. RESULTS: Participants had a mean score of 29.6 (95% CI: 27.6-31.6) on the BDI-I, and 38% had a high risk of suicide. There were no statistically significant baseline differences between the active and control groups. In the intervention group, the BDI-I score changed from 30.0 (95% CI 27.0 to 32.8) to 15.3 (95% CI 11.8 to 18.8). In the control group, the score changed from 29.2 (95% CI: 26.4-31.9) to 20.8 (95% CI 16.8 to 24.7). The reduction was significantly higher in the intervention groups.

The efficacy of P4P is uncertain, although some reviews have reported significant effects. Purpose: To evaluate changes in performance after a participant initiates a P4P program. Design: An observational study with pre- and post-measurement. Setting and topics: Sixty-five general practices in the south of the Netherlands. Intervention: A targeted user-designed P4P program with indicators for chronic care, prevention, practice management, and patient experience (GP [GP] functioning and organization of care). Quality indicators were calculated for each application. A maximum bonus of €6890 per 1000 patients was determined by comparing the performance of the application with a benchmark. Key outcome measures: Quality indicators for clinical care (process and outcome) and patient experience. Results: We included 60 applications. After 1 year, significant improvement in process indicators was demonstrated for all chronic conditions, ranging from +7.9% improvement for cardiovascular risk management to +11.5% for asthma. Five outcome indicators improved significantly, as well as patients' experience with the GP's functioning and care organization. There were no significant improvements in the influenza vaccination rate and uptake of cervical cancer screening. Clinical process and outcome indicators and patient experience indicators were affected by baseline measures. Smaller apps showed more improvement. Conclusions: A participatory P4P program can promote quality improvement in clinical care and improve GP functioning and organization of care and patient experiences.

210,Evaluation of decision support for blood test ordering in primary care. a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Different methods have proven effective in changing the behavior of requesting blood tests in primary care. However, randomized studies comparing these methods are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of two versions of BloodLink, a computer-based clinical decision support system, on blood test ordering among GPs. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: 44 GP practices in Delft, Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 60 GPs in 44 practices using computer-based patient records in their practice. INTERVENTION: After stratification with solo practices and group practices, apps were randomly assigned to use either the BloodLink-Restricted or the BloodLink-Guideline based on the Dutch College of General Practitioners' guidelines, which initially showed a reduced test list. MEASUREMENTS: Average number of blood tests ordered per order form per application. RESULTS: GPs using BloodLink-Guideline required 20% fewer tests on average than doctors using BloodLink-Restricted (mean [+/-SD], 5.5 +/- 0.9 tests, and 6.9 +/- 1.6 tests)"" ;"" P = 0.003, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines-based decision support is more effective in changing blood test requesting behavior than decision support based on limited initial screening of tests. Guideline-based decision support systems can be effective in reducing the number of laboratory tests required by primary care practitioners.",1,1,
211,Evaluation of the effects of radiological referral and computer-based guidelines on radiological requests in two emergency departments.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medical emergency radiology referral practice against a set of French guidelines and to measure the effectiveness of computer-based guidelines on unnecessary medical imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All radiological requests were computerized in the medical emergency departments of two French teaching hospitals. During the control periods, radiological requests were recorded, but no action was taken. During the intervention periods, on-screen reminder displays indicate appropriate recommendations. Three control and three intervention periods of 1 month each were performed. The percentage of requests that did not comply with the guidelines and variations in control and intervention periods were measured. RESULTS: The rate of requests that do not comply with the guidelines was 33Â·2% when the guidelines were ineffective, and decreased to 26Â·9% when the recommendations were active (P < 0Â·0001). Three imaging studies (chest radiographs, plain abdominal radiographs, and CT of the brain) accounted for more than 80% of all requests""; more than 50% of requests for plain abdominal radiographs did not comply with recommendations, compared to 24Â·9, respectively. Chest radiographs and computerized brain % and 15Â·8 for tomography (CT). Seven conditions accounted for 70% of ineligible radiological referrals, in which cases the knowledge of young practitioners was insufficient. CONCLUSION: The effect of our intervention simultaneously with care, tailored to the needs of individual patients when giving computer advice However, our study identified several conditions responsible for most of the unnecessary radiological demands, and we hope this result may help clinicians and radiologists develop more specific actions for these conditions.Karton, M. et al.

212,Evaluation of self-harm in an accident and emergency room - development of a pro forma to assess suicidal intent and mental status in emergency room presenters with self-harm,"INTRODUCTION: The United Kingdom has one of the highest rates of self-harm in Europe, with around 400 per 100,000 people (Horrocks et al. 2002). It is responsible for 150,000 visits to the Emergency department each year and is one of the top five reasons for acute medical admissions in the UK (NICE 2002). OBJECTIVES: Objectives including self-harm method and to investigate demographic factors of patients presenting to the Emergency department with self-harm. In addition, we wanted to investigate the suicide risk factors and suicidal intention by the emergency room doctor and, when deemed necessary, refer to the psychiatry services and investigate whether a psychiatric evaluation is performed with a full mental state examination. We wanted to explore current practice regarding self-harm presentations in the ER in accordance with NICE guidelines. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively between February and August 2009. Twenty-five sets of medical notes were randomly compiled for patients presenting to the emergency department with self-harm. Notes were reviewed for event investigation, psychiatric evaluation, risk factors for suicide, and further referral. RESULTS: 14 of 25 patients presented with an overdose. 9 had caused another form of self-harm, namely, self-tearing. A mixed presentation was found in 2 cases. Prior psychiatric history was documented in 16 cases. 11 of them had a previous history of depression or anxiety disorder"", 1 was known to have bipolar mood disorder, 1 had a previous diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and 3 patients had no previous history. No previous history was documented in 9 cases. DISCUSSION : Twenty-five sets of medical notes were reviewed for individuals presenting to the emergency department with self-harm between February and August 2009. Of these, 12 were over 25 years old, 17 were female, and 8 were male. The majority of patients were of white British ethnicity. 14 had overdosed; 9 had otherwise self-harmed;"" and 2 of them gave a mixed presentation. Suicidal risk factors and suicidal intent were poorly documented by mental state examination, which was undocumented in all 25 cases reviewed. Eighteen of them were deemed medically fit in the emergency room and were referred for psychiatric examination. These unfortunate findings may be a reflection of the time pressure faced by ED doctors, namely the lack of adequate training in four-hour targets and perhaps psychosocial risk assessment. With such poor documentation by emergency room doctors, a pro forma was produced that included an assessment of suicide risk factors and suicidal intent, in addition to a short version of the mental state examination. CONCLUSION: The Royal College of Psychiatrists' latest report on self-harm has raised concerns that the current level of care provided to service users, with inadequate assessments, unskilled staff and inadequate means of care, remains below the standards set in policies and guidelines (Royal College of Psychiatrists. Report CR 158). .2010). Indeed, evidence indicates that appropriate training and intervention given to A&E personnel can lead to improvements in the quality of the psychosocial assessment of patients who intentionally self-harm (Crawford et al. 1998).",0,0,
213,Evaluation of the potential effect of a reminder system on reducing diagnostic errors: a quasi-experimental study.,"Background Computerized decision support systems (DSS) are mainly focused on improving the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in unusual and challenging situations. However, as diagnostic omission errors can predominantly result from incomplete studies in routine clinical practice, providing appropriate patient and context-specific reminders may result in a greater impact on patient safety. In this experimental study, a mix of easy and hard simulated cases was used to evaluate the impact of a new diagnostic reminder system (ISABEL) on the quality of clinical decisions made by clinicians of varying degrees during acute assessment. Methods Subjects of varying degrees (counselors, registrants, senior home clerks, and medical students) evaluated a balanced set of 24 simulated cases on a trial website. Subjects recorded their clinical decisions (differential diagnosis, test ordering, and treatment) for the cases before and after the systems consultation. A panel of two pediatric counselors independently provided gold standard responses for each case in which the quality of subjects' decisions was measured. The primary outcome measure was the change in the number of diagnostic omission errors (DEO). A more precise assessment of the system's impact was obtained using specific quality scores""; additional consultation time resulting from the use of KDS was also calculated. Results 76 subjects (18 counselors, 24 registrants, 19 senior housekeepers, and 15 students) completed a total of 751 cases. sections. The mean number of DEOs decreased from 5.5 to 5.0 in all subjects (repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.001), no significant interaction with subject grade. The mean diagnostic quality score increased after system counseling (0.044; 95% confidence interval 0.032, 0.054). ISABEL reminded subjects to consider at least one clinically significant diagnosis in 1 out of 8 cases and asked them to order a major test in 1 out of 10 cases. The median extra time for DSS consultation was 1 minute (IQR: 30 seconds to 2 minutes). Conclusion The provision of patient- and context-specific reminders has the potential to reduce diagnostic deficits at all course grades for a number of cases. This study suggests a promising role for future use of reminder-based DSS in reducing diagnostic error.",0,1,
214,The Relationship Between Academic Medical Center Drug Detailing Policies and Doctor Prescribing,"In an effort to regulate physicians' conflicts of interest, some U.S. academic medical centers (AMCs) enacted policies restricting drug representative sales (known as detailing) to physicians between 2006 and 2012. Little is known about the impact of these policies on doctor prescribing. . The aim is to analyze the relationship between the detailed policies enacted in AMCs and the doctor's prescription of actively detailed and non-detailed drugs. Design, Setting, and Participants The study used multivariate regression analysis of difference in differences to compare changes in prescribing by physicians before and after the implementation of detailing policies in AMCs in 5 states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York). formed the intervention group with changes in prescribing by a matched control group of similar physicians who were not subject to a detailed policy. Exposures Academic medical center implementation of policies governing the pharmaceutical salesperson's visits to relevant physicians. Key Outcomes and Precautions Intra-pharmaceutical market share of prescriptions written by a single physician for detailed and non-detailed drugs in 8 drug classes (approved for lipid-lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs, diabetes drugs, antihypertensive drugs, hypnotic drugs) is 10 before the implementation of monthly detailing policies. - Comparison of the 36-month period with the 12-36-month period after administration, treatment of insomnia [sleeping medications], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, antidepressant drugs, and antipsychotic drugs), depending on data availability. Results The analysis included 16?121?483 prescriptions written by 2126 specialist physicians and 24?593 matched control group physicians in 19 intervention group AMCs between January 2006 and June 2012. The sample mean market share at the physician-drug-month level for detailed and non-detailed drugs prior to the entry into force of the policies was 19.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Exposure to an AMC detailing policy was associated with an increase in market share of 1.67 percentage points (95% CI, ?2.18 to ?1.18 points""; P?<?.001) for detailed drugs. Undetailed 0.84% percentage points ratio of drugs (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.14 points; P?<?.001) Associations were statistically significant for 6 of the 8 study drug classes for detailed drugs (lipid-lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs). antihypertensive drugs, sleep aids, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs, and antidepressant drugs) and for 9 out of 19 AMCs enforcing policies, 11 of 19 AMCs arranged salesperson gifts to doctors, restricted salesperson access to facilities, and explicitly included Enforcement mechanisms There was a significant change in prescribing for 8 of these 11 AMCs In contrast, there was a significant change in only 1 out of 8 AMCs that did not implement policy in all 3 areas e AMCs between 2006 and 2012 implementation of policies restricting pharmaceutical detailing was associated with modest but significant reductions in prescribing of detail drugs in 6 of 8 major drug classes; however, no change was seen in all AMCs enforcing policies.",0,0,

Objective Compare time to suicide with efavirenz-containing and non-efavirenz antiretroviral regimens for initial treatment of HIV. Design Participant-level data were analyzed from four AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) antiretroviral-naive studies conducted from 2001 to 2010. In each study, participants were randomly assigned to either an efavirenz-containing (n=3241) or no efavirenz group. regimen (n=2091). Adjustment of ACTG sites""; 74% registered in the United States. Patients Antiretroviral inexperienced participants. Intervention Efavirenz and efavirenz-free regimens. Measures Suicide was defined as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or completed suicide. Groups were compared with a hazard ratio ( HR ) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated from a Cox model classified by the study. 73% of the results were male, the median age was 37 years; 32% had documented psychiatric history or had taken psychoactive medication within 30 days of starting the study. Median follow-up was 96 weeks. The incidence of suicides per 1000 person-years was 8.08 (47 events) in the efavirenz group and 3.66 (15 events) in the efavirenz-free group, HR: 2.28 (95% CI: 1.27 to 4.10, p=0.006). The incidence of suicide attempt or completed suicide was 2.90 (17 events) and 1.22 (5 events) in the efavirenz and efavirenz-free groups, respectively, HR: 2.58 (95% CI: 0.94 to 7.06, p= 0.065). Eight suicide deaths were reported in the efavirenz group and one in the efavirenz-free group. Limitations There was no standardized questionnaire regarding suicidal ideation or attempt. Efavirenz was open-label in three of the four studies. Results Initial treatment with an efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimen was associated with twice the risk of suicide compared to an efavirenz-free regimen.

216,Association of a Low-Frequency Variant in HNF1A with Type 2 Diabetes in the Latino Population,"Importance Latino populations have one of the highest prevalences of type 2 diabetes worldwide. Objectives To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to explore potential molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed associations. Design, Placement and Participants Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3756 Mexican and US Latino individuals (1794 with type 2 diabetes and 1962 without diabetes) recruited from 1993 to 2013. Type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic datasets of 14?276 participants characterized by experimental analysis. Main Conclusion and Measures Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary outcomes included age at onset, body mass index, and effect on protein function. Results A single rare missense variant (c.1522G>A [p.E508K]) was associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 5.48""; 95% CI, 2.83-10.61; P?=?4.4?Â ¡Ã ?10?7) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-Â¦Ã (HNF1A), the gene responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), this variant was found in 0.36% of participants without type 2 diabetes and 2.1% of Participants. In multiethnic replication datasets, the p.E508K variant was seen only in Latino patients (n?=?1443 with type 2 diabetes and 1673 without diabetes) and was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.16 95% CI, 1.75-9.92;""P) ?=?.0013). In experimental experiments, the HNF-1A protein encoding the p.E508K mutant showed reduced transactivation activity of its target promoter compared to a wild-type protein. In our data, carriers and non-carriers of the p.E508K mutation with type 2 diabetes did not show significant differences in the clinical features compared, including age of onset. The mean (SD) age for carriers was 45.3 (11.2) and 47.5 (11.5) for non-carriers (P?=?.49), and the mean (SD) BMI for carriers was 28.2 (5.5) and 29.3 (5.3). non-carriers (P?=?.19). Results and Relevance Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the MODY3-causing gene, HNF1A, that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may affect protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but additional studies are needed.",0,0,
217,Association of Combatant Status and Sexual Violence with Health and Mental Health Outcomes in Post-Conflict Liberia,"Context Liberia's wars since 1989 have claimed tens of thousands of lives and traumatized many people mentally and physically. Objectives To assess the prevalence and impact of war-related psychosocial trauma, including information on participation in the Liberian civil wars, exposure to sexual violence, social functioning, and mental health. Design, Environment, and Participants A cross-sectional, population-based, multistage randomized cluster study of 1666 adults aged 18 and over using structured interviews and questionnaires over a 3-week period in Liberia in May 2008. Key Outcome Measures Signs of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social functioning, exposure to sexual violence, and health and mental health needs among Liberian adults who have witnessed or participated in conflicts over the past 20 years. Results In the Liberian adult householdÂ¨C-based population, 40% (95% CI [CI], 36%-45%""; n = 672/1659) met symptom criteria for MDD, 44% (95% CI, 38%) - 49%; n = 718/1661) met symptom criteria for PTSD, and 8% (95% CI, 5-10%; n = 133/1666) met criteria for social dysfunction. Thirty-three percent (549/1666) of respondents ) reported serving in the fighting forces, and 33.2% of ex-combatants (182/549) were women. Former combatants experienced higher rates of sexual violence than non-combatants: among women, 42.3% (95% CI, 35.4%) vs. 49.1) vs 9.2% (95% CI, 6.7-11.7%); among men, 32.6% (95% CI, 27.6%-37.6%) vs. 7.4% (95% CI, 4.5-10.4%) ) PTSD, MDD, and Rates of suicidal ideation symptoms were higher among ex-combatants than non-combatants and survivors of sexual violence than non-experts. Prevalence of PTSD symptoms among former female combatants who have experienced sexual violence (74%; 95% CI, 63%-84%), not exposed to sexual violence (44%; 95% CI, 33%-53%). The prevalence of PTSD symptoms among male ex-combatants who experienced sexual violence was higher (81%; 95% CI, 74-87%) than male ex-combatants who were not victims of sexual violence (46%; 95% CI, 39). Former male combatants who have experienced sexual violence also reported higher rates of depression symptoms and suicidal ideation. Both former combatants and non-combatants experienced inadequate access to healthcare (33.0% [95% CI, 22.6%-43.4%] and 30.1% [95% CI, 18.7% vs. 41.6%, respectively.)

218,The Relationship of Socioeconomic Position with Health Behaviors and Mortality,"Context Previous studies may have underestimated the contribution of health behaviors to social inequalities in mortality because health behaviors were evaluated only at the start of the study. Purpose To examine the role of health behaviors in the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality and to compare whether their contribution, when assessed at only 1 point in time, differs from that assessed longitudinally over the follow-up period. Design, Environment and Participants The British Whitehall II longitudinal cohort study, established in 1985, included 10308 civil servants aged 35 to 55 living in London, England. Analyzes are based on 9590 men and women followed for mortality through April 30, 2009. Socioeconomic position was originally derived from civil service employment grade (high, medium and low). Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical activity were evaluated 4 times during the follow-up period. Key Outcome Measures All-cause and cause-specific death rate. Results A total of 654 participants died during the follow-up period. In analyzes adjusted for sex and year of birth, those with the lowest socioeconomic status were found to be 1.60 times more likely to die from all causes (a ratio difference of 1.94/1000 person-years) than those with the highest socioeconomic status. This association was weakened by 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-94%) when the health behaviors evaluated at baseline were included in the model, and 72% (95% CI, 42-154%) when entered into the model. entered as time-dependent variables. The corresponding attenuations were 29% (95% CI, 11-54%) and 45% (95% CI, 24-79%) and 61% (95% CI, 16-425%) and 94% for cardiovascular mortality. % (95% CI, 35%–595%) for non-cancer and non-cardiovascular mortality. The difference between only baseline and repeated assessments of health behaviors is mostly due to the increased explanatory power of diet (7% to 17% for all-cause deaths, respectively), physical activity (5% to 21% for all deaths). causes death) and alcohol consumption (3% to 12% for all-cause mortality). The role of smoking, the strongest mediator, in these analyzes did not change when baseline or repeat assessments were used (from 32% to 35% for all-cause mortality). Conclusion In a public service population in London, England, there was an association between socioeconomic status and mortality, which was largely explained by adjustments for health behaviors, particularly when behaviors were repeatedly evaluated.",0,0,
219,Asthma education program in Russia: educating patients,"To address the recent increase in asthma morbidity and mortality in Russia, an intervention study was conducted to improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of asthma. US recommendations on asthma management have been adapted for use in the education of families with children with asthma in Moscow. Two hundred and fifty-two children with asthma aged 4-14 years receiving health care with their parents in eight public health clinics in Moscow were recruited to see if teaching guidelines for the management of asthma in the USA would be acceptable and effective in Russia. Children with a recent asthma attack in four of the clinics were randomly assigned to the education or control group to test whether patient education and guided asthma care would improve outcomes for patients. Both groups were offered modern drugs to see if education was required in US guidelines for getting doctors to use the drugs. Children with recent asthma attacks at the other four clinics were defined as comparison group 1 to control for the possible impact of drug availability. All children without an asthma attack at eight clinics formed comparison group 2 to see if outcomes for these children would change over time. One-year follow-up results showed significant improvement in children's and parents' asthma self-management skills in terms of asthma management among those in the education-only group. Significant increases were observed in the subgroup of children in the education group using anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma control. Children in the training group had significantly increased peak flow rates and reduced daily peak flow variability, compared with the control and comparison groups. Compared to the control group, the children had a significantly greater reduction in doctor visits by the education group. Changes in parents' and children's behavior in terms of asthma management and prevention skills, proper treatment of the disease, and access to medications are likely responsible for reducing asthma morbidity in children.",0,0,
220,Attitudes towards reproduction in Latin America. Teachings from the use of modern reproductive technologies,"The use of modern reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization and related procedures, has opened up new areas of legal, religious and public interest. Thirty years ago, the development of effective methods to control reproduction sparked a debate over whether couples had the right to enjoy sex in the absence of reproductive influence. Today, assisted reproductive technology (ART) allows couples to have children of their own without direct sex. The Catholic Church reacted to both birth control and ART, and specific instructions were given to the public, the medical profession, and legislators. In a recent survey, 88.4% of the population in Latin America claims to be Catholic"";"" therefore, bioethical considerations and legal implications for intervention in reproduction are strongly permeated by the moral teachings of Catholicism. In 1996, 83 medical doctors and scientists who joined the Latin American Network of Assisted Reproduction prepared a consensus document on the ethical aspects and legal implications of ART. The document contains the minimum ethical guidelines that Latin American professionals have decided to abide by even in the absence of regulations. This article examines how the medical profession, legislators, and the public respond to religious influence when faced with difficult bioethical decisions such as reproductive right.",0,0,
221,Supervision and feedback as clinical practice guideline implementation strategy: a model for acute care nurse practitioners.,"BACKGROUND: Putting research evidence into practice and changing provider behavior is challenging, even if the benefits are strong. Despite the availability of supportive care clinical practice guidelines (CPG), consistent integration of these principles into practice has not been achieved. Failure of dissemination strategies has been identified as a major barrier to successful implementation. A potentially effective approach to facilitating the transfer of research evidence to practice is auditing and feedback. Audit and feedback is a summary of provider performance over a period of time, with or without suggestions to improve the application. Rationale: Cancer pain is the most appropriate symptom to study when examining the impact of a control and feedback intervention. It is a common condition with significant consequences, established CPG is available, measurable results have been described and there is potential for improvement in current practice. Acute care nurses (NPs) are often responsible for supervising and directly managing symptoms such as pain and are in a good position to practice CPG and examine the effects of adherence to guidelines on patients' pain outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of published articles, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Library computerized databases, was conducted to assess the state of science on auditing and feedback as a professional practice change strategy. A behavior change model has been proposed for application to advanced nursing practice. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Regarded as a valuable intervention to improve healthcare quality in medicine, supervision and feedback is a strategy that has not been widely studied in nursing. Although cancer pain cannot always be completely eliminated, appropriate use of available treatments can effectively reduce pain in the majority of patients. This article is a review of the literature on supervision and feedback as a professional practice change strategy and shows a model for operationalizing the intervention.",0,1,
222,Supervision and feedback: implications for professional practice and health care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Supervision and feedback continue to be widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice. Given feedback that their clinical practice is inconsistent with that of their peers or accepted guidelines, it seems reasonable to ask healthcare professionals to change their practice. However, supervision and feedback have not been found to be consistently effective. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of supervision and feedback on healthcare professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Care Group Cochrane Register of Effective Practice and Organization and its pending file until January 2004. SELECTION CRITERIA: Objectively reported randomized audit and feedback trials (defined as any summary of clinical performance over a period of time) Professional practice as measured in a healthcare setting or health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated study quality. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual and qualitative analyzes were performed. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and hazard ratio (RR) for each comparison, adjusted for baseline fit where possible, adjusted for dual outcomes, and percentage and percentage change from control group mean after intervention adjusted for baseline performance. for possible, lasting results. We explored the following factors as possible explanations for variation in the effectiveness of interventions between comparisons: type of intervention (supervision and feedback only, supervision and feedback with training sessions, or multiple interventions involving supervision and feedback), intensity of the intervention. supervision and feedback, the complexity of the intended behavior, the severity of the result, the basic compliance and quality of work. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty new studies have been added to this update, with a total of 118 studies included. The primary analysis included 88 comparisons from 72 studies that compared any intervention in which supervision and feedback were a component with those without interventions. For dual outcomes, adjusted risk difference of adherence to desired application - 0.16 (16% absolute decrease in compliance) to 0.70 (70% increase in compliance) (median = 0.05, interquartile range = 0.03 to 0.11) and the adjusted hazard ratio ranged from 0.71 to 18.3 (median = 1.08, interquartile range = 0.99 to 1.30). For sustained results, the adjusted percent change from control ranged from -0.10 (10% absolute decrease in agreement) to 0.68 (68% increase in agreement) (median = 0.16, interquartile range = 0.05 to 0.37) has changed. Low baseline adherence to recommended practice and higher intensity of supervision and feedback were associated with greater adjusted risk ratios (higher efficacy) across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Supervision and feedback can be effective in improving professional practice. When effective, the effects are usually minor to moderate. The relative effectiveness of supervision and feedback is likely to be greater when baseline adherence to proposed practice is low and feedback is given more intensively.",0,1,
223,Supervision of a tuberculosis contact tracing clinic,"OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis contact tracing in South Glamorgan 1987-9. DESIGN Review of contact tracing clinic records and data from the Mycobacterium Reference Unit. The practice of the clinic was compared with the 1983 British Thoracic Society recommendations. ADJUST Health authority tuberculosis control program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Ratio of contacts screened, follow-up participation rates, number of secondary cases detected and quality of record keeping. RESULTS 101 index patients and 611 contacts were identified. 596 (97.5%) contacts were screened, of which 139 should not have been screened. Of the 356 contacts who required the Heaf test, 237 were tested, seven refused the test, and 112 had chest radiographs without the Heaf test. 95 people were unnecessarily tested. Unnecessary chest X-rays were performed on 87 contacts, and seven of them should have had radiographs, but they were not done. 34 people were inappropriately given follow-up appointments and seven were ignored for follow-up. Five asymptomatic contacts were diagnosed with tuberculosis, all at initial screening and in all close contacts of index patients with pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION Insufficient data, non-compliance with contact tracing guidelines, and failure to define the term highly contagious index case resulted in unnecessary screening or monitoring of many contacts. PRACTICES The efficiency of tracking contacts can be improved by specifying the ethnic origin and spillover results of the index case in the reporting form, clearly classifying contacts as proximal or causal, and clearly defining the term highly contagious.",0,0,
224,Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression,"BACKGROUND: The Royal College of Psychiatrists of Australia and New Zealand (RANZCP) coordinates the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry funded by the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Department of Health. METHODS: The CPG team reviewed the treatment outcome literature, consulted practitioners and patients, and conducted meta-analyses of the outcome research. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish an effective therapeutic relationship""; inform patient of condition, rationale for treatment, probability of positive response and expected time; consider patient strengths, life stressors, and supports. The choice of treatment depends on the patient's condition. clinician's skills and patient's circumstances and In moderately severe depression, all recognized antidepressants, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are equally effective, with clinicians weighing the burdens of treatment as well as benefits, including side effects and toxicity. In severe depression, antidepressant treatment should precede psychological treatment. For psychotic depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or tricyclic with an antipsychotic is equally helpful. Treatments for other subtypes are discussed. For people taking other medications or have medical conditions. e should be careful. If response to an adequate first-line therapy trial is inadequate, another evidence-based therapy should be used. Second opinions are helpful.

225,Author disclosure of conflict of interest in vascular surgery journals,"OBJECTIVES: Advances in vascular surgery are increasingly based on technology, and the relationships between surgeons and the medical device industry can be complex. This study is intended to suggest further directions by reviewing conflict of interest (COI) disclosure on several selected technology-driven topics, including endovascular stent grafts (EV), carotid artery stenting (CAS), and peripheral artery interventions (PI) in vascular surgery journals. METHODS: The authors' COI statements were reviewed from all clinical articles on three selected topics (EV, CAS, and PI) published in 2008 and 2009 in each of the six vascular surgery journals. COI disclosure rate was evaluated as a function of journal, subject, type of article (random search, case series, case report, review, or meta-analysis), and authors' region of origin. Second, the consistency of the authors' statements was evaluated by examining articles by the same author and on the same subject. RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-five articles from six journals were reviewed. A COI was reported in 125 (19.7%) of these articles. This ratio differed between journals (range, 3.2%-34.1%""; P < .0001). Disclosure rate did not differ between subjects (range, 12.8%-21.2%; P = .12), type of article (range, .0001). 14.7%-30%; P = .28) or region of origin (range, 0-33.3%; ""P = .09). There were 116 instances where the same author wrote articles describing the same general topic. The COI expression was consistent in most of these samples (72.4%), but inconsistent in 32 cases (27.6%). The most common (P = .006) discrepancies included the same type of article in different journals (46.9%) or in the same journal (25%). CONCLUSIONS: In the vascular surgery literature, discrepancies in CO disclosure and disclosure are at least partially due to differences in journal reporting policies, while a smaller proportion of these inconsistencies are due to individual author behavior. Journals should adopt a consistent requirement for a separate COI statement describing all relevant financial arrangements.",0,0,

227,Automatic hand hygiene monitoring with and without intervention,"BACKGROUND: Daily feedback from continuous automated monitoring with peer reminder intervention was used to improve compliance. Compliance rates from invasive and non-intrusive covert and overt automated inspection stages were compared with mandatory human inspections. METHODS: An automated system was installed to covertly detect hand hygiene incidents each time the alcohol-based handrub dispenser was pressed for 5 months. The open phase involved key clinicians trained to share daily rates with clinicians, set compliance goals, and nudge each other to adhere for 6 months. For the next 6 months, the intervention continued without renewal. Australian Hand Hygiene (HHA) human inspections were conducted quarterly at the time of response in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Percentage point (PP) differences between the compliance rates were used to determine the change. RESULTS: HCA rates for June 2014 were 85% and 87% in medical and surgical wards, respectively. These rates were 55 PPs and 38 PPs, 30% and 49% higher, respectively, than the covert automation rates in the medical and surgical service in June 2014. In the intervention phase, mean compliance in the medical ward did not change from the covert rate, while the surgical service increased to 60% with 11 PPs compared to the covert phase. On average, compliance without renewal during intervention did not change in the medical ward, while the average rate decreased by 9 PPs in the surgical ward. RESULTS: Automation has provided a unique opportunity to respond to day-to-day rates, but compliance will return to pre-intervention levels once active intervention ends or human supervisors leave service unless clinicians are committed to change.",1,1,
228,Automatic Identification of Postoperative Complications in the Electronic Medical Record Using Natural Language Processing,"Context Currently most automated methods for identifying patient safety incidents are based on administrative data codes"";"" however, free text searches of electronic medical records may represent an additional surveillance approach. Purpose To evaluate a natural language processing search approach to identify postoperative surgical complications in a comprehensive electronic medical record. Design, Environment, and Patients Cross-sectional study of 2974 patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures at 6 Gazi Health Administration (VHA) medical centers from 1999 to 2006. Main Outcome Measures Postoperative occurrences of acute renal failure requiring dialysis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism Sepsis, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction identified by medical record review as part of the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program. To identify these complications, we determined the sensitivity and specificity of the natural language processing approach and compared its performance with patient safety indicators using discharge coding information. Results The rate of postoperative events for each sample was 2% (39 of 1924) for acute renal failure requiring dialysis, 0.7% (2327 of 18) for pulmonary embolism, 1% (29 of 2327), 7% for deep vein thrombosis. ( 61/866) for sepsis, 16% (222/1405) pneumonia and 2% (1822/35) myocardial infarction. Natural language processing correctly identified 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67-91%) of acute renal failure cases and 38% (95% CI, 25%-54%) for patient safety indicators . Venous thromboembolism (59%, 95% CI, 44-72% vs 46%, 95% CI, 32-60%), pneumonia (64%, 95% CI, 58-70% vs 5%, 95% CI, %) 3-9) sepsis (89%, 95% CI, 78-94% - 34%, 95% CI, 24-47%) and postoperative myocardial infarction (91%), 95% CI, 78-97%) vs % 89, 95% CI, 74-96%). Both natural language processing and patient safety indicators were highly specific for these diagnoses. Conclusion Among patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures at VA medical centers, natural language processing analysis of electronic medical records to identify postoperative complications had higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared to patient safety indicators based on discharge coding.",0,0,
229,Availability and prescription practice of anti-malarial drugs in the private healthcare sector in Yemen,"INTRODUCTION: Although the Yemeni government changed its national policy to treat malaria in November 2005 from chloroquine to combination drugs in the form of artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line and lumefantrine + artemether as second-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria, clinicians in public and private healthcare settings continued to prescribe chloroquine because their knowledge of the new treatment policy was insufficient. METHODOLOGY: A nonrandomized trial of pre- and post-evaluation of education and reporting interventions on prescription behavior and availability of antimalarial drugs among private sector clinicians and pharmacists in three provinces in Yemen was conducted. RESULTS: Private sector clinicians adherence to new national guidelines for antimalarial drugs increased from 21% in the pre-intervention period to 38% after the artesunate + SP intervention was prescribed as first-line therapy. The prescription of lumefantrine + artemether as second-line anti-malarial therapy was also increased from 18% before the intervention to 22% after the intervention. Unfortunately, the halofantrine + SP combination continued to be frequently prescribed by clinicians in Sana'a (18%). Artesunate + SP and quinine significantly increase their marketing from 8% pre-intervention to 22% post-intervention (P-value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence of the usefulness of the educational intervention on national guidelines for malaria treatment. In addition, the inclusion of private healthcare providers in reporting procedures will support the rational prescribing and availability of antimalarial drugs.",0,0,
230,Current screening tools for adults suffering from bipolar affective disorder in primary care: An integrative literature review,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of six tools used in primary care for screening for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). BPAH has historically been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, followed by inappropriate treatment, resulting in harmful relapses, suicide, and increased risks of comorbidity. DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was conducted to identify articles in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, National Guideline Clearinghouse, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences collection, and PsycARTICLES databases. Other information was also gathered from the NIH, CDC, Healthy People 2020, Black Dog Institute, and the Center for Quality Assessment and Development for Mental Health. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that primary care providers are often the first and sometimes the only providers, pointing to the importance of early detection and screening for BPAH in primary care. With the use of appropriate screening tools and the implementation of recommended treatment and intervention guidelines, relapse prevention is increased and comorbidities are diagnosed more frequently, leading to an overall improved quality of life. APPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Primary care practitioners play a vital role in screening appropriately for BPAH and implementing recommended treatments to increase relapse prevention and promote a healthier and more socially successful quality of life.",0,0,
231,Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of multiple stroke guideline recommendations: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Turning evidence into practice is an important final step in the evidence-based practice process. Medical record audits can be used to examine how well practice compares to published evidence and to identify evidence-practice gaps. After providing supervisory feedback to professionals, local barriers to practice change can be identified and targeted with focused behavior change interventions. This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators in the implementation of multiple stroke guideline recommendations in an Australian stroke unit. METHODS: A qualitative methodology was used. A sample of 28 allied health, nursing and medical professionals participated in a group or individual interview. These interviews took place after staff received audit feedback and identified areas for practice change. Upper extremity sensory impairments, mobility including sitting balance""; vision; anxiety and depression; neglect; swallowing; communication; education for stroke survivors and caregivers; advice on return to work and qualitative data themes using theoretical areas described by Michie et al. (2005) RESULTS: Six group and two individual interviews involving six disciplines were conducted. The barriers differed between disciplines. The six main barriers identified were: (1) Beliefs about individual professionals' abilities and disciplines and patient abilities (2) Positive and negative implementation of recommendations Beliefs about outcomes (3) Memory and attention to best practices (4) Required knowledge and skills to apply best practice; (5) Intention and motivation to implement best practice; and (6) Resources. Some obstacles also brought about change. For example, occupational therapists needed new knowledge and skills (a disability) to better manage sensory and neglect disorders, while physical therapists often knew how to best implement mobility rehabilitation (an enabler). CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to the existing knowledge to modify and implement the multiple guideline recommendations. Major challenges included sex education and screening for depression. Limited knowledge and skills were a common barrier. Knowledge of specific interventions was required prior to administration and to maintain treatment accuracy. Providing detailed online intervention protocols and guidelines can help clinicians overcome the knowledge barrier.",0,0,
232,Barriers and Facilitators Associated with the Use of Nonsurgical Treatment in Osteoarthritis Patients in Orthopedic Practice,"INTRODUCTION: International evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) recommend starting with nonsurgical treatments (a combination) and using surgical intervention only if a patient does not respond adequately to nonsurgical treatment. treatment options. Despite these recommendations, there are strong indications that nonsurgical treatments are not optimally used in orthopedic practice. To improve the adoption of nonsurgical treatments, more information is needed on the barriers and facilitators of these treatments. Therefore, this study evaluated what barriers and facilitators are associated with the use and prescribing of different non-surgical treatments before hip and knee OA in orthopedic practice among Dutch patients and orthopedic surgeons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted two internet-based surveys among 172 orthopedic surgeons and 174 OA patients. Univariate association and multivariate regression techniques are used to identify barriers and facilitators associated with the use of nonsurgical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Most barriers and facilitators among patients were associated with use of physical therapy, lifestyle advice, and dietary therapy. Among orthopedic surgeons, most have been associated with acetaminophen prescription, diet therapy, and physical therapy. Examples of barriers and facilitators among patients include ""People around me had positive experiences with a surgery"" (facilitator for education about OA) and ""Advice for people around me to keep moving"" (facilitator for lifestyle and dietary advice). Examples for orthopedic surgeons were ""Lack of knowledge about the guideline"" (barrier for lifestyle advice), ""Agreements/negotiations with primary care"" and ""Easy communication with dietitian"" (facilitators for diet therapy). Also, belief in the effectiveness of these treatments was associated with increased prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to improve the use of nonsurgical therapy in orthopedic practice should aim to change the beliefs of orthopedic surgeons, communicate with other OA care providers, and involve the patient's environment in OA treatment.",0,0,
233,Barriers and facilitators to the implementation of VA home primary care in American Indian reservations: a qualitative multiple case study.,"Background Veterans Health Affairs (VA) home primary care (HBPC) is an evidence-based interdisciplinary approach to non-institutional long-term care developed in urban settings to provide longitudinal care for vulnerable elderly patients. Under the mandate of a Memorandum of Understanding between the VA and the Indian Health Service (IHS) to improve access to healthcare, 14 VA medical centers (VAMCs) independently initiated plans to expand their HBPC programs to rural Native American reservations, and 12 VAMCs successfully implemented programs. The purpose of this study is to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation in rural Indigenous communities in order to inform planners and policy makers for future program expansions. Methods A qualitative comparative case study approach was used, taking each of the 14 VAMCs as a case. Telephone interviews (n = 37) were conducted with HBPC staff and clinicians participating or supervising practice, and local/regional managers, using the Consolidated Framework for Practice Research (CFIR) to inform an open-ended interview guide. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and then analyzed using CFIR domains and structures to describe and compare experiences and identify facilitators, barriers, and adaptations that co-occurred in the VAMC and HBPC programs. The results differed significantly in local contexts across the VAMC. However, the practice was typically facilitated by key individuals who were able to build trust and belief in VA healthcare among American Indian communities. The policy promoted clinical collaboration, but collaborations were often ad hoc between VA and IHS clinicians to optimize patient resources. All programs required some adaptation to address barriers such as distances in rural areas, caseloads or delays in hiring additional clinicians. VA funding opportunities have facilitated the expansion and maintenance of these programs. Conclusions Since program expansion is the responsibility of the HBPC program director, there is little sharing of lessons learned at VA facilities. Shared learning opportunities will benefit federal health agencies to expand other medical services to additional American Indian communities and other rural and underserved communities, as well as to coordinate with other healthcare organizations. The CFIR framework was an effective analytical tool for comparing programs for multiple internal and external settings.",0,0,
234,Barriers and facilitators to evidence-based practice in perinatal care in the SEA-ORCHID project,"RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: Optimizing Reproductive and Child Health in Developing Countries The Southeast Asia (SEA-ORCHID) project aimed to improve maternal and infant health outcomes at nine hospitals in Southeast Asia by supporting evidence-based perinatal health services. . In this study, we aimed to identify and explore factors that may have acted as barriers or enablers to evidence-based practice change in each of the hospitals. METHODS: Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 179 nurses, midwives, and doctors from the maternal and neonatal departments in each of the nine participating Southeast Asia during the last 6 months of the intervention phase of the project. hospitals. RESULTS: The interviews identified several factors that participants believed had a significant impact on the effectiveness of the SEA-ORCHID intervention. These; knowledge, skills, hierarchy, multidisciplinary and beliefs about leadership, outcomes, resources, and the nature of behavior. The success of the SEA-ORCHID intervention in improving implementation may reflect the extent to which tailor-made strategies have been effective in overcoming these barriers. CONCLUSION: Effective interventions to align practice with the evidence rely on identifying and addressing barriers to practice change. The barriers identified in this study may be beneficial for those designing similar clinical practice improvement projects, as well as for continued efforts to improve practice at SEA-ORCHID hospitals.",0,0,
235,Barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening in underserved women of the District of Columbia,"OBJECTIVES: Identifying barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening services from the perspective of medically underserved women in the District of Columbia (DC) and may influence their intentions to perform breast and cervical cancer screening behaviors""; between attitudes and cervical cancer screening behaviors identify any relationship. the influence of significant others on the intended behavior;"" and to determine the relationship between the site where services are offered and the intentions of underserved women to participate in browsing behavior. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, relational. SETTING: Breast and cervical cancer screening clinics in DC. EXAMPLE: 339 medically underserved adult women. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews conducted by the researcher. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Attitudes and influence of key people as well as demographic and contextual variables. Intention to have a mammogram or Pap test, or an intention to have a monthly breast self-exam (BSE). RESULTS: Intention to have a mammogram was positively associated with the influence of important people and negatively with the caregiver health professionals. Intention to have a Pap test was positively correlated with one's attitude towards the test and the influence of significant others. Intention to perform BSE was positively associated with attitude and prior performance towards BSE, and the influence of significant others. No significant relationship was observed between the intention to perform screening behaviors and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Factors affecting women's attitudes towards screening and their intention to perform these behaviors include previous screening behaviors, the influence of significant other people, and relationships with health professionals. APPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are well placed to develop and test intervention strategies designed to increase access to and compliance with recommended screening guidelines among medically underserved. Findings from this study could potentially guide the development and evaluation of such strategies sensitive to this particular population.",0,0,
236,Barriers to the implementation of preconception care guidelines as perceived by general practitioners: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence for the benefits of preconception interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes, the giving and taking of preconception care and periconceptional folate supplementation remains low. General practitioners play a central role in providing preconception care. Understanding general practitioners' perceptions of barriers and facilitators in the delivery of prenatal care allows for more appropriate targeting of quality improvement interventions. In conclusion, the aim of this study was to examine the barriers and facilitators to the delivery and receipt of pre-pregnancy care guidelines from the perspective of general practitioners, using theoretical fields related to behavior change. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups of 22 GPs recruited from three regional general practice support organisations. The questions were based on the theoretical domain framework that identified 12 domains related to behavior change. General practitioners' responses were classified into predefined themes using a deductive thematic analysis process. CONCLUSIONS: Capabilities, motivations and goals, environmental context and resources, and beliefs about memory, attention, and decision making are key areas identified in the barrier analysis. Some of the perceived barriers identified by GPs are time constraints, lack of women presenting in the prepregnancy stage, multiple competing preventive priorities in the general practice setting, problems with and cost of accessing preconception care, and problems with accessing preconception care. Resources to help provide pre-pregnancy care guidelines. Perceived facilitators identified by general practitioners included the availability of preconception care checklists and patient brochures, handbooks, and waiting room posters outlining the benefits and usability of preconception care consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified some of the barriers and facilitators to the delivery and receipt of preconception care guidelines as perceived by general practitioners. Relating these barriers to a theoretical field framework provides a clearer understanding of some of the psychological aspects involved in the behavior of general practitioners towards the provision and receipt of prenatal care. Further research prioritizing these barriers and the theoretical areas with which they relate is necessary before a methodologically rigorous intervention can be designed, implemented and evaluated.",0,0,
237,Barriers to Use of Breast Cancer Risk Reduction Treatments,"Evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the use of tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Revised clinical guidelines now strongly recommend that doctors recommend drugs to high-risk women to reduce their risk of breast cancer. Although only a small proportion of eligible women take risk-reducing medication, evidence suggests greater acceptance among women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Among physicians, barriers to prescribing risk reduction drugs include inadequate training in risk assessment, lack of reimbursement for prevention counseling, and a lack of easily accessible and user-friendly estimation tools for estimating risk/benefit profiles. Strategies to increase intake among women have focused on providing education about breast cancer risk and information that accurately conveys the risks and benefits of risk reduction drugs. Priority areas of research identified to improve the use of risk-reducing drugs are (1) the development of risk assessment tools that more accurately identify the women most likely to benefit, and (2) the identification of circulating or tissue biomarkers that can predict and monitor. and (3) a better understanding of patient-related barriers, including patients' subjective beliefs and experiences.",0,0,
238,Baseline Depression Severity as a Moderator of Depression Outcomes Between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Pharmacotherapy: A Meta-analysis of Individual Patient Data,"IMPORTANCE: Current guidelines recommend treating severe depression with pharmacotherapy. Traditional meta-analyses as well as randomized clinical trials have important limitations in testing moderators of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic literature search, collect primary data from studies, and analyze baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication (ADM). DATA SOURCES: A total of 14902 abstracts were reviewed from an extensive literature review in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials from 1966 to January 1, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials comparing CBT and ADM included patients with DSM-defined depressive disorder. DATA ATTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study authors were asked to provide primary data from their research. Primary data from 16 (67%) of 24 studies identified with 1700 outpatients (794 from CBT status and 906 from ADM status) were included. Missing data loaded with multiple assignment methods. Mixed-effect models, adjusting for differences in study level, were used to examine baseline depression severity as moderators of treatment outcomes. KEY OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Seventeen-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: ADM had a main effect on CBT on HAM-D (beta = -0.88""; P = .03) and a negligible trend on BDI (beta = -1.14; P = .08, statistical test for trend) , but no significant difference in response (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; P = .12) or remission (OR, 1.18; P = .22), but not a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms between CBT and ADM (beta = 0.00; P = .96) Similar results were seen using the BDI, with baseline depression severity also not reducing the probability of response (OR, 0.99; P = .77) or remission (OR, 1.00; ""P = .93) between CBT and ADM. RESULTS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline depression severity did not attenuate differences between CBT and ADM on HAM-D or BDI, or in response or remission. This finding cannot be predicted to other psychotherapies, individual ADMs, or inpatients. However, researchers provide new and important evidence that is important to doctors, therapists, and patients.",0,0,
239,Key feature of a randomized trial evaluating the effects of disease management programs for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive, long-term patient education programs designed to improve self-management can help patients better manage their medical condition. Using disease management programs (DMPs) established for each of the risk factors according to clinical practice guidelines, we evaluate their impact on stroke recurrence prevention. METHODS: This is a randomized trial conducted within 1 year from initiation in patients with ischemic stroke. Subjects in the intervention group received a 6-month DMP that included self-management training provided by a nurse and collaborative support with a primary care physician. Those in the usual care group received ordinary outpatient care. The primary endpoints were stroke recurrence and stroke death. The patients were enrolled for 2 years with 2-year follow-up plans after the 6-month training period (30 months in total). RESULTS: A total of 321 eligible subjects (mean age, 67.3 years"";"" female, 96 [29.9%]) were included in this study, including 21 (6.5%) subjects with transient ischemic attack. Regarding risk factors for stroke, 260 patients (81.0%) had hypertension, 249 (77.6%) dyslipidemia, 102 (31.8%) diabetes mellitus, 47 (14.6%) atrial fibrillation, and 98 (30.5%) patients. ) had chronic kidney disease. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of subject characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the rationale, design, and key features of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of DMPs for secondary prevention of stroke.

241,Behavior change without behavior change communication: Provoking handwashing among primary school students in Bangladesh.,"Behavior change communication to improve soap handwashing can be labor- and resource-intensive, but quality results are difficult to achieve. Nudges are environmental cues involved in unconscious decision-making processes to accelerate behavior change. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed an inexpensive poke kit to promote handwashing with soap after toilet use in two primary schools in rural Bangladesh. We completed direct observation of behaviors at baseline, after providing the traditional handwashing background, and over multiple time periods (1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks) following targeted handwashing impulses. Additional handwashing tutorial or motivational message incomplete. Among schoolchildren, handwashing with soap was low at baseline (4%), increasing to 68% the day after the nudge was completed, and to 74% at both 2 weeks and 6 weeks post-intervention. The results suggest that nudge-based interventions have the potential to improve handwashing with soap among school-aged children in Bangladesh, and specific areas of further research are discussed.",0,1,
242,Behavioral Counseling After Primary Care Alcohol Abuse Screening: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"Background: Alcohol abuse, which spans the full spectrum from risky alcohol use to alcohol dependence, is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Objective: To evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescents and adults who abuse alcohol. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and reference lists of published literature (January 1985 - January 2012, limited to English-language articles). Study Selection: Controlled trials of at least 6 months with screening in primary care settings enrolled individuals with alcohol abuse identified and evaluated behavioral counseling interventions. Data Extraction: One reviewer extracted data and a second check accuracy. Two independent reviewers gave quality ratings and rated the strength of the evidence. Data Synthesis: The 23 included studies generally excluded people with alcohol dependence. The best evidence was short (10 to 15 minute) multi-contact interventions. Among adults receiving behavioral interventions, consumption decreased from baseline by 3.6 drinks/week (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/week [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8 drinks/week]""; 10 trials; 4332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported episodes of heavy drinking (risk difference, 0.12 [CI, 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 trials; 2737 participants), and 11% more adults reported drinking less alcohol than the recommended limits (risk difference, 0.11 [CI, 0.08] to 0.13]; 9 trials ;"" 5973 participants) compared with control participants over 12 months (moderate strength of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about accidents, injuries, or alcohol-related liver problems. Trials that enrolled young adults or college students showed less consumption and fewer heavy drinking episodes (moderate strength of evidence). Little or no evidence of harm was found. Limitations: Because control participants' behavior may have been influenced by assessments of alcohol abuse, results may be biased to zero. Also, the evidence probably does not apply to people with alcohol dependence and selective reporting may have occurred. Conclusion: Behavioral counseling interventions improve behavioral outcomes for adults who are risky drinkers. Primary Funding: Agency for Health Research and Quality.",0,0,

Objective: Counseling to help the US Preventive Services Task Force update previous recommendations by systematically reviewing physical activity or dietary trials. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2001 - January 2010), experts and available systematic reviews. Study Selection: Two researchers independently reviewed 13 562 abstracts and 481 articles against a series of series. critically evaluated each study using a priori inclusion criteria and design-specific quality criteria. Data Extraction and Analysis: Data from 73 studies (109 articles) were summarized by one referee and checked by a second referee. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for multiple intermediate health and behavioral outcomes. Data Synthesis: Long-term observational follow-up of intensive sodium reduction counseling showed a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular disease"";"" however, other direct evidence for reduction in disease morbidity is lacking. High-intensity dietary counseling resulted in changes in body mass index (adiposity) of ?0.3 to ?0.7 kg/m2 at ?1.5 mm Hg (95% CI, ?0.9 to ?2.1 mm Hg), with or without physical activity counselling. . systolic blood pressure, ?0.7 mm Hg (CI, ?0.6 to ?0.9 mm Hg), diastolic pressure ?0.17 mmol/L (CI, ?0.09 to ?0.25 mmol/L) (?6.56 mg/dL [CI, ?3.47] to ?9.65 mg/dL]) and ?0.13 mmol/L (CI, ?0.06 to ?0.21 mmol/L) (?5.02 mg/dL [CI, ?2.32 to ?8.11 mg/dL] ]) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Moderate and high-intensity counseling resulted in moderate to large changes in the person's reported dietary and physical activity behaviors. Limitations: There was evidence for large statistical heterogeneity or publication bias in meta-analyses of some results. Only 11 trials followed the results after 12 months. Conclusion: Counseling to improve diet or increase physical activity changed health behaviors and was associated with minor improvements in adiposity, blood pressure and lipid levels.

Objective: To identify factors that regulate the effectiveness of behavioral programs for adults with type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: 6 databases (1993 - January 2015), conference proceedings (2011 - 2014) and reference lists. Study Selection: Repeated screening and selection of 132 randomized, controlled studies that evaluated behavioral programs compared to habitual care, active controls, or other behavioral programs. Data Extraction: Data extracted by one reviewer and validated by another. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias. Data Synthesis: Behavior programs are grouped according to program content and delivery methods. A Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that most lifestyle and diabetes self-management education and support programs (usually offering Â¡à 11 contact hours) lead to clinically significant improvements in glycemic control (Â¡¡% in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]). 0.4 reduction), most diabetes self-management education programs without additional supportÂ¡Âªespecially those that offer 10 or fewer contact hoursÂ¡Âª have found little benefit. Programs with higher effect sizes were delivered in person more often than through technology. Lifestyle programs led to the largest reductions in body mass index. Reductions in HbA1c seemed greater for participants with a baseline HbA1c of 7.0% or higher, adults younger than 65, and minority people (Â¡Ã subgroups with 75% non-white participants). Limitations: All studies had a moderate or high risk of bias. Subgroup analyzes were indirect and therefore exploratory. Most outcomes were reported immediately after interventions. Conclusion: Diabetes self-management training with 10 or fewer hours of contact with the birthing staff yielded little benefit. Behavioral programs seem to benefit people with suboptimal or poor glycemic control more than those with good control. Primary Source of Funding: Agency for Health Research and Quality.

247,Behavioral Sexual Risk Reduction Counseling in Primary Care to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common and preventable. Purpose: To update a previous systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of sexual risk reduction counseling to prevent STIs. Data Sources: Selected databases from January 2007 to October 2013, manual searches of reference lists and gray literature, and studies from previous review. Study Selection: Fair or good quality English language trials conducted in adolescents or adults. Data Extraction: One researcher summarized the data and another controlled the abstraction. Study quality was reviewed in pairs. Data Synthesis: 31 studies were included: 16 (n = 56 110) were newly published and 15 (n = 14 214) were from previous review. Most studies targeted people at increased risk of STIs based on sociodemographic characteristics, risky sexual behavior, or a history of STIs. High-intensity (>2 hours) interventions were used in adolescents (odds ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60]) and adults (odds ratio, 0.70 [CI, 0.56 to 0.87]) ]) reduced the incidence of STIs. Low-intensity interventions were generally not effective in adults, but some approaches were promising. Although moderate-intensity interventions may be effective in adolescents, data were very sparse. Reported behavioral outcomes were heterogeneous and likely to show a benefit with high-intensity interventions in 6 months or less. No consistent evidence was found that sexual risk reduction counseling is harmful. Limitations: Low-risk populations and male adolescents were underrepresented. The reliability of self-reported behavioral outcomes was unknown. Conclusion: High-intensity counseling on sexual risk reduction may reduce STIs in primary care and related settings, especially in sexually active adolescents and adults at high risk of STIs.

248,Behavioral Therapy with or Without Biofeedback and Pelvic Floor Electrical Stimulation for Persistent Postprostatectomy Incontinence,"Context Although behavioral therapy has been shown to improve recovery after continence, no controlled trial of behavioral therapy for post-prostatectomy incontinence lasting longer than 1 year has been conducted. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral therapy to reduce persistent postprostatectomy incontinence and to determine whether biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation technologies increase the effectiveness of behavioral therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at a university and 2 Veterans Affairs continence clinics (2003–2008) involving 208 community-dwelling men aged 51 to 84 years with incontinence 1 to 17 years after radical prostatectomy. 1-year follow-up after active treatment. Twenty-four percent of men were African American”; 75%, white. Interventions After stratification by type and frequency of incontinence, participants were randomized to one of 3 groups: 8 weeks of behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies), behavioral therapy plus in-office , dual-channel electromyograph biofeedback and daily home pelvic floor electrical stimulation at 20 Hz, current up to 100 mA (behavior plus) or delayed treatment used as control group Decreased in mean number of incontinence episodes after 8 weeks of treatment as documented in 7-day bladder diaries Results Mean incontinence episodes decreased from 28 to 13 per week (55% reduction; 95% confidence interval [CI], 44%-66% ) after behavioral therapy and from 26 to 12 (51% reduction) after behavior plus therapy; 95% CI, 37-65%) Both reductions were observed among those controls from 25 to 21 (24% reduction; 95% CI, 10-39%) (P = .001 for both treatment groups). together, treatment There was no significant difference in the reduction of incontinence between the groups (P = .69). Improvements were sustained for up to 12 months in the active treatment groups: 50% reduction in the behavioral group (95% CI, 39.8%-61.1%; 13.5% episodes per week) and 59% reductions (95% CI, 45.0%-73.1%; ""9.1 episodes per week) behavior Results in the plus group (P = .32) Results In patients with incontinence after prostatectomy for at least 1 year, 8 weeks of behavioral therapy resulted in fewer episodes of incontinence compared to delayed treatment control The addition of biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation did not result in greater efficacy.",0,0,
249,Behavioral treatment of obesity in primary care patients: a systematic review.,"IMPORTANCE: In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved intensive behavioral weight loss counseling for obese beneficiaries in primary care settings for approximately 14 face-to-face, 10- to 15-minute sessions over 6 months postpartum. by physicians and other CMS-defined primary care practitioners. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of behavioral counseling for overweight and obese patients recruited from primary care, either by primary care practitioners working alone or with trained responders (eg, medical assistants, registered dietitians) or by trained responders working independently. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We sought randomized controlled trials that recruited overweight and obese patients from primary care, published in PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE between January 1980 and June 2014""; provided behavioral counseling (i.e. diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy) for at least 3 months , with at least 6 months of postrandomization follow-up; at least 15 participants per treatment group, including objectively measured weights; and had a comparator, an intent-to-treat analysis, and less than 30% at 1 year or less than 40% attrition at longer follow-up RESULTS: A review of 3304 abstracts yielded 12 studies including 3893 participants who met inclusion-exclusion criteria and predetermined quality ratings No studies were found in which primary care practitioners counseled following CMS guidelines.Mean 6-month weight changes from baseline in intervention groups 0, It varies between 3 kg and 6.6 kg.In the control group, the mean The ma change ranged from a 0.9 kg gain to a 2.0 kg loss. Weight loss generally decreased with longer follow-up (12-24 months) in both groups. Interventions that predicted both reduced energy intake (eg >/= 500 kcal/day) and increased physical activity (eg >/=150 min walking) with conventional behavioral therapy resulted in greater weight loss overall than non-all interventions. 3 special ingredients. In previous studies, more treatment sessions delivered in person or over the phone by trained responders were associated with a greater average weight loss and a likelihood that patients would lose 5% or more of their baseline weight. RESULTS AND RELIABILITY: Intensive behavioral counseling can result in clinically significant weight loss, but there is little research on primary care practitioners providing this type of care. Current findings suggest that a range of trained responders who provide in-person or telephone counseling may be considered for the treatment of overweight or obesity in patients encountered in primary care settings.",0,0,
250,Behavior modification strategies to reduce blood pressure-related disease burden: findings from a global practice research program,"BACKGROUND: The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases includes the majority of public research funding organizations around the world. It focuses on application research to tackle the burden of chronic diseases in low- and middle-income countries and vulnerable populations in high-income countries. In the initial call for research, 15 projects focused on reducing the burden of disease associated with blood pressure were funded. In this study, we describe a reflexive mapping exercise to identify behavior change strategies undertaken in each of these projects. METHODS: Using the Wheel of Behavior Change framework, each team rated the abilities, opportunities, and motivations of the various actors who are an integral part of each project (for example, community members, non-physician health workers, and doctors in projects focused on service delivery). The teams then mapped the interventions they implemented and identified the key policy categories in which these interventions operated. Provided guidance on using the Behavior Modification Wheel to promote consistency in responses across teams. The ratings were repeatedly discussed and developed in several group meetings. RESULTS: There were marked differences in the perceived abilities, opportunities, and motivations of the various actors targeted for behavior modification strategies. Despite this diversity, there was a high degree of synergy in intervention functions, with most teams using complex interventions that included education, training, enabling, environmental restructuring, and persuasion-driven strategies. Similar policy categories were also targeted across teams, particularly in the areas of guidelines, communications/marketing and service delivery, with few teams focused on financial measures, regulation and legislation. CONCLUSIONS: The great diversity in preparedness for behavior change among the main actors in these projects suggests that, despite the similarity in approaches taken, the interventions themselves will be addressed in a variable way. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in driving the success and failure of research programs. Results and process evaluations from each project will build upon this exploratory work and provide a better understanding of factors that may influence magnification of response strategies.",0,0,

252,Beliefs and attitudes about breast cancer and screening practices among Arab women living in Qatar: A cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Despite rising breast cancer incidence and death rates, breast cancer screening (BCS) rates among women in Qatar remain low. Previous studies point to the need to better understand the many complex beliefs, values and attitudes that influence health-seeking behavior of Arab women in order to develop culturally appropriate and effective intervention strategies to address breast cancer in the Middle East. This study examines the beliefs, attitudes and BCS practices of Arabic-speaking women in Qatar. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional quantitative survey was conducted in Qatar from March 2011 to July 2011 with 1,063 (87.5% response rate) Arabic speaking Qatari and non-Qatari women aged 35 years or older. Beliefs and BCS applications were estimated using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Participants who met the BCS guidelines (BCS application = Yes) were compared with those who did not (BCS application = No). RESULTS: In addition to low awareness levels and low participation rates in BCS, a quarter of respondents said their doctor had talked to them about breast cancer and less than half of the women interviewed believed that breast cancer could be prevented. Women who participated in the BCS practice were more likely to have a doctor who spoke to them about breast cancer, believing that they were in good health, that the cancer could be prevented, or that the cancer could be inherited. The majority wanted to know if they had cancer and felt their health needs were met. The main reasons given for not planning BCS were lack of doctor's advice, fear and embarrassment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a variety of channels (health care providers, media, breast cancer survivors, community leaders) should be used to create culturally appropriate breast cancer intervention programs and to create increased awareness of breast cancer, MSC and the benefits of early detection. breast cancer. Implementation of these measures will reduce breast cancer death rates among Arabic-speaking women living in the State of Qatar.",0,0,
253,Beliefs about mammography screening in women presenting to the emergency department for non-urgent care,"INTRODUCTION: One in 8 women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. Despite the evidence that mammography is an effective method of early detection, some vulnerable groups, such as those who use the emergency room as a medical home, do not follow mammography screening guidelines and experience different death rates from breast cancer. The aim of this study was to explore differences in beliefs about mammography screening among women presenting to the emergency department for non-urgent care and ultimately to develop interventions that promote mammography for this vulnerable population. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between the stage of readiness to adopt mammography behavior and barriers, benefits, and perceived susceptibility by applying scales of risks, benefits, and barriers to a sample of 110 women admitted to the emergency department of a public hospital for preterm labor. They were sitting in the non-urgent complaints or emergency room waiting room. We also collected sociodemographic information and readiness stage. RESULTS: Mammography compliance was approximately 60%. Most of the women who didn't follow current guidelines were considerate. Those who did not consider screening were significantly less likely to perceive themselves as at risk of developing breast cancer. Women with greater barriers to mammography benefited less from getting a mammogram. African-American women think they see less benefit from getting a mammogram. CONCLUSION: The mammography presentation was conveniently placed in the emergency room waiting room, given the suboptimal rate at which this population was screened. Beliefs about mammography differ for women and minority women at various stages of adopting mammography. Understanding these differences will allow tailoring the intervention to population in this setting. Emergency nurses are an important and sometimes the only point of health care for patients who come to the emergency room routinely. Therefore, they have a valuable opportunity to provide cancer screening promotional messages. In this setting, it is critical that nurses understand the complexity of providing this information and the need to do so.",0,0,
254,Beneficial and harmful effects of enhanced feedback on physicians' clinical teaching performance,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether clinical teaching skills can be improved by providing increased student feedback to teachers. METHODS: A randomized, controlled study included 42 physicians and 39 assistants from the Indiana University School of Medicine Department of Medicine who trained 110 students in medical service rotations for one-month periods in 1994. Prior to teaching the rotations, intervention group teachers received norm-referenced, graphic summaries of instructional performances rated by students. At mid-month, intervention group teachers received students' scores, which were boosted by individualized instructional effectiveness guidelines based on the Stanford Faculty Improvement Program framework. Linear models were used to analyze the students' average scores for teaching behavior at the middle and end of the month. Independent variables included performance ratings, intervention status, teacher status, teaching experience, and interactions with baseline ratings. RESULTS: Complex interactions with core performance were found at the middle and end of the month for most instructional categories. Intervention group teachers with high baseline performance scores had higher student scores than control group teachers with similar baseline scores""; intervention group teachers with low baseline performance scores scored lower than control group teachers with comparable baseline scores. Medium or high baseline Residents with comparable baseline scores scored higher than physicians with comparable baseline scores; Assistants with low baseline scores performed similarly to GPs with comparable baseline scores. CONCLUSION: Baseline performance is important for targeting teachers most likely to benefit from enhanced student feedback. Teaching The possible deterioration in performance warrants a reconsideration of the allocation of students' scores to teachers with low baseline performance scores.",0,0,
255,Benefits and Harms of Pharmacological Treatment for Female Urinary Incontinence,"Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) in women adversely affects quality of life. Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review on drugs for emergency UI in women. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCIRUS, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 1966 to November 2011. Study Selection: Randomized, controlled studies (RCTs) are reported in English. Data Extraction: Outcome rates and risk of bias were extracted using a standardized form to combine the absolute risk differences and calculate the number of attributable events per 1000 patients treated with a 95% CI. Data Synthesis: 94 RCTs were found suitable. The pooled analyzes found that, among emergency UI drugs, 130 of 1000 women treated with fesoterodine (CI, 58 to 202), with tolterodine 85 (CI, 40 to 129), with oxybutynin 114 (CI, 64 to 163) were associated with continence. proved to be restored. ), 107 with solifenacin (CI, 58 to 156) and 114 with trospium (CI, 83 to 144). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 31 per 1000 treated with fesoterodine (CI, 10 to 56), 63 oxybutynin (CI, 12 to 127), 18 trospium (CI, 4 to 33), and 13 solifenacin (CI, 1 to 26). The studies' inconsistent descriptions of reduction in UI and quality of life hindered evidence synthesis. Limitation: Evidence for improvements in quality of life and comparative effectiveness with drugs was limited, and evidence for the effects of race, baseline severity of UI, and comorbid conditions on treatment success was inconclusive. Conclusion: Overall, emergency UI medications showed similar minor benefits. Therapeutic choices should take into account the harm profile. Evidence on long-term adherence and safety of treatments is lacking. Primary Source of Funding: Agency for Health Research and Quality.",0,0,
256,"Benzodiazepines, opioids and driving: an overview of experimental research","ISSUES: Traffic accidents contribute significantly to the overall injury burden in Australia and the risk of injury is associated with the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in the driver's blood. Increasingly, some of the most commonly identified drugs include prescription drugs, the most notable of which are benzodiazepines and opioids. However, empirical research on the effects of prescription psychoactive drugs on driving behavior is scarce. APPROACH: This article provides an overview of experimental studies investigating the effects of benzodiazepines and opioids at prescribed doses on driving ability and points to future directions for research. KEY FINDINGS: There is growing epidemiological evidence linking the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines and opioids to an increased risk of accidents. However, the available experimental literature remains unclear. Limitations in study methodologies have resulted in inconsistent findings. APPLICATIONS: Limited experimental evidence is available to inform policy and guidelines regarding eligibility for driving for patients taking prescription benzodiazepines and opioids. CONCLUSION: More experimental research is needed to elucidate the effects of these drugs on driving under varying conditions and in different medical contexts. This will ensure that physicians prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids are well informed and appropriately advise patients about the risks of driving while taking these drugs.",0,0,

258,Best practice in the management of primary nocturnal enuresis in children: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary leakage of urine at night in a child of expected dry age and physical health. The prevalence of this condition in Australia is estimated at 18.9% in children aged 5 to 12 years; 19% of boys and 16% of 5-year-old girls wet the bed at least once a month. Bedwetting is more common in boys up to the age of 13, and in girls after this age. Nocturnal enuresis has a spontaneous recovery rate of approximately 14%, but up to 3% of children remain enuretic as adults. Although this condition is pathologically benign, it can have serious social and psychological repercussions for the patient, including effects on self-esteem, school achievement, parental disapproval, and even sexual activity in later life. Despite the volume of information available for enuresis management, most of the research has been done outside of Australia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish management guidelines for nocturnal enuresis in children specific to Australian clinical practice. CRITERIA TO INCLUDE: This review includes systematic reviews or concurrent controlled studies (randomized controlled trials (RCT), pseudo-randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS), and pre- and post-trial controlled (CBA)) ), to examine the effectiveness of interventions for managing nocturnal enuresis in children up to 16 years of age. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all available evidence. Cochrane and other health technology review websites were searched for available systematic reviews. The Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched for recent randomized controlled trials and controlled trials (1990 to 2007). The reference lists of all the articles reached for the relevant essays were searched. These reviews and guidelines were summarized and presented to an advisory panel of nurse continence consultants and clinicians to ensure compliance with Australian clinical practice. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: The methodological quality of all studies was assessed by two reviewers who used the JBI critical evaluation forms for the experimental studies included in the JBI-MAStARI software. This tool was used to identify all sources of bias. When there was disagreement between the two reviewers, a third reviewer made the decision. RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews, eight recent studies, and two guidelines were used in the development of these guidelines. Briefly, management recommendations include: CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of nocturnal enuresis and the negative psychosocial sequelae that may result from this condition, management is both readily available and effective. APPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The practice of managing nocturnal enuresis in children should begin with addressing any evidence of both daytime wetting and constipation. Following this, less invasive behavioral therapies should be tried. If these measures fail, the use of alarms with or without short-term desmopressin administration may be attempted. Other interventions have not yet been conclusively proven to be effective and should be carefully considered. However, it should be stressed that the vast majority of children will become continent at some future time point, with or without benefit from the interventions. APPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: While it is clear that some behavioral modalities, alarms and desmopressin may be effective interventions, the evidence for other treatments is less conclusive. However, the observation that even alarms and/or desmopressin do not work for all children suggests that research to determine the efficacy of other interventions (especially behavioral and complementary therapies) should be conducted in large, carefully designed RCTs.",0,0,
259,Best strategies for practicing clinical pathways in an emergency room setting: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Background The clinical pathway is a tool that operationalizes best evidence recommendations and clinical practice guidelines in an accessible format for Â¡Â®point-of-careÂ¡Â¯ management by multidisciplinary healthcare teams in hospital settings. While high-quality, expert-developed clinical pathways have many potential benefits, their impact has been limited by variable delivery strategies and inadequate research designs. The best strategies for implementing migration pathways into hospital settings are unknown. This study will attempt to develop and comprehensively evaluate the best strategies for the effective local application of externally developed specialist clinical pathways. Design/methods We will develop a theory-based and knowledge-based, user-informed intervention strategy to implement two pediatric clinical pathways: asthma and gastroenteritis. Using a balanced incomplete block design, we will randomly select 16 community emergency departments to receive the intervention for one clinical pathway and act as controls for the alternative clinical pathway, thus conducting two clusters of randomized controlled trials to evaluate this implementation intervention. A minimization procedure will be used to randomly select sites. Response sites will receive a specific strategy to support full clinical pathway implementation. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation strategy by measuring the relevant process and clinical outcomes. The primary process outcome will be the presence of an appropriately completed clinical pathway on the chart for the patients involved. Primary clinical outcomes for each clinical pathway include: “AsthmaÂ¡Âªproportion of patients with asthma appropriately treated with corticosteroids in the emergency room and at discharge”; and proportion of involved patients appropriately treated with oral rehydration therapy for GastroenteritisÂ¡ÂªData sources include chart audits, administrative databases. , environmental surveys and qualitative interviews. We will also conduct an overall process evaluation to evaluate the implementation strategy and an economic analysis to evaluate the costs and benefits of implementation. Discussion This study will contribute to the body of evidence supporting effective strategies for the implementation of clinical pathways and, ultimately, to improve clinical pathways. will reduce research gaps to practice by making the best evidence care recommendations functional through its effective use.",0,0,
260,Best practice intervention for the care of self-injured patients,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of a best practice intervention to guide nurse practitioners (NPs) caring for self-harming individuals. DATA SOURCES: Evidence on which the guideline is based includes six descriptive studies and expert clinical opinion articles. The framework for the development of the guideline is a systematic process for obtaining and analyzing the best available evidence, developing a theory-based intervention, and recommending a system for continuous evaluation of the intervention's effectiveness. RESULTS: The guide is an information sheet that includes a definition of self-injury, background of the problem, target audience and response. The three components of the intervention are: (a) the NP's self-assessment of values, beliefs, and assumptions about self-harming individuals; (b) a focused, in-depth assessment of the client; and (c) therapeutic strategies to address the emotional, social, and biological dimensions of self-injury. PRACTICES FOR PRACTICE: This Best Practice Intervention guide for the Care of Self-Injured Patients provides direction for NPs to effectively address preventable, self-harming behavior. More studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of the use of the guideline and the intervention.",0,0,
261,Better drug by default,"Background. American healthcare is moving to electronic doctor ordering. These computerized systems are unique in that they allow for custom order interfaces. While these systems offer great benefits, there are also potential pitfalls, as behavioral science shows that the format of electronic interfaces can affect decision making. Current research specifically examines how defaults in electronic order templates affect physicians' treatment decisions and medical errors. Methods Forty-five medical assistants completed order sets for 3 medical case studies. Participants were randomly assigned to receive order sets with either ""accept"" defaults (visible but unselected options) or ""disable"" defaults (visible and preselected options). The results compare error rates between conditions and examine the inclusion and opt-out defaults and the type and severity of the most common errors. Results. Deactivation defaults resulted in more product orders and especially increased commission errors (overorders) compared to activation defaults. However, opt-in defaults resulted in fewer orders, while also increasing omission errors. Given the severity of the errors, the default effects seem to be limited to less serious errors. Solution. The defaults used in electronic order sets influence medical treatment decisions when their impact on the patient's health is low. This model implies that doctors cognitively override wrongly assumed choices, but only up to a point, and imply tradeoffs that maximize accuracy and minimize cognitive effort. The results show that defaults for low-impact elements in spreadsheets require careful attention, as doctors are less likely to override them.",1,1,
262,Better practices in collaborative mental health care: an evidence-based analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the experimental literature to identify better practices in collaborative mental health care in the primary care setting. METHODS: A review of Canadian and international literature using Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Library, and other databases yielded over 900 relevant reports, of which 38 met the inclusion criteria. A systematic review and descriptive analysis is presented, along with key results and best practices. CONCLUSIONS: Successful collaboration requires preparation, time and supporting structures based on pre-existing clinical relationships. Collaborative practice probably thrives most when clinicians are together and the most effective place is familiar and not stigmatizing for patients. The degree of cooperation does not predict clinical outcome. Enhanced collaboration paired with treatment guidelines or protocols offers significant benefits over intervention alone in major depression. Systematic follow-up was a strong predictor of positive outcome in collaborative care for depression. There was no clear relationship between collaborative efforts to improve drug compliance and clinical outcomes. Collaboration alone has not been shown to provide skill transfer in PCP knowledge or behavior in the treatment of depression. Service reengineering is also required, designed to support changes in the delivery patterns of primary care providers. Enhanced patient education was part of many studies with good results. Training was usually provided by someone other than PCP. Collaborative interventions that are part of a research protocol can be difficult to sustain over the long term without ongoing funding. Consumer choice regarding treatment modality may be important in treatment participation in collaborative care (for example, having the option to choose psychotherapy versus medication). CONCLUSIONS: A body of experimental literature evaluating the impact of enhanced collaboration on patient outcomes is now available – particularly in depressive disorders. Better practices in collaborative mental health care are starting to emerge.",0,0,
263,Between peer interviews and controlled trials: hospital-based neurologists' sources of information and practical knowledge in the treatment of stroke patients.,"The application of evidence-based and standardized knowledge is an important foundation for coordinated and effective clinical work. A multicenter study conducted in 30 clinical neurology departments and involving 99 junior and senior registrants addressed practical knowledge of stroke management through open structured oral interviews between physicians and analyzed for guideline compliance. In addition, participants were asked to rate the usefulness of various sources of information and describe the sources of information used according to aspects of practical knowledge addressed. Relevant department managers were asked about the medical information resources available in their clinics. Physicians in almost all hospitals had access to a library and the Internet. However, departments differed in knowledge management (frequency and type of medical education, quality management, participation in research activities). According to other studies, the most frequently reported sources of information are textbooks, journals, and clinical studies. For most resources, usefulness rankings largely correspond to user behavior rankings. Both were only poor predictors of inter-physician and guideline compliance. These are more closely related to intra-departmental homogeneity of practical knowledge than to inter-departmental and guideline compliance. Intra-departmental homogeneity is enhanced through the use of up-to-date, published and evidence-based resources and up-to-date interaction with clinical colleagues. Compliance with the guideline was related to the use of databases and professional journals. Preferring colleagues from outpatient practices decreased both inter-physician and guideline compliance. There seems to be still untapped potential for intra-departmental knowledge management, such as medical education, the application and use of guidelines, and current discussions, that could improve the homogeneity and relevance of practical knowledge applied by clinicians.",0,0,
264,Between control and therapy: an evolutionary concept analysis of private observation in acute psychiatric wards.,"OBJECTIVE: Private surveillance is a seriously invasive and resource-intensive intervention. Scientifically conceptualizing this measure is necessary for further research and application. METHODS: Evolutionary concept analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Established antecedents, qualifications and outcomes of private observation range from control and therapy to the safety of patients and the scope of professionals. It consists of antecedents, justification (indication, evaluation, prescription), sources (internal guidelines, architectural structures, information), and context factors (security needs, personal attitudes). Attitudes identified are the area of tension between organization (quality, change of caregiver, length, location), intervention (relationship, reappraisal, transparency), as well as control and therapy. Outcomes consist of side effects (patients, nurses, resources) and conflicts (ethical dilemmas, role conflicts). CONCLUSION: Society and discipline have influenced the concept over time, and it is recommended to make a distinction between the preventive and controlling model and the therapeutic approach.",0,0,
265,Between scientific practice and therapy: ethical evaluation,"The development of bioscience and biotechnology over the past three decades has had a tremendous impact on medicine. New techniques have emerged and new types of treatment have emerged and continue to be used. As theories about pathogenesis and the causes of disease change, new therapeutic drugs are constantly becoming available on the market. The way new technologies and drugs are introduced increasingly includes an experimental phase in which animals and humans are used to test research results. As a rule, these experiments are carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, Helsinki 1964, Tokyo, 1975). The guidelines of this Declaration deal with the ethical aspects of these experiments involving human subjects. Although the guides were intended to have a global import, it is still a fact that some of them are the subject of discussion in various parts of the world. They seem to have a cultural background (for example, respect for the individual) and bioscientists sometimes argue that they should be considered unscientific constraints for this reason. On the basis of a general philosophical and ethical consideration, this article will discuss how ethical principles belong to the heart of biomedicine and biology. A common interest of researchers, clinicians, patients and scientists is to consider the ethical implications of research results before any valuable information is said to have been obtained. The application of monoclonal antibodies in clinical practice can be seen as an example of this argument.",0,0,
266,Beyond domestic violence screening: a systems model approach in a managed care setting,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of screening guidelines for domestic violence has been challenging. The versatile ""systems model"" can provide an effective tool for improving domestic violence screening, identification and response in the healthcare setting. METHODS: We have developed: (1) a systems model approach that uses tools to effectively refer, assess, and report domestic violence; (2) materials to be distributed to female patients; (3) training for social work and mental health clinicians to provide family domestic violence assessment and (4) strong links to the community SETTING: A non-profit managed care facility in Richmond, California PARTICIPANTS: Employees and members of the managed care plan MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Increased screening for domestic violence by clinicians; (2) increased awareness of the health facility as a resource for domestic violence assistance;"" and (3) increased member satisfaction with the health plan's efforts to address domestic violence. RESULTS: The number of clinician referrals and self-referrals of patients to an onsite domestic violence evaluator more than doubled. The pre-intervention and post-intervention telephone survey of members seen for routine checkup showed an increase in members' recall to be asked about domestic violence. After the intervention, statistically significant increases were seen in members' perception of the health plan's impact on the health effects of domestic violence (p<0.0001) and members' satisfaction with the health plan's efforts to address this issue (p<0.0001). RESULTS: A systems model approach improved domestic violence services in a managed care health setting within 1 year and influenced clinicians' behavior and health plan members' experiences. This successful practice makes it possible to address critical research questions about the impact of a healthcare intervention for survivors of domestic violence in a managed healthcare setting.",0,0,
267,Big pharma and healthcare: an insoluble conflict of interest between private enterprise and public health,"landmark paper on Game Theory showed that the maximization of individual profits necessarily endangered the public good and ""requires a fundamental expansion in morality"" as the problem has no technical solution (1). We propose here that public health as a public good emerges as a serious example of this problem. Recent events and reports show that there is an increasing mismatch between the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and those of public health. Johnson & Johnson has illegally and effectively off-labeled Propulsid for children, despite internal documents that raise safety concerns. Death in the drug trial was described as a ""trade secret"". Topol wrote in Vioxx: ""Unfortunately, it is clear that Merck's commercial interest has exceeded its concern over the drug's toxicity"" (2). Increasingly, concerns are expressed by academics and major journal editors about the type and quality of published evidence, often biased towards the effectiveness of new products. The industry, which funds more than 80% of research, sets a research agenda driven more by marketing than clinical considerations. Intelligent statistical and epidemiological tactics help achieve desired results. The marketing budget is much more than the research budget. Mass advertising to doctors and the public is getting more and more sophisticated: ghostwriting, professional guidelines, targeting consumer groups, and manipulating the media for disease trafficking. Widespread lobbying and political ties limit the independence of regulatory agencies. The obligation to shareholders to preempt public health issues is not unique to the pharmaceutical industry. The chemical, tobacco, and food industries share similar tactics: raising doubts about safety issues, recruiting researchers, infiltrating universities, boards, the media, and legislatures. In contrast, powerful and inexpensive health promotion activities that are not adequately supported by industry because they are too cheap and not patented are markedly underutilized: behavior modification technologies (for example, cardiac rehabilitation), palliative care, and the use of older, effective and safe drugs - all of which are the industry's predecessors. can benefit from marketing and quality tools. Free market successes appear to pose insoluble challenges to social justice in public health, as the sick, the poor and the least educated are most affected.",0,0,
268,Binge eating disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The best treatment options for binge eating disorder are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence on the benefits and harms of psychological and pharmacological treatments for adults with binge eating disorder. DATA SOURCES: English publications in EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Academic OneFile, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until 18 November 2015 and MEDLINE until 12 May 2016. STUDY SELECTION: 9 waiting-list-controlled psychological studies and 25 placebo-controlled studies = 6) treatments evaluating pharmacological (n = 19) or combination (n = 19). All were randomized trials with a low or moderate risk of bias. DATA DRAWING: 2 reviewers independently extracted research data, assessed the risk of bias, and rated the degree of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapist-led cognitive behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, and second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) reduced binge eating frequency and increased binge avoidance (relative risk, 4.95 [95% CI, 3.06 to 8.00], 2 .61 [CI, 2.04 to 3.33] and 1.67 [CI, 1.24 to 2.26] Lisdexamfetamine (mean difference [MD], -6.50 [CI, -8.82 to -4.18]) and SGAs (MD, -3.84 [CI, -6.55 to -1.13]) reduced obsessions and compulsions related to binge eating, and SGAs reduced depression symptoms (MD, -1.97 [CI, -3.67 to -0.28]). pain, gastrointestinal distress, sleep disturbance, and sympathetic nervous system stimulation occurred more frequently with lisdexamfetamine than with placebo (relative risk range, 1.63 to 4.28).Other forms of cognitive behavioral therapy and topiramate also increased abstinence and increased binge eating frequency and associated Topiramate decreased weight and increased sympathetic nervous system stimulation, and lisdexamfetamine increased weight and decreased appetite. LIMITATIONS: Most study participants were overweight or obese white women between the ages of 20 and 40. Many treatments have been studied in just one study. Outcomes were measured inconsistently between trials and were rarely evaluated after the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, SGAs, and topiramate reduced binge eating and related psychopathology, and reduced lisdexamfetamine and topiramate weight in adults with binge eating disorder.",0,0,
269,Biomedical and behavioral research in nursing homes: guidelines for ethical research,"As nursing homes become increasingly important venues for biomedical and behavioral research, researchers must address ethical issues such as the increasing vulnerability and high prevalence of mental and physical disorders in the nursing home population. Obtaining valid informed consent is one of the many difficult problems faced by the researcher in the nursing home. Efforts should be made to include family and staff members, as well as nursing home residents, in reviewing the research. The benefits and burdens of research protocols should be distributed fairly, and potential conflicts of interest for staff and physicians should be minimized or potential adverse effects should be improved. Appropriate attention to these ethical concerns can facilitate research in the nursing home and continue to protect vulnerable residents. We present recommended guidelines for the ethical conduct of research in nursing homes to encourage discussion among investigators, nursing home staff and residents, residents' families, and ethicists.",0,0,
270,Bipolar disorder center for Pennsylvanians: implementing an efficacy trial to improve treatment of at-risk patients,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescents, the elderly, African Americans, and rural residents with bipolar disorder are less likely to be diagnosed, receive adequate treatment, stay in treatment after diagnosis, and have favorable outcomes than their middle-aged, white, urban counterparts. The Center for Bipolar Disorder for Pennsylvanians (BDCP) study is designed to address these disparities. This report highlights the methods used to recruit, screen, and enroll a cohort of difficult-to-recruit individuals with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Fields of study included three private clinics for bipolar disorder and one rural behavioral health clinic in a university setting. Work operations have been standardized and all work personnel have been trained in work procedures. Various strategies were used for recruitment. RESULTS: It was possible to apply the same assessment and screening protocol in settings regardless of whether they had a history of implementing research protocols. This protocol could also be used across the age spectrum, in urban and rural areas, and in a racially diverse cohort of participants. At four sites, 515 people with bipolar disorder were enrolled as a result of these methods (69 African Americans and 446 non-African Americans). Although clinical features at study entry did not differ appreciably between African Americans and non-African Americans, the pathways to treatment were significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous recruitment and evaluation procedures can be successfully implemented in different settings and with different patient groups, thereby facilitating access to high-quality care for individuals who often do not receive appropriate care for bipolar disorder.",0,0,
271,Books and reading: the evidence-based standard of care whose time has come,"Reach and Read (ROR) is the only clinical activity used in the United States that has been systematically evaluated to support child development in primary care. The ROR intervention is simple: clinicians advise high-risk children and parents on the benefits of reading aloud as well as giving books directly at each pediatric visit of children aged 6 months to 5 years. ROR is built on a substantial evidence base for the value of reading aloud to young children. Studies evaluating ROR from different regions from subjects of different races and multiple outcome measures are consistently positive. From its first single center at Boston City Hospital in 1989 to over 4,600 clinical centers in 2010, more than 30,000 clinicians have distributed more than 6.2 million books annually to 3.9 million children in the United States. Future efforts for ROR include integrating the mental health competencies found in American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines into the ROR paradigm as part of residency and clinician training, improving quality to ensure adherence to intervention, and expanding pediatric clinician involvement in local early childhood/school readiness. community efforts. Finally, the most important future goal is for government agencies to adopt as best practice the delivery of developmentally appropriate books to high-risk families and advice on reading aloud.",0,0,
272,borderline personality disorder in adolescence,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common and severe mental disorder associated with severe functional impairment and a high suicide rate. BPD is often associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, high burden on families and caregivers, continued resource use, and high treatment costs. BPD has been a controversial diagnosis in adolescents, but this is no longer confirmed. Recent evidence suggests that BPD is as reliable and valid among adolescents as it is in adults, and that adolescents with BPD may benefit from early intervention. As a result, adolescent BPD is now recognized in psychiatric classification systems and national treatment guidelines. This review aims to inform practitioners in the field of adolescent health about the nature of BPD in adolescence and the benefits of early detection and intervention. BPD diagnosis and treatment should be considered as part of routine practice in adolescent mental health to improve the well-being and long-term prognosis of these individuals.",0,0,

274,Breaking new ground: challenging current asthma guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Although we have international guidelines and several national guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, asthma control in many children and adults is still inadequate. In this article, we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe key issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines specifically for use in primary care. CONCLUSION: Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. Current evidence-based guidelines are predominantly written from the perspective of the patient with a clear diagnosis of asthma and do not tend to take into account the heterogeneity of asthma or take into account individual patient variations, differences in practice in response to treatment or needs. local differences in availability and cost of settings or therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials designed to determine the efficacy of treatment under ideal conditions may not be applicable to 'real world' clinical practice, where patients are not selected, follow-up is less frequent, and efficacy - treatment benefit - treatment benefit. routine clinical practice--the most relevant outcome. In addition, most guidelines view asthma in isolation rather than taking into account asthma and other factors that may affect response to asthma treatment, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, smoking, compliance, and genetic factors. Once these links are recognized, guidelines rarely offer practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is some evidence that general practitioners are not convinced of the applicability of asthma guidelines to practice settings, particularly when the authors of the guidelines work primarily in specialist practice. CONCLUSION: The development of country-specific guidelines, or ideally local guidelines, may provide more practical solutions for asthma management and may explain regional factors affecting patient selection and adherence to treatment. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational studies are needed in addition to randomized controlled trials to evaluate the real-world efficacy of treatments, and such evidence needs to be considered by the guideline authors. Finally, there is a need for practical tools to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of asthma to supplement the treatment information provided in clinical practice guidelines for asthma, and factors responsible for poor control such as associated allergic rhinitis, limited compliance, and smoking behavior.",0,0,
275,"Breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening behaviors among African American women: Black beauticians promoting wellness program","BACKGROUND: African American women have higher breast cancer death rates than their white counterparts. Studies suggest that this is partly due to the cancer being discovered at a later stage, emphasizing the importance of promoting early detection of breast cancer in this population. To guide the creation of a breast cancer education intervention and to help focus health-promoting efforts of other health educators and clinicians, this study explored whether a cohort of African-American women living in San Diego would demonstrate sufficient basic knowledge about breast cancer screening. and adherence to commonly recommended screening guidelines. METHODS: African American women (N = 1,055) from San Diego, California participated in a beauty salon-based survey about breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices. The ages of the women ranged from 20 to 94 years, with a mean age of 42.20 (SD = 13.53) years. Thirty-four percent reported completing college and/or some postgraduate education and 52 percent reported having formal education after college or post-secondary education. Seventy-five percent of the sample reported working outside their home. Participating beauticians and salons were recruited through word of mouth advice from highly respected African-American community leaders. RESULTS: Salon customers reported low compliance rates with recommended breast cancer screening guidelines. Of the 1,055 participants, 31% reported doing breast self-exams every month. Of respondents aged 40 and over, 57% reported having had a clinical breast exam and 43% reported having had a mammogram in the past year. Breast cancer knowledge was associated with compliance with screening guidelines. While women acknowledged the serious health threat posed by breast cancer and the importance of early detection of breast cancer, only 30% of women reported that they were well informed about the disease. Many participants showed a lack of basic knowledge about breast cancer. The Health Belief Model assumes that access to such information is an important element in engaging in browsing behavior. CONCLUSION: Data from this study reflect the increasing need for breast cancer education for African American women. In light of the important available information on breast cancer, these data reinforce the need for more breast cancer education programs that are clearly aimed at attracting the attention of African American women.",0,0,
276,"Closing the gap between pragmatic intervention design and theory: using behavioral science tools to modify an existing quality improvement program to implement ""Sepsis Six""","BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a 40% mortality rate and can be halved if the evidence-based ""Sepsis Six"" care package is administered within 1 hour. UK audit shows low enforcement rates. Interventions to improve this had minimal impact. Quality improvement programs can be further developed using theoretical frameworks (The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)) to replace existing interventions by identifying impacts on clinical behavior and selecting appropriate content. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how to use this process to replace an intervention designed using plan-do-run-action (PDSA) cycles that had partial success in improving the implementation of Sepsis Six in a hospital. METHODS: The factors affecting the practice were investigated by using TDF to analyze the interviews with 34 health professionals. The nursing team that developed and facilitated the intervention used data to select changes using the Behavior Change Technique (BCT) Taxonomy (v1) and APEASE criteria: affordability, viability, effectiveness, acceptability, safety, and equity. RESULTS: Five themes were identified that impact implementation and drive response modification. These are: (1) ""knowing what to do and why"" (TDF covers knowledge, social/professional role and identity)"";"" (2) ""risks and benefits"" (beliefs about outcomes), belief in the effectiveness of the package that acts as a lever for administration against fear of harming patients, for example, through fluid overload acting as a barrier to practice""; (3) ""cooperation"" (social influences, social/professional role and identity), eg doctor/nurse conflict acting as a lever against team collaboration""; (4) ""empowerment and support"" (abilities, beliefs about social/professional role and identity, behavioral regulation, social influences), e.g. staff involvement in intervention development, lack of confidence to challenge peers' decisions not to act as a barrier"";"" (5) ""staffing levels"" (environmental context and resources), eg the lack of doctors preventing nighttime practice.

279,Physician-initiated brief smoking cessation strategies for clinical oncology settings: a trial coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.,"OBJECTIVE: Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, reduces the effectiveness of treatment and worsens quality of life, approximately one third of patients who smoked before diagnosis continue to smoke. The efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation therapy was evaluated because patients had regular contact with oncologists. METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or the National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence absence at 6 and 12 months after study entry. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups at the 6-month follow-up, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention groups. Intervention groups (13.3%) at 12-month follow-up. Patients with head and neck cancer or lung cancer who started smoking after age 16 years, initially reported using a cessation self-help guide or therapy, and quit smoking in the last 6 months were more likely to quit at 6 months. the desire to leave the foundation. Patients who smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes a day, had head and neck or lung cancer, had tried a group quit program, and showed a greater desire to quit at baseline were more likely to quit at 12 months. Finally, there was greater adherence to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in intervention compared to the usual care group. CONCLUSION: While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients may increase physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physicians' smoking cessation interventions do not provide significant gains in long-term cessation rates among cancer patients.",0,0,

281,Capacity building for antiretroviral practice in South Africa: a qualitative evaluation of the PALSA PLUS nurse education program.,"BACKGROUND: South Africa has recently launched a national antiretroviral treatment program. This has created an urgent need for nurse education in the practice of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The PALSA PLUS program provides guidelines and training for primary care (PHC) nurses in the management of adult pulmonary diseases and HIV/AIDS, including ART. A process assessment was conducted to document education, explore perceptions of the value of education, and compare the PALSA PLUS education approach (used in intervention areas) with the provincial education model. The evaluation was conducted in conjunction with a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of PALSA PLUS nurse training (Trial reference number ISRCTN24820584). METHODS: Qualitative methods were used, including participant observation of the training sessions, focus group discussions, and interviews. The data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Nurses were highly interested in PALSA PLUS training, not only in terms of components specific to ART, but also in terms of lung health. In contrast to the one-time centralized training provided to ART nurses only in non-intervention clinics, continuing onsite training of all PHC nurses includes nurses' experience of support for their work, not only ongoing experiential learning but also supervision and emotional support, but also health care provider behavior change and for ongoing administrative review of all these infrastructure and system-level changes needed to facilitate guideline implementation. In contrast to only ART nurses, training of all PHC nurses in the use of PALSA PLUS guidelines was also perceived to facilitate the integration of AIDS care into the clinical context better. CONCLUSION: PALSA PLUS training has successfully engaged all PHC nurses with a comprehensive approach to various diseases affecting both HIV positive and negative patients. PHC nurse education for integrated systems-based interventions should be prioritized on the ART funding agenda. Education for individual provider behavior change, however, is only one aspect of ongoing system-wide interventions needed to deliver lasting improvements in patient care in the context of an overloaded and under-resourced PHC system.",0,0,

283,Building Statewide Infrastructure for Academic Support for Students with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,"OBJECTIVES: To focus attention on statewide capacity building to support students with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)/concussion. METHOD: Consensus building process with a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and State Department of Education staff. CONCLUSIONS: The white paper presents the group consensus on key components of a statewide educational infrastructure to support the management of students with mTBI. The nature of mTBI and the recovery process are briefly explained, particularly in relation to its effects on school learning and performance. State and local policy considerations are then highlighted to encourage the implementation of a coherent process. Five key components have been identified for establishing a statewide infrastructure for students with mTBI, including (1) definition and training of the interdisciplinary school team, (2) professional development of the school and medical communities, and (3) protocols for identification, assessment, and progress monitoring. , (4) a flexible set of intervention strategies to meet students' recovery needs, and (5) systematic protocols for active communication among medical, school, and family team members. The need for research to guide effective program implementation is emphasized. CONCLUSION: This guiding framework seeks to assist in the development of support structures to rescue students with mTBI to optimize academic outcomes. Until more evidence is found about academic regulation and other school-based support, education systems should follow current best practice guidelines.",0,0,

Translation of evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice has been inconsistent. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of guideline-based care recommendations given to physicians as they type orders at computer workstations. Working Setting. Inner city academic general internal medicine application. Study design. Randomized, controlled trial of 246 physicians (25 percent faculty general internists, 75 percent internists) and 20 outpatient pharmacists. We enrolled 706 primary care patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Care recommendations regarding medications and monitoring were communicated to a random half of the doctors and pharmacists while typing orders or filling prescriptions using computer workstations. A 2×2 factorial randomization of practice sessions and pharmacists resulted in four patient groups: physician intervention, pharmacist intervention, both interventions, and controls. Data Extraction/Collection Methods. Compliance with guidelines and clinical activity were assessed using patients' electronic medical records. Health-related quality of life, medication adherence, and satisfaction with care were assessed using telephone questionnaires. Key Findings. During their year in the study, patients made an average of five planned primary care visits. There were no differences between groups in adherence to care recommendations, generic or condition-specific quality of life, satisfaction with physicians or pharmacists, medication adherence, emergency room visits, or hospitalizations. The doctors who received the intervention significantly increased their overall health care costs. Physicians' attitudes towards the guidelines were mixed. Results.

290,Can line clinicians master the conceptual complexities of dialectical behavior therapy? Evaluation of the training program of the State Ministry of Mental Health,"Dialectical behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder quickly gained widespread popularity, with the development of educational initiatives by the Department of Mental Health in at least two states in the US. Efficacy data published by the treatment's creator, Marsha Linehan, and her colleagues likely explain this popularity, at least in part. However, the complexity of DBT raises a fundamental question regarding these broader applications: can clinicians from diverse backgrounds gain a common and complex understanding of treatment theory? The clinical utility of a treatment is largely based on its ease of diffusion (APA, Guideline development template: Interventions for the psychosocial aspects of mental and physical disorders. Washington, DC: Author, 1995) and in this context DBT - a complex, multifaceted approach - may appear vulnerable. This vulnerability is heightened when institutional adoption involves the collaboration of large numbers of clinicians who, despite performing a variety of roles, still need to develop a common understanding of treatment. Using a detailed review of DBT knowledge, we evaluated the conceptual mastery of 109 clinicians trained through a Government Department of Mental Health initiative. Performance in the exam is particularly associated with DBT training. Prior training or background in behavioral therapy accounted for little variability, suggesting that clinicians in different roles have acquired reasonable intellectual mastery of this complex model.",0,0,

SUBJECTS: 17 frail stroke patients (8 males, 9 females) with a mean age of 75.8 (SD +/- 9) years and 17 identical subjects who participated in a previous observational study. MAIN MEASURES: Time spent on therapeutic activities was measured using the Behavioral Mapping method. RESULTS: Time spent on therapeutic activities increased significantly from 103.5 minutes measured in our previous study to 156.5 minutes in this study (Z = 2.86""; P < 0.005;"" d' = 1.09) The mean Barthel Index score was 8.8 (SD +/- 4.1). Patients with greater odds were more active, resulting in a significant positive Barthel Index-therapy duration association (r = 0.73, P </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Autonomous administration time increased on weekdays in older fragile comorbid stroke patients. Stimulated and challenged by nurses, patients exercise harder and harder than they can afford. As this guide was developed specifically for nurses, nurses can encourage stroke patients to contribute more to autonomous practice, thereby helping their recovery.",0,0,
292,Can psychological models bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and clinicians' behavior? A randomized controlled trial of an intervention to influence dentists' intention to implement evidence-based practice.,"OBJECTIVE: The delay between the publication of evidence for clinical practice and its implementation by clinicians can be decades. Research using psychological models shows that changing intention is crucial in changing behavior. This study examined an intervention (rehearsal of alternative actions) to change dentists' intention to implement evidence-based practice (EBP) for third molar (TM) management. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial/mail. SETTING: Primary care. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Dentists were randomly selected from the Scottish Dental Practice Board Registry, then randomly distributed to intervention or control groups, and a questionnaire was submitted. The intervention group listed management alternatives to TM extraction prior to intent to TM extraction and the control group did not. Based on psychological models to reduce the frequency of a behavior (EBP is weighted against TM subtraction), pre-listing of alternatives should reduce the intent to subtract. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intention to remove TMs. RESULTS: A total of 99 dentists - 70 Males, 29 Females""; mean age = 41.42 years (SD = 8.62) participated in the study. The intervention significantly influenced the intention to remove TMs as desired. Despite similar background and knowledge of management alternatives, participants had significantly lower subtraction intentions: control group mean (SD) = 0.39 (1.99); intervention group mean (SD) = -0.78 (1.89); mean difference (SE) = 1, 17 (0.42);"" The 95% confidence interval for the difference = 0.34 to 1.99. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this intervention, which successfully affects the proximal predictor of dental EBP-related behavior, may result in improved EBP in a service-level trial. Basing practice interventions and trial methodology on psychological models can effectively bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and practice.",0,1,
293,Can we address depression in vision rehabilitation settings? Professional perspectives on barriers to integrating problem-solving therapy,"OBJECTIVE: Low vision rehabilitation (LVR) is an appropriate context to integrate early, evidence-based psychological interventions, given the high prevalence of untreated depression in adults with visual impairment. This study aims to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to staff-provided telephone-based problem-solving therapy for primary care (PST-PC) offered as an integrated component of LVR. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews developed using the theoretical domain framework (TDF) and the Consolidated Framework for Practice Research (CFIR) were conducted with 21 LVR experts and a clinical psychologist involved in the presentation of the PST-PC. Obstacles and facilitators at the practitioner, client, intervention and organizational level were identified by thematic analysis using a ""theoretical"" approach. RESULTS: Obvious barriers were lack of role recognition for PST-PC implementers (n = 32), unmet customer expectation with PST-PC (n = 28), dissatisfaction with phone delivery (n = 27), and limited institutional awareness of PST. -PC (n = 39). Facilitating factors included a recognized need for evidence-based psychological services (n = 28), clients benefiting from early sessions (n = 38), PST-PC supporting practical skills (n = 26), and extensive PST-PC training (n). . = 36). CONCLUSIONS: PST-PC may provide an accessible early intervention for LVR patients with depressive symptoms. Ongoing practitioner education, clinical support, and screening of potential LVR patients for treatment eligibility are likely to improve delivery in this setting. Implications for rehabilitation Depression is very common among adults participating in low vision rehabilitation (LVR) programs, but few receive support. Clinical guidelines recommend the delivery of integrated care models in rehabilitation settings as early intervention for mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Integrated telephone-based problem-solving therapy (PST-PC) for primary care, provided by trained LVR practitioners, is a practical, skills-based model with the potential to increase access to early psychological intervention in LVR patients with depressive symptoms. LVR patients are generally older, have multiple co-morbidities, and significant functional disability, requiring flexibility in PST-PC delivery and specialist staff training and support in working with older and more complex clients.",0,0,
294,"Can we improve compliance with guidelines for the treatment of lower urinary tract infection? A simple, versatile intervention in out-of-hours services","OBJECTIVES: To improve the antimicrobial prescribing behavior of GPs in large-scale out-of-hours services for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) in women aged 20-80 years, which is considered one of the most common bacterial infections in primary care. care. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used in two regional large-scale out-of-hours services. A simple, multifaceted intervention was proposed in one region (intervention site) over a 16-week period. We observed the diagnoses and prescriptions during the two purification periods at 5 and 17 months. The main outcome measure was the share of suitable and unsuitable prescriptions. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with LUTI ranged from 1.0% to 2.1%. The relative proportion of eligible prescriptions in the response area increased from 26.9% to 69.4%, but then decreased to 40.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, versatile intervention to LUTI therapy during out-of-hours care may improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, although improvement may not be sustained over the long term.",0,1,

297,"Canadian guidelines for the evidence-based treatment of tic disorders: behavioral therapy, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation","This clinical guideline provides recommendations for non-pharmacological treatments for tic disorders. We conducted a systematic literature search for clinical trials on the treatment of tics. An evidence-based review (including 30 studies) and 3 studies on behavioral interventions, 3 studies on deep brain stimulation (DBS), and 3 studies on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) met our inclusion criteria. Based on this evidence, we made strong recommendations for the use of habit-reversing therapy and exposure and response prevention, preferably embedded in a supportive, psychoeducational program and with the option to combine either of these approaches with pharmacotherapy. Although there is evidence for the efficacy of DBS, the quality of this evidence is weak and the risks and burdens of the procedure are delicately balanced with the perceived benefits. Our recommendation is that this intervention continues to be considered an experimental treatment for severe, medically resistant tics with severe limitations to quality of life. We recommend that the procedure be performed only as part of research studies and by physicians who are experts in DBS programming and management of tics. There is no evidence to support the use of TMS in the treatment of tics. However, the procedure is associated with a low rate of known complications and may continue to be evaluated within research protocols. The recommendations we provide are based on current information and further work may result in future revisions.",0,0,
298,Canadian study of clinical status at onset of dialysis 1998-1999: a multicenter prospective study,"OBJECTIVES: The current growth in end-stage renal disease populations has led to increased efforts to understand the impact of dialysis initiation status on long-term outcomes. Our main goal was to improve the understanding of current Canadian practice of nephrology from October 1998 to December 1999. METHODS: Fifteen nephrology centers in 7 provinces participated in a prospective data collection survey. The main outcome of interest was the clinical status at dialysis initiation, determined by: residual renal function, readiness for chronic dialysis, as measured by the presence or absence of permanent peritoneal or hemodialysis access, hemoglobin, and serum albumin. Uremic symptoms at the start of dialysis were also recorded, but in some cases these symptom data were obtained retrospectively. RESULTS: Data were collected from 251 patients over 1-month periods. Patients began dialysis with an average of 3 symptoms, with calculated mean creatinine clearance levels of approximately 10 ml/min. 35% of patients who started dialysis were known to nephrologists for less than 3 months. These patients are more likely to start without permanent access and with lower hemoglobin and albumin levels. Even those known to nephrologists, only 66% had permanent access. CONCLUSIONS: Patients starting dialysis in Canada appear to do so in relative agreement with published guidelines for timing of initiation. Despite a growing awareness of kidney disease, a significant number of patients continue to start dialysis without prior intervention by a nephrologist. Clinical and laboratory parameters of those seen by nephrologists are below optimal according to current guidelines. This survey provides an important basis for future comparisons after implementation of educational strategies for referring physicians and nephrologists.",0,0,
299,Cancer adolescent pathway in France between 1988 and 1997,"We report an adolescent cancer pathway in France, from referral to diagnosis and treatment. All cancer cases diagnosed from 1988 to 1997 (10% of the French population) diagnosed in the nine French population-based cancer registries were included. Treatment of adolescent cancer by pediatricians was rare. Adolescents' cancer management pathway can be summarized as the first visit to the GP, referral to an adult oncologist for hematological malignancies and medical or surgical specialists for solid tumors, treatment in the adult unit, and follow-up by an adult oncologist, adult medical or surgical specialist. specialist or general practitioner. Only 9% of the 15-19 age group enter clinical trial (6% and 3%, respectively, adult and pediatric clinical trial). The inclusion rate varies by diagnosis, with higher for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (39%), non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) (27%), and acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (20%). Only 4% of adolescent cancers, particularly soft tissue sarcomas (14.9%), malignant bone tumors (13.4), central nervous system tumors (6.2%) and NHL (4.4%) are common adult/ treated in pediatric departments. Whatever the reasons for the lack of participation in clinical trials, an ideal model that requires communication and collaboration between all adult and pediatric professionals involved in adolescent cancer treatment should reduce the huge gap in accessing collaborative groups.",0,0,
300,Cancer education among primary care physicians in an underserved community,"INTRODUCTION: Urban minority groups, such as those living in northern Manhattan, are often underserved in cancer prevention and screening practices. Primary care physicians are in a critical position to counsel their patients on these issues and have their patients undergo screening tests. METHODS: Eighty-four primary care physicians in two intervention communities who received educational visits about cancer screening and prevention were compared with 38 doctors in a nearby community who did not receive interventions. Through pre- and post-test interviews over an 18-month period, physicians were asked about their attitudes towards breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate, their knowledge (according to American Cancer Society guidelines), and counseling and screening possibilities. cancers. RESULTS: Comparing the two questionnaires with physicians showed no statistically significant difference in cancer prevention or screening information. However, in the posttest, intervention group physicians identified significantly fewer barriers to practice than control physicians (p<0.05). Overall, although educational visits to inner-city primary care physicians did not appear to significantly alter cancer prevention practices, there was a positive dose-response relationship among the subgroup of participants who received three or more project contacts. RESULTS: We uncovered significant changes in attitude among urban primary care physicians working in northern Manhattan due to academic elaboration. A significant pretest sensitization effect and the small numbers may have masked overall changes in cancer prevention and screening behaviors among physicians due to the intervention.",0,0,
301,Cancer-related and treatment-related fatigue,"Fatigue is a distressing and persistent symptom for gynecological cancer patients and survivors. Debilitating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is produced by both the disease and its treatment. Although awareness and study of CRF have increased in recent years, consistent assessment has not been a priority in routine medical practice. The pathophysiological mechanisms that induce CRF remain unclear, and effective pharmacological interventions have yet to be determined. Based on the literature and our own research results, this review focuses on recent advances in understanding the nature and causes of CRF and several promising treatment modalities. Given the prevalence and severity of CRF in the gynecological cancer patient population, it is extremely important to establish standardized methods of fatigue measurement and management in routine clinical oncology care. However, whether CRF has an underlying inflammatory cause remains hypothetical, and although the development of such interventions will provide patients with greater symptom control, there is currently no mechanism-driven symptom intervention in clinical use. Advancing transformational and clinical fatigue research will require anatomical pathways and well-designed clinical trials focused on the development of mechanism-driven interventions based on physiological-behavioral fatigue research, the application of guidelines for experimental designs, and the discovery of biomarkers that identify high-level individuals. risk for CRF. Confirmed patient-reported outcome measures are an important component of such clinical trials. Because many subscales, one-dimensional measurements, and multidimensional measurements are available, clinicians and researchers should consider individual circumstances, good clinical practice, and research goals as guidelines for selecting the most appropriate fatigue measurement tool. In addition, education about CRF should be provided to all patients and their caregivers, as accurate and age-appropriate information about conditions such as CRF can alleviate much of the stress and anxiety caused by poor communication about this distressing condition.",0,0,
302,Cardiac drug and psychotropic drug interactions: importance and recommendations,"Understanding cardiac drug interactions with concurrent psychotropic prescriptions is crucial for the psychiatrist as well as the practicing cardiologist and primary care physician. There has been an explosive use of new drugs in both psychiatry and cardiology without widespread knowledge of their potential interactions. The growing trend towards multi-pharmacy, the use of psychotropic drugs by cardiologists and primary care physicians caring for cardiac patients, and the growth of an aging population pose major challenges for the practitioner. Finally, models/paradigms are needed to predict potential drug interactions - eg Cytochrome p450 schema. This article describes a method for identifying, understanding, and coding interactions between psychotropic and cardiac drugs, and a systematic approach to update this important database and specific cardiac-psychotropic drug interactions. Specifically, this article 1) details interactions, 2) considers their level of clinical significance, 3) describes the potential mechanism(s) of interactions, and 4) offers recommendations to the clinician. Because most of the original clinical trials for both cardiac drugs and psychotropic drugs did not include studies comparing these two drug areas simultaneously, their interactions are often only known in the clinical arena with their combined use, using the patient as a ""guinea pig."" ,"" and via subsequent reporting.",0,0,
303,Cardiac rehabilitation and risk factor management after myocardial infarction. Clinical and economic evaluation,"The increasing scarcity of available and limited health resources and the increasing demand for health services have made it imperative to consider the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health services such as secondary prevention of heart disease. There is substantial evidence that modifying smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and lack of physical activity, alone or in combination, is effective in reducing the number of clinical events in secondary prevention of heart disease. Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both costs and consequences. Data generated in economic assessments of health services, such as risk factor modification for secondary prevention of heart disease, are useful in the development of clinical practice guidelines and health policies. While smoking cessation is the most cost-effective intervention for patients with documented heart disease, hyperlipidemia treatment and referral to cardiac rehabilitation are highly cost-effective per quality-adjusted life-year and relatively cost-effective per life-year saved. Risk factor management, delivered by a team of appropriately trained allied health professionals along with cardiovascular specialists and other physicians, is the cornerstone of optimal care in both primary and secondary prevention of heart disease.",0,0,
304,Cardiac Rehabilitation: Unraveling the Complexity of Referral and Current Delivery Models,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines recommend strategies to reduce risk factors for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes, but application to and completion of programs is insufficient to make this recommendation. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we describe the complexity of factors that influence the referral and delivery of evidence-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in the Australian context and provide direction for solutions that clinicians and policy makers should consider. The Ecological Approach is used as a framework for synthesizing evidence. The approach has 5 categories, the characteristics of which can act as barriers and facilitators to the promotion and adoption of health behaviors and include (a) interpersonal factors, (b) interpersonal factors, (c) institutional factors, (d) community networks, and (e) public policy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the context of strong evidence for efficacy, this review highlights systematic flaws in the implementation of CR, an important intervention that has been shown to improve patient outcomes and prevent cardiac events. Recommendations from this review include standardizing program delivery, improving data capture, using technological innovations and social networks to facilitate the delivery of information and support, and establishing a cohesive, coherent message through inter-agency collaboration in CR. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS: These pathways provide direction for potential solutions to improve CR uptake and secondary prevention.",0,0,

306,Caring for adults with developmental disabilities: implications of a continuing education course for primary care providers,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an interdisciplinary, guideline-based continuing education course on measures to care for adults with developmental disabilities (DD). DESIGN: A before and after study with a control group. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven primary care providers (doctors, registered nurses and nurses). INTERVENTION: Participants either only received reference material on primary care for persons with DD (control group) or attended a continuing education course on primary care care for persons with DD in addition to receiving reference material (intervention group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported 5 key measures regarding the care of adults with DD: frequency of using guidelines, frequency of performing periodic health checkups, frequency of evaluating patients presenting with behavioral changes, level of comfort in caring for adults with DD, and regarding adults with DD basic maintenance knowledge. RESULTS: Over time, the intervention group showed significant increases in 4 of the 5 key care measures compared to the control group: frequency of use of guidelines (P < .001), frequency of evaluation of behavior change by patients (P = .03), comfort level of care for persons with DD ( P = .01) and primary care information for adults with DD (P = .01).

307,Caring for the patient in menopause: a nurse practitioner view,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) and other treatment options for early postmenopausal women. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical studies, selected peer-reviewed literature, and current clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies on HT may not be directly applicable to healthy, early postmenopausal women suffering from hot flashes. HT is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. The benefits of HT in relieving menopausal symptoms are likely to outweigh the risks in this population. APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: The results of WHI reinforce the importance of individualized care based on the woman's medical history, medical needs, and desired outcomes. Nurse practitioners can help their patients put the final results into perspective. When HT is used, nurse practitioners should consider using lower doses and reassess the need for treatment annually.",0,0,
308,CD4 cell count and viral load monitoring in patients on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: a cost-effectiveness study.,"OBJECTIVE To examine the cost and cost-effectiveness of quarterly CD4 cell count and viral load monitoring in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN Cost effectiveness study. SETTINGS A randomized trial in a home-based ART program in Tororo, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS HIV-infected individuals who are members of AIDS Support Organization and have CD4 cell count <250 µ 10(6) cells/L or World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes calculated for the study period and projected beyond 15 years included costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness rates (ICER""; $ per DALY avoided). Cost inputs were empirical and other sources From the study clinical inputs obtained In the baseline, we assumed that point estimates reflect true differences, even if not significant. We performed univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyzes INTERVENTIONS Three monitoring strategies: clinical monitoring and viral load measurement (clinical/CD4/viral load) with quarterly CD4 cell counts; clinical monitoring and quarterly CD4 counts (clinical/CD4);"" and clinical monitoring only. RESULTS With intent to treat (ITT) outcomes per 100 people starting ART, we found that clinical/CD4 monitoring increased costs by $20,458 (£12,780, â€šâ€14,707) compared to clinical monitoring alone and prevented 117.3. DALY (ICER = $174 per DALY). Clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring adds $142,458 compared to clinical/CD4 monitoring and avoids 27.5 DALYs ($5181 per DALY). Superior ICER for clinical/CD4 monitoring is resistant to uncertainties in input values, and this strategy dominates (cheaper and more effective) when compared to clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring in a quarter of simulations. If clinical inputs are based on treated analysis starting at 90 days (after laboratory monitoring is initiated), other strategies dominate clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring. CONCLUSIONS Based on this trial, compared with clinical monitoring alone, routine CD4 cell count monitoring is much more cost-effective than adding routine viral load testing to the monitoring strategy and is more cost-effective than ART.",0,0,
309,Cervical cancer screening in adolescents: an evidence-based internet training program for practice development among advanced practice nurses.,"BACKGROUND: The literature reports that recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines vary widely in their application to clinical practice and in knowledge levels. Evidence-based screening guidelines for the prevention and early detection of cervical cancer offer healthcare providers an opportunity to improve practice patterns among female adolescents by reducing psychological distress as well as reducing healthcare costs and the morbidities associated with overscreening. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot intervention study was to determine the knowledge of advanced practice nurses (APNs) of a Web-based continuing education unit (CEU) program about current evidence-based recommendations for cervical cancer screening and their impact on their practice in practice. This article presents a process improvement project as an example of a way to disseminate updated evidence-based practice guidelines among busy healthcare providers. METHODS: This Web-based CEU program was developed, piloted, and evaluated specifically for APNs. The program addressed the level of knowledge about cervical cancer and its relationship to high-risk human papillomavirus. He also touched upon the new cervical cancer screening guidelines and their application to clinical practice. RESULTS: The results of the study showed that there are knowledge gaps among APNs about cervical cancer screening in adolescents. However, when a CEU educational intervention was provided, the knowledge levels of APNs increased and their self-reported clinical practice behavior changed according to the new cervical cancer screening guidelines. LINKING THE EVIDENCE TO PRACTICE: The provision of relevant and easily accessible up-to-date electronic content providing CEU accelerates the adoption of clinical practice guidelines, thereby reducing the potential for morbidity associated with excessive cervical cancer screening in adolescents and young women.",0,0,
310,Challenges and opportunities with the introduction of next-generation long-lived insecticidal networks for malaria control: a case study from Burkina Faso,"Background Decreases in malaria incidence in Africa are largely attributable to increases in malaria vector control activities"", predominantly the use of long-lived insecticidal nets (LLINs). Insecticide resistance affects an increasing number of malaria-endemic countries and threatens their effectiveness. This There is a growing urgency for the implementation of alternative tools to control resistant populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential challenges and opportunities to accelerate access to next-generation LLINs in Burkina Faso, a country with high levels of virus. Insecticide resistance Methods Selection of interviewees, data an analytical framework was used to guide collection and analysis Semi-structured interviews with key information providers were conducted in Burkina Faso in April 2014 Interviews were conducted in French and English, audio recorded, transcribed and entered into NVivo 10 for data management and analysis. coded according to framework themes and d It is then analyzed to provide a definition of key points and to explain patterns in the data. Conclusions Interviewees reported that the policy architecture in Burkina Faso is characterized by a strong framework of actors that contribute to policy-making and strong national research capacity that indirectly contributes to national policy change through collaboration with internationally-led research. Financing significantly impacts the potential adoption, availability, and affordability of next-generation LLINs. This gives significant leverage to the international donors funding vector control. National decisions over which LLINs will be procured were limited to quantity and delivery dates; ""The potential to combat pesticide resistance was not part of the decision-making process. Also, at the time of the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not have guidance on where and when next-generation LLINs can have a positive impact on malaria transmission, which means their adoption, This study shows that access to next-generation LLINs is severely compromised by the lack of global guidance.Burkina Faso, where WHO recommendations are adopted relatively quickly, with clear WHO advice and adequate funding, next-generation LLN It will be the key to speed up access to .",0,0,
311,"Interchangeability, trust, common sense, and validation: comprehensive suicide risk assessment","OBJECTIVE: The authors, in collaboration with NSW Health, have recently developed a comprehensive suicide risk assessment framework. This article explains the key concepts in the assessment of suicide risk by mental health professionals. METHODS: A framework was established to conduct a comprehensive suicide risk assessment from the literature, event analysis, and clinical experience. The framework went through a consultation process involving clinicians in NSW area mental health services. The aim was to provide clinicians with a standardized conceptual map for the assessment of suicide risk. A MEDLINE search was conducted for publications on 'suicide' and 'suicide risk assessment' from 1980 to 2002. Recommendations from on-call case studies conducted at a mental health service in the NSW region during 1999-2002 were reviewed. Lessons learned from the visit to a coroner's relatives support group for people mourning suicide also informed the development of guidelines. RESULTS: A framework has been proposed for the assessment of suicide risk. The framework encourages a reflective style of practice, encouraging clinicians to consider their assessments and limitations. Risk assessment is always done as part of a full clinical assessment and assessment of the person's current predicament and psychosocio-cultural context. The concepts of mutability, evaluation confidence, common sense, and the importance of validation are included in the framework. CONCLUSIONS: A framework can guide mental health clinicians in assessing and documenting suicide risk. The assessment of suicide risk can establish a suicide risk rating for which minimum standards of care can be mandated.",0,0,
312,Changes and challenges: managing ADHD in a fast-paced world,"OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) negatively affects the lives of both children and adults. Undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can have serious lifelong consequences. Research has identified diagnostic clues, neurotransmitter pathways, and psychiatric comorbidities associated with ADHD, as well as effective pharmacological, behavioral, and psychosocial interventions. Stimulant agents have been the foundation of ADHD treatment for over 50 years. The availability of new extended-release (XR or ER) and longer-acting (LA) formulations and new agents allows for wider and more personalized treatment options. The side effects of stimulants are usually mild, short-lived, and responsive to adjustments in dosage or timing. Outcomes in ADHD treatment can be improved through the use of clear treatment guidelines and tools to help clinicians implement them efficiently and effectively. The Texas Children's Drug Algorithm Project (CMAP) provides an algorithm-based system of treatment decisions that is evidence-based and easy to implement. OBJECTIVE: (1) To review the psychological components of attention, the neurotransmitter pathways associated with ADHD, and the array of therapeutic options for ADHD, with emphasis on the latest entries in therapeutic equipment; (2) discuss rare psychiatric disorders and cardiovascular side effects associated with stimulants; (3) review liability for abuse, comorbidities, and suggested approaches to these issues; and (4) review the development and use of CMAP and provide resources for its application in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiology of ADHD is associated with dysfunction of fronto-subcortical networks and dysregulation of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and nicotinic neurotransmitter systems. Additional effects of multiple genes and environmental influences contribute to the clinical picture. Treatment with stimulants and non-stimulants has proven effective in different subgroups, most likely with the efficacy of specific agents related to the primary neurotransmitter involved. The availability of XR, ER, LA, and transdermal stimulant formulations, as well as alternative non-stimulant agents, offer new options for pharmacotherapy of ADHD. Major concerns about the abuse liability of stimulants have been addressed by the availability of ER formulations that reduce the potentiating effects associated with short-acting preparations. Medication outcomes in ADHD can be improved with the use of evidence-based algorithms such as CMAP. The keys to success are adequate initial assessment and diagnosis, use of sustained-release products, adequate dose titration, and use of clinical rating scales with feedback from caregivers and teachers. Optimal treatment results can be achieved with appropriate pharmacotherapy along with psychosocial interventions.",0,0,
313,"Changes in insurance physicians' attitudes, self-efficacy, intentions, and knowledge and skills regarding depression guidelines following an implementation strategy","INTRODUCTION: An implementation strategy to improve policy adherence by insurance physicians (IPs) was developed and investigated in a randomized controlled trial. This implementation strategy included a well-rounded training program in applying guidelines for depression to a group of IPs. In this study, we report the effect of practice strategy on physicians' attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy, and knowledge and skills as behavioral determinants of guideline compliance. Any link between these self-reported behavioral markers and levels of adherence to the guideline was also identified. METHODS: Immediately before and 3 months after the implementation of the omnidirectional training, a questionnaire designed to measure behavioral determinants based on the ASE (attitude, social norm, self-efficacy) model was completed with intervention (n = 21) and control group (n = 19). The items of the questionnaire were grouped to form the scales of the ASE determinants. Internal consistency of the scales was calculated using Cronbach's alphas. Differences between groups regarding changes in ASE determinants and the relationship of these changes to improvements in guideline compliance were analyzed using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the scales of AFE predictors proved to be sufficiently reliable, with Cronbach's alphas of at least 0.70. At follow-up after 3 months, IPs given the implementation strategy showed significant improvement over control IPs for all ASE determinants investigated. Changes in knowledge and skills were only weakly associated with improvements in guideline adherence. CONCLUSION: The practice strategy developed for insurance physicians can increase their attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy, knowledge and skills while applying depression guidelines. These changes in behavioral determinants may indicate positive changes in the behavior of IPs towards the use of depression guidelines. However, only changes in knowledge and skills related to the use of the guidelines were associated with improvements in the actual performance of the IPs when applying the guidelines.",0,0,
314,Changes in lifestyle habits after consulting nurse practitioners: 1-year results of the Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle study.,"OBJECTIVES: The Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle (GOAL) study primarily aims to prevent weight gain in nurse practitioners (NP) guided by a standard computer software program. Understanding the effects on lifestyle habits is important, as positive changes in physical activity (PA) and diet can improve health independent of weight (loss). We examined the 1-year effects of NP lifestyle counseling on PA and diet compared with GP usual care (GP-UC). DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Eleven general practice locations in the Netherlands. SUBJECTS: A total of 341 TARGET participants, at baseline and 1 year later, with overweight or obesity and hypertension or dyslipidemia, or both, who completed the FFQ and Short Questionnaire to Evaluate Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH). RESULTS: After 1 year, the NP group spent 33 minutes more per week walking compared to the GP-UC group who spent -5 minutes per week walking (P = 0.05). There was no significant difference between the NP and GP-UC groups in the percentage of people who followed the PA guidelines. Food intake changed positively in both groups and participants followed dietary guidelines more frequently, but there was no overall difference between the NP and GP-UC groups. RESULTS: No intervention effects on PA and diet occurred in the NP group, except for an increase in walking (based on self-reported data). Positive changes in food intake were seen in both groups.",0,0,
315,Changes in nurse practitioners' knowledge and behavior after a brief education on healthy eating and combined activity (HEAT) guidelines,"INTRODUCTION: Primary care providers, especially pediatric nurses, are an integral force in tackling the obesity epidemic among youth. However, most nurse practitioners report low proficiency in their ability to adequately prevent and treat pediatric overweight. In response, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) developed the evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Healthy Eating and Combined Activity (HEAT) (CPG) to improve provider behavior and effectiveness. METHOD: Thirty-five nurse practitioners attending the NAPNAP Annual Conference participated in an intensive 4-hour HEAT CPG training session. Pre- and post-training data were collected on provider knowledge, practice behaviors, and barriers to overweight prevention among youth. RESULTS: Post-training outcomes, (a) in practitioner knowledge (assessment of patient growth, family history, psychosocial functioning, nutrition, and physical activity); (b) practitioners' intent to improve behavior (i.e., use behavior change and counseling for patient and family behavior change) );"" and (c) practitioners' report of increased confidence in its ability to address barriers. CONCLUSION: Study findings demonstrate preliminary support for HEAT CPG as an effective tool aimed at helping providers improve patients' ability to maintain a healthy weight. Future research is needed to confirm the effects of HEAT CPG on long-term improvements in care.",0,0,
316,Changes in nursing home residents during an innovation based on gerotranscendence theory,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate how residents are affected when an intervention based on gerotranscendence theory and theory-derived guidelines is introduced in a nursing home. BACKGROUND: The idea that communication is essential in staff-calm interaction is widely accepted, both in theory and in practice, as is the idea that communicative behavior influences patient outcomes. No studies have yet focused on whether guides derived from the gerotranscendence theory of residents are affected by staff use. DESIGN: The research was exploratory in nature and used a qualitative approach. METHODS: Data were collected through interviews with residents and participant observations""; qualitative content analysis was conducted. SAMPLE SIZE: six residents. RESULTS: The research shows that many residents review and think about their lives and this direction has changed over the course of the study. Some residents' descriptions of their situation, revealed that some changes had occurred in the social life of the ward. These changes may have an effect on the intervention. this includes a holistic view that assists residents in their aging processes. The use of guidelines derived from gerotranscendence theory can help nurses promote positive aging and create a way to treat residents in a more individual way.",0,0,

319,"Changing doctors' behavior: a training program to popularize a new clinical pathway for hospital management of hip fractures in elderly patients in the Lazio Region, Italy","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Concerns about patient safety have fueled interest in approaches to improve physician performance, but the dissemination of clinical guidelines and traditional continuing medical education has often failed. This study investigated the effects of an experience-based education program on the quality of care for patients with hip fractures in Lazio, Italy. METHODS: Five hospitals participated. The work consisted of the development of a clinical pathway, a preparatory phase, and the educational intervention itself; this consisted of follow-up a course, reflection on practice, and audits guided by monthly audits and analysis of patient charts. Data on the quality of care of patients with hip fractures were collected from the routine information system for the pre-intervention and post-intervention period. RESULTS: A significant increase in the proportion of patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of admission (from 7% in 2006 to 26.4% in 2007) and a significant reduction in the average length of hospital stay (from 18.8 to 16.4 days) ) happened. . Some process indicators of quality of care were high after intervention, but non-recommended practices were still routinely used (for example, urinary catheterization in 72.2% of patients). There were differences in changes when hospitals were compared. CONCLUSION: An educational intervention that combined the dissemination of a clinical pathway with external supervision to reflect on practice was effective in promoting changes in physicians' behavior. The persistence of non-recommended practices and differences between hospitals suggest that multiple factors influence performance and the effectiveness of interventions.",0,0,
320,Modifying human behavior to prevent disease: the importance of targeting automated processes.,"Much of the global burden of disease is associated with behaviors (overeating, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity) that people regard as harmful to health and that persist even with undesirable consequences. To date, interventions to change such behavior have greatly encouraged people to reflect on their behavior. These approaches are often ineffective; This is in line with the observation that most human behavior is automatic, signaled by environmental stimuli, and results in actions largely unaccompanied by conscious reflection. We suggest that interventions targeting these automatic behavioral bases may be more effective. We discuss specific interventions and suggest ways to determine if and how interventions targeting automated processes can improve global efforts to prevent disease.",0,1,
321,Shifting minds: Limited rationality and heuristic processes in exercise-related judgments and choices.,"Theories currently used to understand, predict, and promote physical activity and exercise represent information-processing patterns of the mind. A basic assumption that supports these theories is that human judgment and decision-making are rational. Therefore, interventions derived from these models are intended to improve ""data input"" (for example, to provide complete, accurate and convincing information about health benefits) with the expectation that rational evaluation of these data will result in the desired behavioral ""output"". Given the modest effectiveness of interventions based on these models, we designed 2 experiments that tested the validity of the rationality assumption, focusing specifically on exercise-related judgments and decisions. In Experiment 1, the exercise decisions were changed by shifting them to an arbitrary anchor whose existence should have nothing to do with those judgments. In Experiment 2, the preference between a target training session and an alternative was increased only by the addition of a third ""bait"" exercise option. Together, these experiments demonstrate that important motivational variables, including perceived desirability of exercise, emotional attitude, intention, emotional predictions, and exercise choices can be manipulated in a predictable direction without providing any new relevant information, but by targeting only specific, good situations. characterized heuristics. These data thus provide evidence that the ""limited"" nature of human rationality is also manifested in judgment and decision exercises. Researchers and exercise practitioners should consider combining heuristics in dual-process theoretical models of physical activity and exercise behavior.

322,Changing doctor behavior to improve disease prevention,"Doctors are often unable to provide nationally recommended preventive services for their patients. Taking this into account, we reviewed selected literature on changing physician behavior using the organizational structure of the ""readiness for change"" transtheoretical model. This model proposes that behavior develops through the stages of precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, initiation, and sustaining change. Traditional continuing medical education can influence knowledge and beliefs, but rarely results in behavior change. However, motivational strategies such as practice feedback reports and influential peers can encourage stage change. Successful interventions for physicians preparing for change often use an office system approach that targets not only physicians but also office workers and patients. We describe the strategies used by primary care physicians in a statewide randomized controlled trial to improve cancer prevention counseling and early detection, showing how readiness to change the model can guide the design and delivery of interventions. Partners for Prevention's multi-stage interventions include support from a medical responsibility bearer, a motivational videotape, a task-related office guide, graphical flowcharts, patient activation forms, practice feedback reports, a designated prevention coordinator at each practice, and regular phone calls and office is located. visits by project staff.",0,0,
323,Changing doctor behavior: what does it do?,"OBJECTIVES: There are a variety of interventions for guideline implementation in clinical practice, but the effects of these interventions are often unclear. We conducted a systematic review to identify effective methods of applying clinical research findings and clinical guidelines to change physician practice patterns in surgery and general practice. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of reviews. METHODS: We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed) for systematic reviews published in English evaluating the effectiveness of different administration methods. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility for inclusion and methodological quality and extracted relevant data. RESULTS: Fourteen reviews were identified covering a wide range of interventions. Intervention methods used include: supervision and feedback, computerized decision support systems, continuing medical education, financial incentives, local opinion leaders, marketing, passive dissemination of information, patient-mediated interventions, reminders, and multifaceted interventions. Active approaches, such as academic elaboration, have had greater effects than traditional passive approaches. According to the findings of the 3 reviews, 71% of the studies included in these reviews showed positive changes in physician behavior when exposed to active education methods and multifaceted interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Active forms of continuing medical education and multifaceted interventions were found to be the most effective methods for applying guidelines to general practice. In addition, active approaches to modifying physician performance have been shown to improve practice to a greater extent than traditional passive methods. More primary research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in a surgical setting.",0,1,

The behavior of 165 doctors in 2 settings (suburb and city) was examined. After collecting baseline clinical data, including systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a series of interventions, including academic details, were performed. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 10.4% (P = .001) in suburban patients with cardiovascular disease in the intervention group and 10.5% in the enhanced intervention group (P = .001). Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 1.11% (P = .357) in the intervention group and 5.13% in the enhanced intervention group (P < .001). In urban hypertensive patients, systolic blood pressure was decreased by 5.03% (P = 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was decreased by 7.01% (P < 0.001). When urban and suburban data were combined, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 9.32% (P < .001) and systolic blood pressure decreased 4.00% (P < .001).

Systematic reviews and other relevant reviews were considered, as well as individual qualitative and quantitative research studies. Four main databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed literature published in the last 10 years. Papers prior to this period were included in the review if the study was considered stimulating in terms of its contribution to the self-management knowledge base in the context of interest. The following terms are used as keywords and linked using Boolean operators: self-care, self-management, chronic illness, chronic illness, patient education as a subject, patient-centered care, health behavior, low back pain, and musculoskeletal disorders. As the focus of the review was working-age people, the limits applied included the English language and adults aged 15-64. Relevant gray literature and references from key authors in the field were also consulted. We did not formally assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Identified peer-reviewed studies were then conceptually examined for components of intervention that are tightly linked to the involvement of self-management and chronic conditions, particularly MSDs, and otherwise excluded.

In the last few years, this field has been increasingly incorporated into healthcare settings to promote healthier lifestyles. Typically, monetary incentives are given to participants when a target behavior or goal is objectively verified. In this section, we describe this evidence-based treatment, often referred to as contingency management. This section is structured as four sections. The ""Background"" section reviews the historical background of incentive-based interventions in substance abuse treatment. The section ""Application of Incentive-Based Intervention to Drug Targets"" describes the application of these interventions to other drug targets such as vaccination, medical screenings, diabetes monitoring, physical activity, and weight loss programs. The section ""Key Elements and Concepts of Incentive-Based Interventions"" explains the key concepts and elements embedded in effective incentive-based interventions, and the final section discusses issues related to the implementation and dissemination of incentive programs.

328,Chapter: Escape from Cognitiveism: Exercise as a hedonic experience.,"Establishing social relevance should be a strategic goal for exercise psychology. But progress towards this goal has been slower than anyone in this field would like. In this section, we argued that the inability to provide intervention methods that can reliably and significantly increase physical activity level may be due in part to an overly narrow meta-theoretical perspective. We have shown that all the major theories in fashion in exercise psychology in the past decades are derivatives of the same (cognitive) meta-theoretical framework. Therefore, they all exhibit a very important limitation, namely, the relative disregard for the motivational features of affective constructs such as basic affect, moods, and emotions. Research over the past 15 years has shown that the old adage ""exercise makes people feel better"" is false. Therefore, the main purpose of this chapter was to highlight the urgent need of the field of exercise psychology for the transition to the postcognitivist era.

329,Characteristics of poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes patients in Swiss primary care,"BACKGROUND: Although various treatment guidelines are available for patients with type 2 diabetes, most patients do not meet the recommended goals. We aimed to characterize patients with Type 2 diabetes who missed HbA1c treatment targets from Swiss primary care and to reveal the factors associated with poorly controlled HbA1c level. METHODS: The cross-sectional study is included in the cluster randomized controlled Chronic Care for Diabetes study. Type 2 diabetes patients with at least one HbA1c measurement >/= 7.0% in the past year were recruited from Swiss primary health care services. Data evaluation included diabetes-specific and general clinical measures, treatment factors, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: 326 Type 2 diabetes patients from 30 primary health care institutions with a mean age of 67.1 +/- 10.6 years participated in the study. The HbA1c findings of the patients were 7.7% +/- 1.3, systolic blood pressure was 139.1 +/- 17.6 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure was 80.9 +/- 10.5 mmHg, and low-density lipoprotein was 2.7 +/- 1.1. 93.3% of patients suffered from at least one comorbidity and were treated with 4.8 +/- 2.1 different drugs. No determinant factor was significantly associated with HbA1c in the multiple analysis, but a significant clustering effect of GPs on HbA1c could be found. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample of patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes, no ""bullet points"" could be demonstrated that could easily be remedied by some type of intervention. There appears to be a complex interaction between diabetes control, comorbidities, GP treatment, and patients' health behaviors, especially in this subgroup of diabetes patients, who will most benefit from appropriate interventions to improve diabetes control. So far this interaction has only been poorly described and understood.",0,0,

The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of successfully applied telemedical applications. Methods An extensive telemedicine literature review was conducted to identify relevant articles. After a defined selection process, a small number of papers were identified describing the characteristics of successfully implemented telemedical applications. These articles were analyzed qualitatively based on central procedures from the Grounded Theory (GT), including condensation and categorization. The analysis resulted in a description of the features found to be important for the successful practice of telemedicine. Later, these features are discussed in the light of Science and Technology studies (STS) and the concept of 'social negotiation'. Results The routine practice of telemedicine is typically characterized by the following six features: 1) local service delivery issues are clearly articulated, 2) telemedicine is seen as a benefit, 3) telemedicine is seen as a solution to political and medical problems. problems, 4) there was cooperation between promoters and users, 5) organizational and technological arrangements issues were discussed, and 6) future operation of the service was evaluated. Conclusion Our findings support research that argues that technologies are not fixed assets that move from invention to diffusion and routine use. Rather, it is the interaction between technical and social factors that produces a particular outcome. The success of a technology depends on how this interaction is managed during the implementation process.",0,0,
331,Child survival in the Third World: a functional analysis of oral rehydration therapy promotion campaigns.,"PIP: Behavior analysts conducted a functional analysis of different intervention strategies used in 14 oral rehydration therapy (ORT) campaigns in 10 developing countries. Intervention researchers manipulated antecedents, behaviors, and/or outcomes to improve diarrhea management. Strategies used radio announcements, posters and pamphlets to promote behavior change. Only 2 campaigns (Thailand and Egypt) limited their interventions to these premises. Only 3 programs manipulated premises, behavior, and consequences. The 1983 campaign in Bangladesh included schooling and home visits to siblings as part of skills training and provided incentives (US$30) to trainers as a result. A 1985 project in The Gambia used health workers to teach ORT to mothers at home and handed out happy baby lottery prizes (rice, candy and soap). The skills training component of the 1984 campaign in Honduras included one-on-one training. A radio course on breastfeeding, school education for siblings, and an illustrated health care guide. The results were games and prizes on radio show calls, free calendars, key chains, t-shirts and a trip to Tegucigalpa. The only program limited to the skills training component was the 1976 campaign in South India. The training included the training of nurses to train mothers on diarrhea management. One hurdle in all campaigns was that ORT did not outwardly improve diarrhea and vomiting. Campaigns with a skills training component were more effective than those without. Behavior analysts can contribute to ORT campaigns by developing simple and effective training programs and by developing economical and effective mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of such campaigns.",0,0,

333,Childhood Obesity Screening and Treatment Practices of Child Health Professionals,"In this study, childhood obesity screening and treatment practices of physicians were evaluated. A 26-question survey was delivered to pediatric providers across Louisiana in person or by mail, email, or fax. Fifty-seven providers completed the survey, the majority in primary care clinics. Five providers met at least four of the seven clinical guidelines, but no provider met all the guidelines. 88% of providers screened for obesity, while 7% met guidelines for referring obesity patients to weight management services. Six providers presented interventions that included all recommended components (i.e. diet, physical activity, and behavioral counseling). An intervention met intensity guidelines (ie >25 hours for at least six months). Barriers to service delivery included lack of reimbursement and poor family adjustment. In order to increase the delivery of health services for children with obesity, solutions to overcome treatment barriers should be determined.",0,0,
334,Childhood tonsillectomy: who is referred and what treatment options are available? Key findings from the Children's Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy Study (NESSTAC) in Northern England and Scotland,"Background: Tonsillectomy is frequently performed, but there are variations in tonsillectomy rates. Clinicians use guidelines, but the complex psychosocial effects on childhood tonsillectomy include anecdotal evidence of parental enthusiasm. Studies show that engaging in preferred treatment improves outcome. Despite the enthusiasm for offering and seeking tonsil surgery, there is little evidence of effectiveness. This resulted in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy in children with recurrent sore throat. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of children enrolled in a randomized study with those enrolled in a parallel, nonrandomized study, and to identify trends in patient preferences for referral and treatment. DESIGN: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial with a parallel non-randomized preference study comparing surgery to medical treatment in children aged 4-15 years with recurrent sore throat referred to five secondary otolaryngology departments in the north or west center of England Scotland . RESULTS: The centers evaluated 1546 children"";"" 21% were ineligible for tonsillectomy. Among older children (8-15 years), girls were significantly more likely to be referred to secondary health care. Of 1015 eligible children, 268 (28.2%) agreed to be randomized, while 461 (45.4%) accepted a parallel, nonrandomized preference trial and made a strong preference for tonsillectomy. Participants who reported hindered progress in school or had more persistent sore throat experiences were more likely to seek tonsillectomy. Referred boys were more likely than girls to opt for medical treatment. Socio-economic data showed no effect. CONCLUSION: Tonsillectomy preference reflects educational impact and recent experience rather than age or socio-economic status.",0,0,
335,Kids in taxis: an opportunity for pediatricians and ER doctors to save lives?,"PURPOSE: Child restraints (infant seats, child restraints and seat belts) are effective in reducing the risk of injury"";"" however, a pattern remains of parental non-use or misuse of safety seats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of knowledge and compliance of parents regarding children admitted to emergency care regarding the National Highway and Traffic Association's safety seat guidelines in private vehicles and taxis. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two caregivers of children (age range, 2 weeks to 19 years) presenting for care to the pediatric emergency department of a city university hospital were reached to fill out an interviewer-administered questionnaire, and 225 participated. The questionnaire included questions of knowledge, attitude and behavior about protective equipment for children of various ages. RESULTS: 11 (47.8%) of 23 children 1 year old or younger were reported to use a baby seat frequently or always while getting into a private car, while 8 (22.2%) of 36 children 1 year old or younger were using a baby seat. He reported that he used it while in the baby seat. taxis (P < 0.05). It was reported that 17 (85%) of 20 children older than 8 years of age used seat belts frequently or always in private cars, whereas 10 (41.7%) of 24 children were in taxis (P < 0.01). Fifty-four (99.3%) of the 155 subjects knew the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recommended position for a safety seat for their children. Most parents believed in the effectiveness of child safety seats in preventing vehicle injuries and reported that they would be more likely to use safety devices if they were informed about their use in the emergency room. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained from this study show that the use of safety seats in taxis is lower than in private cars, and this is due to the difficulty of transporting these seats to and from a taxi, rather than financial concerns or lack of knowledge about their effectiveness. Strategies should be sought to increase the availability of child safety devices in taxis. Besides the emergency room, the pediatrician's office or clinic can be a place for educational intervention for parents and caregivers about child passenger safety.",0,0,

337,Children's Cognitive Performance and Selective Attention after Recent Societal Violence,"Research has shown robust associations between community violence and psychopathology, but relatively little is known about how community violence can affect cognitive performance and attention. Using a quasi-experimental fixed effects design, this study estimates the effects of police-reported community violence on the performance of 359 urban children on a computerized neuropsychological task. Living near a recent violent crime showed faster but marginally less accurate task performance for the entire sample, evolutionarily adaptive ""vigilant"" attention patterns (i.e., less attention to positive stimuli, more attention to negative stimuli) for children who reported low attention) predicted. Trait anxiety and potentially maladaptive “avoidant” attention patterns for children with high levels of anxiety. These results suggest that community violence may directly affect children's cognitive performance and may also have differential (and potentially orthogonal) effects on distraction depending on children's biobehavioral risk levels. Implications for mental health and sociological research are discussed.",0,0,
338,Chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Psychostimulants are the first-line treatment for pediatric and adolescent ADHD/HD. Evidence shows that up to 30% of prescribed stimulant drugs do not show clinically relevant results. In addition, many children and adolescents experience the side effects of these drugs. As a result, parents are seeking alternative interventions for their children. Complementary and alternative medicine treatments for behavioral disorders such as ADHD/HD are on the rise, with 68% of parents seeking help from alternative practitioners, including chiropractors. OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to answer the question of whether chiropractic care can reduce symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity for pediatric and adolescent ADHD/HD. METHODS: Electronic databases (Cochrane CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Index to Chiropractic Literature) searched up to July 2009 for English language studies for chiropractic care . and AD/HD. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to selected studies. All randomized controlled trials were evaluated using the Jadad score and a checklist developed from the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. RESULTS: The search yielded 58 citations, 22 of which were intervention studies. Of these, only three studies were identified for the pediatric and adolescent AD/HD cohorts. Methodological quality was poor and none of the studies were eligible to use inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to date to evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. Claims that chiropractic care improves pediatric and adolescent AD/HD are supported by only low levels of scientific evidence. In terms of pediatric and adolescent health, more rigorous scientific research is needed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment if chiropractic care for ADHD/HD is to continue. RCTs of adequate size using clinically relevant outcomes and standardized measures are needed to examine the efficacy of chiropractic care with treatment-free/placebo control or standard care (pharmacological and psychosocial care) to determine whether chiropractic care is an effective alternative intervention for pediatric and adolescent.

339,Choosing wisely in headache medicine: The American Headache Association's list of five things doctors and patients should question,"To draw attention to the tests and procedures associated with low-value care in headache medicine, the American Headache Society (AHS) has joined the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choose Wise initiative. The AHS president has appointed a temporary ""Choose Wisely"" task force of the AHS. The committee surveyed AHS members to develop a candidate ingredient list for the AHS ""Top 5"" list of low-value care in headache medicine. After going through a literature review and consensus process, a final five-item list was selected. Draft recommendations have gone through several review rounds and an external review process. The AHS Board of Directors has approved the final list of ""Five Things"". The five recommendations, approved by the AHS Board of Directors, are: (1) do not perform neuroimaging studies in patients with stable headaches who meet criteria for migraine; (2) do not perform computed tomography imaging for headache when magnetic resonance imaging is performed. can be used except in emergencies; (3) does not recommend surgical inactivation of migraine trigger points outside of clinical research; (4) does not prescribe opioid or butalbital-containing medications as first-line therapy for recurrent headache disorders;"" and (5) does not recommend prolonged or frequent use of over-the-counter pain medications for headaches.

340,Choosing wisely: The American College of Rheumatology's list of top 5 things doctors and patients should question,"OBJECTIVE: We tried to create a list of 5 tests, treatments or services that are commonly used in rheumatology practice and whose necessity or value should be questioned and discussed by doctors and patients. METHODS: We used a multi-step process combining consensus methodology and literature reviews to arrive at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Top 5 list. Rheumatologists from various practice environments produced substances using the Delphi method. Substances with high content agreement and perceived high prevalence progressed to a survey of ACR members who make up >90% of the US rheumatology workforce. To increase the response rate, a nested random sample of 390 rheumatologists received more intensive survey follow-up. The samples were combined and weighting processes were applied to ensure generalizability. Items with high ratings were subjected to a literature review. Final items were then selected and formulated by the task force. RESULTS: One hundred and five unique items were suggested during Delphi tours and narrowed down to 22 items. A total of 1,052 rheumatologists (17% of those contacted) participated in the member-wide survey, compared with 33% of those in the nested random sample"";"" responder characteristics were similar in both samples. Based on survey results and available scientific evidence, 5 items (related to antinuclear antibodies, Lyme disease, magnetic resonance imaging, bone absorptiometry, and biological therapy for rheumatoid arthritis) were selected for inclusion. CONCLUSION: The ACR Top 5 list aims to stimulate debate among physicians and patients about health practices in rheumatology whose use should be questioned, and to assist rheumatologists in providing high-value care.",0,0,
341,Choosing wisely: American Society of Radiation Oncology's top 5 list,"OBJECTIVE: To highlight 5 interventions patients should question as part of the Choose Wisely campaign. This initiative, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, encourages conversations between doctors and patients about treatments and tests that could be overused, unnecessary, or potentially harmful. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Potential items were initially compiled using an online questionnaire. These were then evaluated and corrected by a working group representing the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Councils for Clinical Affairs and Quality, Health Policy, and Government Relationships. A literature review was conducted to support the recommendation and explanation and to provide references for each item. A final list of 5 items was then selected by the ASTRO Board of Directors. CONCLUSIONS: ASTRO's 5 recommendations for the Choose Wise campaign are: (1) In women >/=50 years of age with early-stage invasive breast cancer, do not unthinkingly initiate whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast-conservation treatment programs""; (2) active do not initiate low-risk prostate cancer treatment without discussing surveillance (3) do not routinely use extended fractionation schemes (>10 fractions) for palliation of bone metastases (4) do not routinely recommend proton beam therapy for prostate cancer outside of a prospective clinical trial or enrollment; and (5) do not routinely use intensity modulated radiation therapy to deliver whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast shielding therapy CONCLUSIONS: The ASTRO list for the Choose Wise campaign highlights radiation oncology interventions that should be discussed among physicians and patients before initiating treatment. better quality and less costly maintenance Provides opportunities for flourishing.",0,0,
342,The chronic care model and shared care in diabetes: a randomized trial of an electronic decision support system.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of a specialist telemedicine intervention to improve diabetes care using the chronic care model (CCM). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS As part of CCM, 97 primary care physicians at 6 primary care practices in Rochester, MN referred 639 patients to onsite diabetes educators between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003. At initial referral, physicians were centrally randomized to receive a telemedicine intervention (evidence-based messages on expert advice and drug management for cardiovascular risk) or no intervention, blinding outcome evaluators and data analysts to group assignments. After each subsequent clinical encounter, endocrinologists reviewed a summary from the patient's electronic medical records and provided management advice and supporting evidence to the intervention physicians via email. Control physicians received periodic e-mails with general information on cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Outcomes included diabetes care processes (completion of diabetes testing), outcomes (metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, estimated risk of coronary artery disease), and patient costs (payer perspective). RESULTS During intervention, 951 (70%) of 1361 endocrinology reviews identified performance gaps and resulted in a message; primary care physicians reported that 49% of the messages were used in patient care. With a mean follow-up of 21 months, the intervention did not significantly improve metabolic outcomes or reduce the estimated risk of coronary artery disease (adjusted mean difference, -1%; 95% CI, -19% 17%) compared with control.

343,Chronic illness health risk behaviors among people with mental illness,"OBJECTIVE: In people with mental illness, modifiable health risk behaviors contribute significantly to increased chronic disease morbidity and mortality. This study examined the prevalence of such behavior and the interest in changing it among community mental health service clients in Australia. METHOD: A telephone interview was conducted with Australian community mental health service clients. Participants reported engaging in four health risk behaviors: tobacco smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Participants were classified as at risk according to Australian national guidelines. At-risk participants were asked if they considered improving their health-risk behavior in the next month. The relationship between psychiatric diagnosis and risk, and the interest in improving health-risk behaviors were examined. RESULTS: The highest risk prevalence is inadequate vegetable consumption (78.3%), followed by insufficient fruit consumption (60%), smoking (50.7%), physical inactivity (46.8%), short-term alcohol risk (40%). ,3) and chronic alcohol. risk (35.3%). Most at-risk participants were considering improving their health-risk behaviors for smoking, physical inactivity, and insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables (65.1%, 71.1%, and 53.3%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic factors, no risk-related diagnostic categories were found for any behavior. Those diagnosed with depression were more likely to be interested in quitting smoking and increasing physical activity. RESULTS: A high prevalence of risky behaviors for chronic disease health was identified, with many participants expressing an interest in improving these behaviors, regardless of diagnosis. Such findings strengthen recommendations for routine provision of preventive care by mental health clinicians for clients' chronic disease risks.

344,Chronic inflammatory bowel disease competency network,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) occur intermittently, mostly chronic diseases affect young people aged 20-30 years and affect their quality of life and socioeconomic productivity. The factors that trigger the development of IBD are not fully understood: besides environmental factors, there is clear evidence of additional genetic factors that influence disease risk and the pattern of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. Pathophysiological discoveries are leading to new therapeutic opportunities being conducted in large clinical trials with the main participation of the competency network IBD. The extensive network of university and non-university hospitals and laboratories, vertical collaboration with the self-help organization DCCV and GPs across the country provides the opportunity to simultaneously define diseases from the point of view of scientist and physician. The competency network IBD therefore provides the basis for standardized integration of patient information, the development of guidelines, and the establishment of a quality management system, thus leading to improved scientific and clinical research.",0,0,
345,Smoking Prevalence Among Adults with HIV Compared to the General Adult Population in the United States,"Background: The adverse health effects of smoking and HIV infection are synergistic. Objective: To compare the current prevalence of smoking and smoking cessation among adults with HIV receiving medical care and adults in the general population. Design: Nationally representative cross-sectional studies. Setting: United States. Patients: 4217 adults with HIV who participated in the Medical Monitoring Project and 27,731 US adults who participated in the National Health Interview Survey in 2009. Measures: The baseline exposure was smoking. Outcomes were weighted for smoking prevalence and quit rate (former smokers vs current and current smokers combined). Results: Of the estimated 419 945 adults with HIV receiving medical care, 42.4% (95% CI, 39.7%) to 45.1% were current smokers, 20.3% (CI, 18.6% to 18.6%) 22.1% were previous smokers and 37.3% (CI, 34.9% to 39.6%) had never smoked. Compared with the US adult population, where an estimated 20.6% of adults smoked in 2009, adults with HIV were almost twice as likely to smoke (adjusted prevalence difference, 17.0 percentage points [CI, 14.0 to 20 percent, 1 point]), but less likely to quit (quit rate, 51.7% vs. 32.4%). Among adults with HIV, factors independently associated with a higher prevalence of smoking include advanced age, non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black race, lower education level, poverty, homelessness, incarceration, substance use, excessive alcohol use, depression, and successful was not to be. suppressed HIV viral load. Limitation: Cross-sectional design with some limitations of generalizability. Conclusion: Adults with HIV were more likely to smoke and less likely to quit smoking than the general adult population.

347,Civil commitment of the anorexic patient,"Involuntary adherence appears to be an rarely used intervention in anorexic patients, in part because of clinicians' uncertainty about its applicability to this population. Unlike overtly suicidal patients, anorexic patients are often unable to express an intention to harm themselves, although their actions may result in serious harm. However, examination of the language of civil commitment laws shows that when anorexic patients' behavior puts their lives in danger, they will often be blamed under severe disability standards. This appears to be in line with the practice of specialists in the treatment of anorexia and practice in other countries. When patients voluntarily refuse hospitalization and their physical safety is at risk, involuntary commitment should be used as a last resort. In addition, civil commitment should probably also be limited to situations where therapeutic gain from hospitalization is likely. Many severely ill anorexic patients will lack the competence to make treatment decisions for themselves and will allow involuntary feeding and other procedures to occur as needed. Civil commitment is a tool that can be legally used in an emergency in anorexic patients.",0,0,
348,Classifications in mental health,"For the first time in the Ninth Review of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) the section on mental disorders included short dictionary definitions for each category. A series of changes in attitudes and policies at the international and national levels, particularly the reorientation of mental health programs to include behavioral and psychosocial issues, came at an opportune time and had a positive impact on the development of proposals for the mental and spiritual chapter. Behavioral disorders in the Tenth Revision (ICD-10). This has enabled WHO to undertake an intensive and comprehensive assessment of international needs in the classification of mental disorders and, where the situation is not clear, to organize field trials to provide the empirical data necessary for problem solving. The result is a set of congruent classifications of mental and behavioral disorders based on ICD-10. The first, produced mainly as a reference tool for statistical purposes, will be included in ICD-10 with short glossary definitions as in ICD-9. Other editions will be published for clinicians practicing for research (with complete definitions, diagnostic guidelines and diagnostic criteria) (with advanced dictionary definitions followed by diagnostic guidelines); for use in the provision of services to the mentally ill; and for use in general health (primary) care. In addition, there will be a multi-axial classification of mental disorders in children to describe the clinical syndrome, resulting disability and environmental factors.Adapted to the needs of different groups working in mental health, it is hoped that these versions will lead to further improvements in communication between service delivery and caregivers.",0,0,
349,Classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing depression symptoms in high-risk adolescents: a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy with attention control and regular school service for adolescents at high risk of depression. DESIGN Three-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled trial. SET Eight UK secondary schools. PARTICIPANTS Adolescents aged 12-16 years (n=5030) in 8-11 school year groups. Year groups were randomly assigned to cognitive behavioral therapy, attention control, or regular school service in a 1:1:1 ratio. The allocation is balanced by school, year, number of students and classes, lesson frequency and timetable. Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. INTERVENTIONS Cognitive behavioral therapy, attention control, and regular school service provided in classrooms to all eligible participants. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Results were collected through a self-filled questionnaire administered by the researchers. The primary outcome was depression symptoms assessed at 12 months with the brief mood and emotions questionnaire among those identified at baseline as at high risk of depression. Secondary outcomes included negative thinking, self-worth, and anxiety. Analyzes were made with the intent to base and take into account the aggregated nature of the design. RESULTS 1064 (21.2%) adolescents were determined to be at high risk of depression: 392 in the classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the normal school provisioning arm. At 12 months, the adjusted mean scores on the brief mood and emotions questionnaire did not differ from usual school service for cognitive behavioral therapy versus attention control (-0.63, 95% confidence interval -1.85 to 0.58, P=0.41) or cognitive behavioral therapy (0.97, -0.20 to 2.15, P=0.12). CONCLUSION In adolescents with depressive symptoms, outcomes were similar for attention control, usual school service, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy programs can result in increased self-awareness and reporting of depressive symptoms, but should not be undertaken without further evaluation and research.

DESIGN Single-blind, parallel group, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. SET 35 general practice in southern England between October 2008 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS Head movement (patient-confirmed) in patients 18 years of age or older with chronic dizziness (mean duration > five years) and not attributable to non-vestibular causes (GP-confirmed). INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive routine medical care, booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation only, or booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation with telephone support. For the booklet approach, participants were given self-management booklets that gave comprehensive advice on performing vestibular rehabilitation exercises at home every day for up to 12 weeks and using cognitive behavioral techniques to encourage positive beliefs and adherence to treatment. Participants who received telephone support were offered three short sessions of structured support from a vestibular therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Vertigo symptom scale-short form and total health care costs related to dizziness per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS Of 337 randomized participants, 276 (82%) completed all clinical measures at the primary endpoint at week 12 and 263 (78%) at one-year follow-up. We analyzed clinical efficacy with intent to treat, controlling for baseline symptom scores, using analysis of covariance to compare groups after intervention. At 12 weeks, scores on the vertigo symptom scale in the telephone support group were not significantly different from those in the routine care group (adjusted mean difference -1.79 (95% CI -3.69 to 0.11), P=0.064). At one year, both intervention groups improved significantly over routine care (phone support -2.52 (-4.52 to -0.51)), P=0.014""; booklet only -2.43 (-4.27 to -0.51) cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that both interventions were highly cost-effective, with very low QALY values the booklet-only approach was more likely to be cost-effective, whereas the approach with additional telephone support was more likely to be QALY were more likely to be cost-effective than at Â£1200 (â€šâ¬1488;”$1932). Using the booklet approach with telephone support, five (three to 12) patients would need to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year.

353,Clinical features associated with prescribing SSRI drugs in adolescents with major unipolar depression,"Unipolar major depressions (MD) occur prominently during adolescence. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK recommends psychological therapies accompanied by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that are prescribed only in severe cases. Here, we attempt to determine the scope and rationale for SSRI prescribing in adolescent MD before engaging in a randomized clinical trial. Prescribing an SSRI with clinical characteristics was determined in 465 adolescent patients with MD prior to receiving a standardized psychological therapy as part of a clinical trial of improving mood with psychoanalytic and cognitive therapies (IMPACT). Overall, 88 (19%) were prescribed antidepressants prior to psychological treatment. Clinical correlations varied by gender: severity of depression in boys and self-harming behaviors in girls, respectively. Prescribing also differed between clinical trial centers. Medical practitioners view the severity of depression in boys as an indicator of antidepressant prescribing. Self-harm in girls appears to be used as a prescribing aid which is inconsistent with past and current revised UK NICE guidelines.",0,0,

Secondary outcomes were mean Edinburgh postpartum depression scale, clinical outcomes on routine assessment-outcome measure (CORE-OM), trait anxiety inventory (STAI), SF-12 and parenting stress index short form (PSI-SF) scores at six. , 12, 18 months. RESULTS 4084 eligible women consented, and 595 women had a six-week EPDS score of >or=12. Of these, 418 had EPDS scores at six weeks and six months. At 6 months, 34% (93/271) of women in the intervention group and 46% (67/147) in the control group had an EPDS score >or=12. The odds ratio for score >or=12 at six months was 0.62 for women in the intervention group compared to women in the control group (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.97, P=0.036). After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratio was 0.60 (0.38 to 0.95, P=0.028). At 6 months, 12.4% (234/1880) of all women in the intervention group and 16.7% (166/995) of all women in the control group had scores >or=12 (0.67, 0.51 to 0.87, P=0.003). . For all women and for women in the intervention group with a six-week EPDS score >or=12, the benefit was maintained at 12 months postpartum. Neither psychological approach had a distinct benefit over the other. CONCLUSION Training of health visitors to assess women, identify symptoms of postpartum depression, and deliver psychologically-informed sessions was clinically effective at six and 12 months postpartum compared with usual care.

356,Clinical global measures of dementia. Statement of the International Working Group on the Harmonization of Dementia Drug Guidelines,"Below is the report of the committee working on clinical global measures for antidementia drug guidelines. The concepts in global scales, the differences between change and severity scales, the advantages and disadvantages of structured interviews, and fixation of change scores are discussed and selected current clinical global scales are defined. In addition, the committee evaluated the usefulness of global scales in clinical trials for antidementia drugs. There was consensus among the working group members on the following: (1) Clinical global scales are interview-based"";"" in most cases, they contain information obtained directly from patients as well as from caregivers, but may rely only on relevant information. (2) Clinicians' overall ratings aim to assess clinically significant change based on multidimensional clinical assessment and at least take into account the clinical heterogeneity of dementia by assessing cognition, behavior, and functioning. (3) There are two different types of clinical global measures: (a) interview-based global severity scales, which often include clinicians categorizing according to disease stage or severity, and (b) clinicians' interview-based global scales of change, which include: global assessment ratings of clinical change. The committee could not reach a consensus on whether global scales are required in phase II and phase III clinical trials, or whether other specific assessments, such as well-designed measures of activities of daily living, cognition, and behavior when used in appropriate combinations, are required. , rather than global as assessments of clinical relevance.",0,0,
357,Clinical governance in the management of labor induction,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the dissemination of clear guidelines developed in consensus with stakeholders for labor induction (IOL) processes reduces variability in clinical practice. DESIGN: A prospective behavior change interventional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The study was carried out in Karachi Aga Khan University, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, between January 1 - August 31, 2002. SUBJECT AND METHODS: A total of 142 women undergoing IOLs in the appropriate sample, predetermined quality assessment indicators were measured. After data collection from the first 71 women (pre-intervention group), mutually agreed guidelines for clinical practice were distributed over a period of time among counselors, assistants, and nurses. These indicators were re-measured in 71 subsequent women (post-intervention group) to assess the magnitude of residual nonconformities in these processes. RESULTS: Following behavior change interventions, counselor non-compliance and timely patient review by counselors (1.4% versus 72, p-value <0.0001), documentation of IOL indication (16.9% versus 66.2%), Assistant-dependent processes such as p-value <0.0001), induction method for IOL (56.3% vs. 28.2%, p-value 0.0001), and calculation of Bishop score before IOL (38.0% vs. 4.2, p value <0.0001) decreased significantly. CONCLUSION: The dissemination of clear guidelines developed in consensus with stakeholders significantly reduces variability in clinical practice. Our model can be used to improve quality of care in other areas of obstetric health care.",0,0,
358,Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior,"BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis within a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to gather information on providers' responses to computer prompts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with non-optimal hypertension care. METHODS: Participants were caregivers of 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive agent at Veterans Affairs primary care clinics. All reasons for action or inaction were listed within a framework to explain the variation in guideline adaptation. RESULTS: 184 negative provider responses to computer alerts included explanations not to change patient therapy"";"" 76 responses to the warnings were positive, meaning the provider would make a change to the antihypertensive regimen. Adverse responses were categorized as implementation inertia (66%), lack of compliance with specific guidelines (5%), patient-based factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). . Most of the 135 providers classified as practice inertia said, ""Stay on current medications and I will discuss them at next visit."" The median number of days to next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days). CONCLUSION: Clinical inertia was the main reason for not attempting otherwise specified treatment change in a subset of patients.

However, the ""experiments"", the quality of the baseline data, the taxonomic classification of phenomena, and the features of clinical reasoning. Over the last 20 years, these developments have not been as extensive as expected because many researchers working in clinical forms of clinical trials have not addressed these fundamental scientific challenges in data, classification, and reasoning. Instead, the researchers applied quantitative ""models"" derived from non-clinical fields, focusing on precise data, random trials, Bayes' theorem, quantitative decision analysis, and psychometric strategies for clinimetric measurement. Consequently, the main challenges of clinical judgment still generally exist for basic scientific research by research clinicians.",0,0,
360,guide to clinical practice guideline development: a quality-focused approach to turning evidence into action,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines turn best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline supports quality by reducing healthcare variation, increasing diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective treatment, and deterring ineffective or potentially harmful interventions. Despite the large number of published guidelines, the methodology is often poorly defined and varies widely within and between organizations. OBJECTIVE: This guide describes the principles and practices that have been successfully used by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to create quality-oriented, evidence-based guidelines using efficient and transparent methodology for action-ready recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. Allowing the transition from idea to completion in 12 months, the development process highlights a logical set of key action statements supported by reinforcing text, evidence profiles, and degrees of recommendation linking action to evidence. CONCLUSIONS: As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key measure of quality healthcare, organizations must develop efficient manufacturing strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must be knowledgeable in understanding what guidelines are and are not, and how they are best used to improve care. The information in this guide should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.",0,0,
361,Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion (Updated),"OBJECTIVE: This update of the 2004 guideline, jointly developed by the American Foundation for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations for managing otitis media with effusion (OME). It is defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of an acute ear infection. Changes to the previous guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews and 49 randomized control trials, greater emphasis on patient education and collaborative decision making, a new algorithm to clarify actionable relationships. and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guide is to identify opportunities for quality improvement in OME management and to create clear and actionable recommendations for applying these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify the children most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients about the favorable natural history of most OMEs and the clinical benefits of medical treatment (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). ). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language assessment, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child between 2 months and 12 years of age with OME, with or without a developmental disability or with or without underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guide is aimed at all clinicians who may be able to diagnose and manage children with OME and is applicable to all settings in which OME will be identified, monitored or managed. However, this guideline does not apply to patients aged 12 years. ACTION STATEMENTS: The update group made strong recommendations for clinicians to (1) document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) perform pneumatic otoscopy to evaluate OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. ; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME with uncertain diagnosis after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy (4) carefully wait and manage the child with OME who is not at risk 3 months from the onset of effusion (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis months (if onset is unknown); (5) not recommend the use of intranasal or systemic steroids in the treatment of OME; (6) recommend not using systemic antibiotics for the treatment of OME; and (7) advise against the use of antihistamines, decongestants, or both for the treatment of OME. ensure that there is an underlying sensorineural work regarding the importance of follow-up to exclude thrust loss, parents of infants with OME who failed newborn screening; (2) determine whether a child with OME is at high risk for speech, language, or learning problems from a middle ear effusion due to underlying sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) assess at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and between 12 and 18 months of age (if diagnosed as at risk before this time); (4) not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) Educate children with OME and their families about the natural history of OME, the need for follow-up and its possible sequelae; (6) an at-risk child should have an age-appropriate hearing test if OME lasts 3 months or longer OR has OME for any period of time; (7) counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reassess children with chronic OME at intervals of 3 to 6 months until the effusion resolves, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (9) recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a 4-year-old child"" and (11) document resolution of OME, improvement in hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.",0,0,
362,Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus,"OBJECTIVE: Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported experiencing tinnitus, causing 10% to 15% of the estimated prevalence in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potential significant impact on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians in management. The focus of this guide is on tinnitus, which is both bothersome and persistent (lasting 6 months or longer) and often negatively impacts the patient's quality of life. The target audience of the guide is any clinician, including non-physicians interested in managing patients with tinnitus. The target patient population is limited to adults (18 years and older) with persistent and bothersome primary tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this guide is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus. This guide provides clinicians with a logical framework for improving patient care and reducing the personal and social effects of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the selection and timing of diagnostic testing and the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including specific referral to identify underlying treatable pathology. It will then focus on the evaluation and treatment of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the assessment and measurement of the impact of tinnitus, and identifying the most appropriate interventions to improve the symptoms and quality of life of tinnitus patients. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians separate patients with bothersome tinnitus from patients with non-irritating tinnitus. The development group made a strong recommendation against performing head and neck imaging studies in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate tinnitus that is not localized to 1 ear, is not pulsating, and is not associated with focal neurological abnormalities or asymmetrical hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: Clinicians should (a) perform a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with presumed primary tinnitus to identify conditions that, if promptly identified and managed, may resolve the tinnitus; (b) should promptly receive information unilateral, comprehensive audiological examination in patients with persistent (>/= 6 months) or hard-of-hearing tinnitus; (c) distinguish patients with recent onset of bothersome tinnitus from patients with persistent symptoms (>/= 6 months) to prioritize intervention and facilitate discussions about history and follow-up care; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus on treatment strategies; (e) recommend a hearing aid evaluation for patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) permanent recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with bothersome tinnitus (a) persistent, comfortable versus antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics or intratympanic drugs for the routine treatment of patients with tinnitus; (b) ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc or other dietary supplements to treat patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: Clinicians can (a) receive an initial comprehensive audiological examination in patients presenting with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status) and (b) recommend sound therapy to patients with persistent tinnitus, irritating tinnitus Development group made no recommendations regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus.",0,0,
363,Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children,"OBJECTIVE: Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure with or without adenoidectomy that cuts the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscle wall and completely removes it together with the tonsil capsule. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate adenoidectomy versus tonsillectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the pre-, intra-, and post-operative care and management of children aged 1 to 18 years who are being considered for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guide is intended for all clinicians in any setting interacting with children aged 1 to 18 years who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based guidance to clinicians in identifying children who are best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary goals are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, to highlight the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, to develop counseling and education for families of children considering tonsillectomy for their children, and to highlight management options for patients with modifying factors. and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: The panel made a strong recommendation for clinicians to administer a single intraoperative single dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations to wait carefully for recurrent throat infection if (1) there were fewer than 7 attacks in the last 2 years, or less than 5 attacks per year in the last 2 years, or less than 3 attacks per year in the last 3 years. ""; (2) evaluation of the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet the criteria in statement 2 to modify factors that may still support tonsillectomy (including but not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis) and adenitis or peritonsillar abscess (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that may improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) abnormal who also have tonsil hypertrophy and SL Counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a way to improve health in children with polysomnography eep-impaired breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further treatment; (6) post-tonsillectomy pain advocating management and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and re-evaluating pain” and (7) clinicians performing tonsillectomy should determine primary and secondary posttonsillectomy bleeding rates at least annually. The panel offered options to propose. Tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years, with documentation in the medical record for each sore throat episode, and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3 grade C, positive test for cervical adenopathy, tonsil exudate, or group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.",0,0,
364,Clinical practice guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children,"OBJECTIVE: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common outpatient surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are often placed because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube placement, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in the management of children aged 6 months to 12 years, with a tympanostomy tube or in any care setting, as an intervention for any type of otitis media considered for tympanostomy tubes. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group extensively discussed the indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with permanent tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidelines on surgical indications, the group focused on the optional, recommended, or non-advisable considerations of tube placement. Additional emphasis was placed on quality improvement opportunities, particularly in relation to joint decision making and the care of children with existing tubes. STATEMENTS TO ACTION: The development group strongly recommended that clinicians prescribe only topical antibiotic ear drops, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel recommended that (1) clinicians should not insert a tympanostomy tube in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) lasting less than 3 months; (2) clinicians should have an age-appropriate hearing test performed. If OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child is a candidate for tympanostomy tube placement; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube placement to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic EME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians At intervals of 3 to 6 months, children with chronic OME who do not receive a tympanostomy tube until the effusion resolves should be reassessed until significant hearing loss is detected or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; Children with acute otitis media (AOM) should not insert a tympanostomy tube. Order of evaluation for r tube candidacy effusion in both ears; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube placement in children with recurrent AOM with unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion during evaluation for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine whether a child with recurrent AOM or OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media due to major sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) during the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes about the expected duration of tube function, the recommended follow-up schedule, and the detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; “avoiding swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tube. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians can perform tympanostomy tube insertion 3 months or more symptoms attributable to EME, including but not limited to vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or poor quality of life, and (2) clinicians with long-standing unilateral or bilateral OME (chronic OME) Can perform tympanostomy tube placement in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME, as reflected by a B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or more (chronic OME).",0,0,
365,Clinical practice guidelines for severe Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Although severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a common, serious, and costly public health problem, several practice guidelines are available to help physicians manage the disorder. METHODS: A search was conducted in English-language medical databases from 1996 to present for articles on AD management. The focus of this review was on studies involving patients with severe disease. Studies; Subjects were evaluated considering trial design, analyzes, and results. The recommendations were based on the best available evidence. RESULTS: Severe AD can be reliably identified and diagnosed using measures of cognition, function, behavior, and global staging. Specific assessments will also include medical condition, safety considerations, and the caregiver's health status. Disease-specific management includes treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with non-pharmacological behavioral and environmental approaches. Severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis, which are potentially dangerous to the patient, caregiver, and others, can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, taking into account the increased risks of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. All pharmacological approaches require careful monitoring and regular periodic reassessments to determine whether ongoing therapy is necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of severe AD have the potential to improve patient and caregiver quality of life. More randomized controlled trials are urgently needed, specifically targeting this stage of the disease.",0,0,
366,Clinical practice guidelines to improve shared decision making on assistive device use in home care: a pilot intervention study,"This study examines whether clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the introduction of assistive devices (ADs) in home care improve joint decision making about AD use and alter social-cognitive correlates. Data were collected in a quasi-experimental design intervention study. The questionnaires were obtained from 116 home nurses and home care workers and their 140 disabled clients. Significant differences between the intervention and control groups revealed that CPG practice improved the self-reported practice of home nurses and home care workers: the number of intervention methods they applied increased and the methods applied with increasing intensity. Nurses' attitudes towards introducing FHs in a joint decision-making process decreased over time in both the intervention group and the control group. Patients' reports of caregivers' practices showed little agreement with caregivers' own reports. The complexity of the CPG and a significant time investment were reported as the main barriers to engaging customers in the collaborative decision-making process through the experimental CPG. However, the CPG is committed to joint decision-making on the use of AD between formal caregivers and community-dwelling people with disabilities. The findings suggest that this CPG can structure communication between caregiver and client and support caregivers in facilitating self-determination in dealing with clients' disabilities.",0,0,
367,Clinical Practice Update: Expert Review on Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Multiple endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) are currently under evaluation or in clinical use in the United States. EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the management of obesity and metabolic diseases. The purpose of this expert review is to update gastroenterologists about these treatments and provide practical advice on how to incorporate them into clinical practice. METHODS: The evidence reviewed in this study is a summary of an extensive search of several English-language databases and a manual review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and meeting summaries). Best Practice Recommendation 1: EBTs should be considered in obese patients who fail to lose or maintain weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Recommendation 2: EBTs can be used as a bridge to conventional bariatric surgery in patients with severe obesity. They can also be used as a bridge to allow for unrelated interventions (orthopedic surgery, organ transplant) that cannot be performed due to weight limitations. Best Practice Recommendation 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior change during both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Recommendation 4: Before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EDTs, clinicians should screen all potential EDT candidates with a comprehensive assessment for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition. Best Practice Recommendation 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should prospectively monitor patients to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities and all related adverse outcomes. Poor responders should be identified and a thorough evaluation and alternative treatment recommended. Best Practice Recommendation 6: Clinicians beginning to incorporate EDTs into their clinical practice should have comprehensive knowledge of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and consequences of individual EDTs, as well as practical knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative treatments. obesity. Best Practice Recommendation 7: Institutions should establish specific guidelines for granting privileges in EBTs that are applied consistently across disciplines and that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill a clinician must acquire before privileges are granted to perform these procedures.",0,0,
368,Clinical practice variation in reduced fetal movements,"BACKGROUND: Decreased fetal movements indicate a risky pregnancy. This is present in a significant proportion of pregnancies, but both the quality of information and the quality of clinical care are variable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All maternity units in eastern Norway and Bergen have registered all consultations for reduced fetal movements as part of the international collaborative project ""Fetal Movement Intervention Evaluation"" (Femina). 1200 pregnancies out of 23,933 births were analyzed. In 1043 pregnancies, the mother expressed her concern about the decrease in spontaneous fetal movements, which were included in the analysis. The results were presented with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Asphyxia, death, growth retardation or preterm delivery occurred in 19.6% (16.6 - 22.6% of cases ranged from 9.1% to 26.5% Standard procedures were very diverse; Ultrasonography was used in 39.0% to 98.6% of cases and Doppler was used in 4.5% to 74.6% of cases. There was a correlation between the results and the procedures used. The risk was increased in women who waited 24 hours with reduced mobility or absence before seeking health care. 47% (42-52%) of those who were sedentary had such risky behaviors. COMMENT: Quality improvements are needed in the clinical management of affected pregnancies as well as in information for pregnant women. This can have great health benefits. We propose new guidelines for information and management.",0,0,
369,Clinical practice. Later orthodontic complications caused by risk factors observed in the first years of life,"Primary preventive strategies for oral health are a key public health priority. Pediatricians are in frequent contact with families during routine preventive visits during the first few years of a child's life and are in an ideal and unique position to advise parents on the prevention of oral disease in their child. Primary prevention is always recommended in very young children to promote positive outcomes in childhood and later adulthood. The knowledge acquired by pediatricians about orofacial enlargement can enhance the implementation and eventual success of a preventive program. Given the widespread lack of orthodontic knowledge among pediatricians, this article describes the most common and distinctive symptoms that often occur in the early stages of a child's development and are easily detectable by clinicians. It is difficult to define preventive strategies to prevent malocclusion due to its multifactorial origin. However, there are some recognized behaviors that should be discouraged to allow for ideal craniofacial development, and some that require early referral to the orthodontist. The following disorders are easily diagnosed by the pediatrician or parents and represent situations in which early intervention may be appropriate to prevent possible future orofacial dysfunction: Differential sucking habits, mouth breathing, and significant deviations from established norms of teeth eruption that persist after 3 years of age. When any of these conditions are observed, early referral to a pediatric dentist or orthodontist is recommended. In general, measures to prevent malocclusion should be based on providing good incentives to promote normal growth and development of the face and eliminating potential interferences that could harm these processes.",0,0,
370,Clinical reminders added to echocardiography reports of patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction increase beta-blocker use: a randomized trial.,"Background - Although ÃŸ-blockers are known to prolong survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, they are often underused. We hypothesized that a reminder added to the echocardiography report would increase the use of ÃŸ-blockers in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Methods and Results - We randomized 1546 consecutive patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <45% on echocardiography in one of 3 laboratories to use ÃŸ-blockers or no reminders. Patients were excluded from analysis if they died within 30 days of randomization (n=89), did not receive medication through the Veterans Affairs system after 30 days (n=180), or had echocardiography performed at >1 laboratory (n=6). The primary outcome was an oral ÃŸ-blocker prescription 1 to 9 months after randomization. The mean age of 1271 patients included was 69 years; 60% had a history of heart failure and 51% were receiving ÃŸ-blocker therapy during echocardiography. More patients randomized to a reminder received a later prescription of an ÃŸ-blocker (74,458 of 621) compared to those randomized to no reminder (66%, 428/650; “P=0.002).” It differs depending on location (inpatient vs. outpatient) or previous use of ÃŸ-blockers.Conclusions—A reminder added to the echocardiography report has increased the use of ÃŸ-blockers in patients with depressed left ventricular systolic function.",1,1,
371,Clinical research in interventional pain management techniques: the clinician's perspective,"Interventional pain management techniques are considered for patients whose pain has proven to be resistant to conventional therapy. According to evidence-based medicine (CPA) guidelines, the highest level of evidence for the efficacy and safety of a treatment is produced in high-quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. A randomized controlled trial is defined as an experiment that determines the effect of an intervention on the natural course of the disease; this means that the comparative group should receive a sham intervention, a placebo in the case of interventional pain management techniques. The systematic review summarizes the results of the available information in a structured way. When randomized controlled trials are available, observational studies will generally be rejected. As new information about a treatment becomes available, the perceived value may change, thereby determining the survival time of clinical evidence. This survival time is not different based on randomized or non-randomized studies. Inclusion criteria are an important component of the randomized controlled trial and are designed to test a treatment in a homogeneous patient population. It should be emphasized that since interventional pain management techniques are mainly used in the treatment of spinal pain, there is no gold standard for diagnosis. This lack of validated standard diagnostic procedures lies at the root of different patient selection criteria, making interpretation of different randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses very difficult. In addition, extrapolation of randomized controlled trials with carefully selected patient populations to daily practice is a major problem. Randomized controlled trials of interventional pain management techniques have often proven to be inadequate; this may be attributed to the difficulty in motivating patients and referring physicians to participate in a trial where there was a 50% chance of receiving a placebo/dummy treatment for persistent pain. In addition, the validity of the sham intervention as a reflection of the natural course of the disease is questioned. It is noted that any new technique should prove to be at least equally effective as the best available treatment option, offering the possibility to compare two groups that both receive active therapy. The reference treatment may be pharmacological or a rehabilitation program (cognitive-behavioral), in which case blinding becomes a problem. It has been shown that large observational studies with a cohort or case-control design do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of associations between exposure and outcome compared with results from randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need for guidelines for conducting prospective cohort trials that should be designed to confirm or refute anecdotal findings from retrospective studies.",0,0,

DESIGN Prospective multicenter cohort. SETTING Five centers in Auckland, New Zealand""; Adelaide, Australia; Manchester and London, UK;"" and Cork, Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS 3572 nulliparous women with ""healthy"" singleton pregnancies from a large international study"";"" Data on pregnancy outcomes were available for 3529 (99%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Preeclampsia defined as 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg, or both, at least twice four hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation, but before onset of labor or postpartum, with proteinuria or any multisystem complication. Preterm preeclampsia was defined as women with preeclampsia who gave birth before 37(+0) gestational week. In the stepwise logistic regression, the comparison group was women without preeclampsia. RESULTS Preeclampsia developed in 186 (5.3%) of 3529 women, 47 (1.3%) with preterm preeclampsia. Clinical risk factors at 14-16 weeks of pregnancy are age, mean arterial blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), family history of preeclampsia, family history of coronary heart disease, maternal birth weight, and vaginal bleeding for at least five years. days. Factors associated with miscarriage were a single previous miscarriage with the same partner, taking at least 12 months to conceive, high fruit intake, smoking, and first trimester alcohol use. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) under internal verification is 0.71. Adding uterine artery Doppler indices did not improve performance (internal validation AUC 0.71). A framework for specialist referral has been developed based on preeclampsia or abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveform generated by at least 15% of a subset of women with single risk factors. Nine percent of nulliparous women are referred for expert opinion, and 21% of these develop preeclampsia. The relative risk of developing preeclampsia and preterm preeclampsia in women referred to a specialist was 5.5 and 12.2, respectively, compared with standard care. CONCLUSIONS Using the clinical phenotype, the ability to predict preeclampsia in healthy non-delivery women is moderate and requires external validation in other populations. If confirmed, it could provide a personalized clinical risk profile for nulliparous women to which biomarkers can be added. Trial registration ACTRN12607000551493.",0,0,

376,Cluster randomized trial of a multilevel evidence-based quality improvement approach to tailor VA Patient Care Teams to the needs of female Veterans,"Background The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has taken a major initiative to transform care through the implementation of Patient-Oriented Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) concept, PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination, and inclusiveness using patient-centered and patient-centered team-based care. However, how the VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of special populations such as female Veterans (WVs) was not considered in the initial practice guideline. The WVsÂ¡Â¯ numerical minority (approximately 7Â¨C8 of users) in VA healthcare settings creates logistical challenges for providing gender-sensitive comprehensive care. The main aim of this study is to combine comprehensive primary care services and gender-specific care in gender-sensitive settings, to test an evidence-based quality improvement approach (EBQI) to adapt PACT to meet the needs of the World, thereby enabling PACT to to accelerate its success. guidelines for women (WomenÂ¡Â¯s Health (WH)-PACT). Methods/design EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multi-level research-clinical partnership with researchers that engages senior organizational leaders and local quality improvement (QI) teams to adapt and implement new models of care in the context of prior evidence and local practice conditions. technical support, formative feedback and practical facilitation. In a 12-site randomized cluster study, we will evaluate the success of the WH-PACT model using patient, provider, staff, and practice questionnaires in addition to analyzes of secondary administrative and chart-based data. We will explore the effects of receiving WH-PACT care on the quality of chronic disease care and prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and care experience, provider experience, utilization, and costs. Using mixed methods, we will assess pre-implementation contexts""; document EBQI activities performed at participating facilities and their relationship to provider/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT implementation; and through a combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly formative progress narratives and administrative data Examining barriers/facilitators to EBQI-supported WH-PACT implementation Discussion The absence of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has had implications for technical quality and ratings of care among WVs and may contribute to decisions about using or seeking care elsewhere under the US Affordable Care Act. We hypothesize that adapting PACT implementation through EBQI can improve care experience and quality on many levels.",0,1,
377,Cluster randomized trials for pharmacy practice research,"Introduction Randomized cluster trials (CRTs) are now the gold standard in healthcare research, including pharmacy-based interventions. Research on behavior, epidemiology, lifestyle changes, education programs, and health care models draws on the strengths of cluster randomized analyzes. Methodology The main feature of CRTs is the randomization unit (clusters), which can differ from the analysis unit (individual). The subject sample size and ideally the number of clusters are determined by the inter- and intra-cluster variability relationship. The correlation between participants from the same cluster is known as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In general, having more clusters with smaller ICC values will result in smaller sample sizes. When selecting clusters, stratification prior to randomization may be useful in reducing imbalances between study arms. Because it is not always possible to blind a behavioral intervention, participant recruitment methods may differ from other types of randomized trials. When to use CRTs can have implications for making ""real world"" decisions. CRTs are often used in non-therapeutic intervention studies (eg change in practice guidelines). The advantages of CRT design in pharmaceutical research are the prevention of contamination and the generalizability of results. A large CRT examining physician-pharmacist collaborative hypertension management is used as an example of CRT in this article. The trial, now titled Collaboration Between Pharmacists and Physicians to Improve Outcomes (CAPTION), was implemented in primary care offices in the United States for hypertensive patients. Limitations CRT design limitations include the need for large numbers of clusters, high costs, increased training, increased monitoring, and statistical complexity.",0,0,
378,Cluster randomized controlled trial of computer-based decision support to select long-term anti-thrombotic therapy after acute ischemic stroke.,"Background: Identifying appropriate long-term anti-thrombotic therapy following acute ischemic stroke is a challenging area where computer-based decision support can provide assistance. Objective: To evaluate the impact of a computer-based decision support system (CDSS) on prescribing practice that provides patient-specific estimates of expected ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular event rates under each potential anti-thrombotic therapy. Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial. Methods: We recruited patients presenting for initial investigation of symptoms of ischemic stroke or TIA, excluding those with a poor prognosis or major contraindication for anticoagulation. After observing routine prescribing (6 months) at each hospital, centers were randomized for 6 months to control (routine practice observed) or intervention (practice observed while CDSS provided patient-specific information). Between control and intervention centers, we compared the risk reduction achieved with long-term anti-thrombotic therapy (estimated by CDSS) for ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular events and the proportions of subjects prescribed optimal therapy as determined by CDSS. Results: Sixteen hospitals recruited 1952 subjects. When the CDSS provided information, the mean relative risk reduction achieved with prescribing increased by 2.7 percent (95% CI -0.3 to 5.7), and the odds ratio for optimal treatment prescribed was 1.32 (0.83 to 1.80). ) was. Approximately 55% (5/9) of clinicians believed that CDSS affected their prescribing. Conclusions: Cluster-randomized trials provide excellent frameworks for evaluating new clinical management methods. Our CDSS was practical and acceptable to clinicians, but did not significantly affect prescribing practice for antithrombotic drugs after acute ischemic stroke.",1,1,
379,The COACH trial: a randomized controlled trial of GP/PHC cardiovascular disease risk reduction in urban community health centers: rationale and design,"BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of risk-reducing practices remains inadequate. This article describes the rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial that evaluated the efficacy of a comprehensive CVD risk reduction program delivered by NP/CHW teams versus enhanced usual care in improving patient proportion. Urban community health centers achieving target levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c and prescribing appropriate drugs. METHODS: The COACH (Community Assistance and Cardiovascular Health) study was a randomized controlled trial in which patients at federally qualified community health centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: comprehensive intensive management of CVD risk factors for one year by an NP. CHW team or an advanced routine maintenance control group. RESULTS: A total of 3899 patients were evaluated for eligibility and 525 patients were randomized. The groups were comparable at baseline for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, except for statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a novel blend of multilevel interdisciplinary strategies to transform highly effective therapies into low-income, federally funded healthcare centers caring for patients with a disproportionate CVD burden, type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled CVD risk factors.

381,Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) is now widely recommended as first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, as psychological approaches are likely to produce sustained benefits without the tolerance or risk of side effects associated with pharmacological approaches. Purpose: To determine the efficacy of CBT-i in daily measurements of night sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed Clinical Queries searches from baseline to March 31, 2015 were supported by manual scanning. Study Selection: Randomized, controlled trials comparing the efficacy of face-to-face, multimodal CBT-i on nighttime sleep with inactive comparators in adults with chronic insomnia. Studies of insomnia comorbid with medical, sleep, or psychiatric disorders were excluded. Data Extraction: Study characteristics, quality, and data were evaluated independently by 2 reviewers. The main outcome measures were sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (%SE). Data Synthesis: Among the 292 citations and 91 full-text articles reviewed, 20 studies (1162 participants [64% female"";"" mean age, 56 years]) were included. CBT-i approaches include at least 3 of the following: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. At the post-treatment time point, SOL increased 19.03 (95% CI, 14.12 to 23.93) minutes, WASO 26.00 (CI, 15.48 to 36.52) minutes, TST 7.61 (CI, ?0.51 to 15.74) minutes, and SE increased 9.91% (CI, 8.09% to 11.73%). Changes appeared to be sustained at later time points. No adverse results were reported. Limitation: Narrow inclusion criteria limited applicability in patients with insomnia and other sleep problems, and the accuracy of the estimates at later time points was less clear. Conclusion: CBT-i is an effective treatment for adults with chronic insomnia with clinically significant effect sizes. Primary Source of Funding: None.

382,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Women,"Context The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high among women who have served in the military, but there are no studies evaluating previous PTSD treatment in this population. Previous research suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy is an especially effective treatment for PTSD. Purpose To compare prolonged exposure, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, with present-centered therapy, a supportive intervention for the treatment of PTSD. Design, Environment, and Participants A randomized controlled trial of female veterans (n=277) and active-duty personnel (n=7) with PTSD recruited from 9 VA medical centers, 2 VA readjustment counseling centers, and 1 military hospital since August 2002. until 2005. Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to receive either prolonged exposure (n = 141) or present-centered therapy (n = 143) delivered according to standard protocols in 10 weekly 90-minute sessions. Main Outcome Measures Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity was the primary outcome. Comorbid symptoms, functioning, and quality of life were secondary outcomes. Blind raters collected data before and after treatment and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Results Women who received long-term exposure experienced greater reductions in PTSD symptoms (effect size, 0.27""; P = .03) than women who received current centered treatment. longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria (41.0% vs. 27.8%; odds ratio). , 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.96; P = .01) and achieve total remission (6.9% versus 15.2%; odds ratio, 2.43; 95% confidence) range, 1.10-5.37;"" P = .01).

383,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Zopiclone for the Treatment of Chronic Primary Insomnia in Older Adults,"Context Insomnia is a common condition in older adults and is associated with a range of adverse medical, social, and psychological outcomes. Previous research has suggested beneficial results of both psychological and pharmacological treatments, but blinded placebo-controlled studies comparing the effects of these treatments are lacking. Purpose To examine the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological therapy in older adults with chronic primary insomnia. Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 46 adults (mean age, 60.8 y""; 22 women) with chronic primary insomnia conducted in a single university outpatient in Norway between January 2004 and December 2005. One study clinical intervention for adults and elderly patients CBT (sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation; n = 18), sleep medication (zopiclone 7.5 mg each night; n = 16), or placebo medication (n = 12) ) Total treatment duration was 6 weeks and 2 active treatments followed at 6 months Main Outcome Measures Outpatient clinical polysomnographic data and sleep diaries were used to determine total awakening time, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slowing Wave sleep at all 3 assessment points (using polysomnography only) Results CBT resulted in better short- and long-term outcomes compared to zopiclone in 3 out of 4 outcome measures. For most outcomes, zopiclone was not different from placebo. Participants taking the zopiclone increased their sleep efficiency from 81.4% pre-treatment to 90.1% at 6-month follow-up, compared with a decrease from 82.3% to 81.9% in the zopiclone group. Participants in the CBT group spent much more time in slow-wave sleep (stages 3 and 4) and were less awake during the night than the other groups. Total sleep duration was similar in all 3 groups; “At 6 months, patients receiving CBT had better sleep efficiency using polysomnography than those receiving zopiclone. Conclusion These results suggest that CBT-based interventions are superior to zopiclone therapy in both the short and long term. Period management of insomnia in adults.",0,0,
384,Cognitive bias 2: barriers and strategies to change,"In a supplementary article, we suggested that cognitive bias is a necessary skill in developing sound clinical reasoning to reduce the incidence of diagnostic failure. We examined the origins of cognitive biases and some suggested mechanisms for how bias reduction processes might work. In this article, we first outline a general scheme of how cognitive change occurs and the constraints that can be applied. We review various individual factors, many of which are self-biased and may be a barrier to change. We will then examine major strategies developed in the social sciences and medicine to achieve cognitive and affective bias, including the concept of important coercive functions. The abundance and rich diversity of approaches available in the literature and in individual clinical areas illustrate the inherent difficulties in achieving cognitive change, as well as the need for such interventions. Persistent cognitive bias is arguably the most important characteristic of the critical thinker and well-calibrated mind. We outline three groups of proposed prospective interventions: educational strategies, workplace strategies, and coercion functions. We emphasize the importance of environmental and contextual influences on the quality of individual decision-making and the need to address factors known to decalibrate the decision maker. We also emphasize the importance of introducing these concepts at undergraduate level in medical education and the natural development of critical thinking education.",0,1,

387,"Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Panic Disorder, Imipramine, or Combination","Context Panic disorder (PD) can be treated with medications, psychosocial intervention, or both, but the relative and combined effects have not been objectively evaluated. The aim is to evaluate whether drug and psychosocial therapies for PD are each more effective than placebo, whether one treatment is more effective than the other, and whether the combined treatment is more effective than either treatment alone. Design and Adjustment Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 4 anxiety research clinics from May 1991 to April 1998. Patients A total of 312 Parkinson's patients were included in the analysis. Interventions Patients received imipramine up to 300 mg/day only (n=83); cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) only (n=77); placebo only (n=24); CBT plus imipramine (n=65) or CBT plus placebo (n=63) Patients were treated weekly for 3 months (acute phase), then responders were seen monthly for 6 months (maintenance phase) and then followed for 6 months after discontinuation of treatment.

Impact on depression in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention in primary care with the efficacy of primary care physician ""as usual"" in patients with depression. Design: A randomized controlled trial among primary care patients with major or minor depression. PATIENTS: A total of 217 primary care patients who were deemed depressed by primary care physicians and willing to take antidepressant medication over a 12-month period were randomized, 91 meeting criteria for major depression and 126 for minor depression. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention patients received increased intensity and frequency of visits during the first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment (visits 1 and 3 with a primary care physician, visits 2 and 4 with a psychiatrist) and continued monitoring of adherence to medication regimens during continuation. and maintenance stages of treatment. Patient education at these visits was videotaped and supplemented with written materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included short-term (30 days) and long-term (90 days) antidepressant medication use at guideline dosage levels, satisfaction with overall care for depression and antidepressant medication, and reduction in depressive symptoms. RESULTS: In patients with major depression, the intervention group had greater adherence to an adequate dose of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more than usual maintenance controls (75.5% vs. 50.0%""; P < .01), the quality of care they received for depression was good. to excellent (93.0% vs. 75.0%; P < .03) and were more likely to rate antidepressant medications as greatly helpful (88.1% vs. 63.3%; P < .3) .01 Percentage of intervention patients with major depression Seventy-four showed 50% or greater improvement (P < .01) on the Symptom Checklist-90 Depressive Symptom Scale compared to 43.8% of controls, and intervention patients also had significantly greater reductions in depression severity over time compared with controls (P < .01). .004) In patients with minor depression, the intervention group showed significantly greater adherence to adequate-dose antidepressant medication for 90 days or more than controls (79.7% vs. 3%; P < .001) and more frequently Additionally, antidepressant medications were assessed as being highly helpful (81.8% vs. 61.4%; “P < .02).

391,Collective action for implementation: a realistic assessment of institutional collaboration in healthcare.,"Background Research It is increasingly suggested that translation gaps can be eliminated or narrowed by bringing users and producers closer together, a theory largely untested. This document reports on a national study to fill the gap in the evidence on conditions, processes and outcomes related to cooperation and implementation. Methods A longitudinal realistic assessment using multiple qualitative method case studies was conducted with the three Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research in Care (UK). Data were collected through four rounds of theory development, refinement, and testing. More than 200 participants participated in semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations of events and meetings, and stakeholder engagement. The combined inductive and deductive data analysis process focused on proposition refinement and iterative testing over rounds of data collection. Conclusions The quality of existing relationships between higher education and local health care and views on whether implementation is a joint action created a path dependency. When the app was perceived to be decommissioned and lack of organizational connections, this resulted in a focus on knowledge generation and transfer rather than co-production. CollaborationÂ¡Â¯ architectures were inefficient as they did not facilitate connectivity and emphasized professional and epistemic boundaries. More distributed leadership was associated with greater participation potential. The creation of roles that span borders was the most visible investment in practice, and trusted people in these roles resulted in cross-border work, facilitation and direct influences. The academic-practice distinction emerged strongly as a context for motivation to engage, because Â¡Â®that for me Â¡Â¯ resulted in varying levels of engagement along a collaborative-collaboration continuum. Learning within and between collaborations was disorganized due to the attention given to assessment. Results These collaborations did not emerge from a vacuum and needed time to learn and develop. Their lifecycle began with their position on collaboration, knowledge and application. More effective initiatives in collective action in practice can be determined by the deliberate alignment of a number of features, including key relationships, vision, values, structures and processes, and views on collaboration and the nature of practice.",0,0,
392,Colonoscopy recruitment for high-risk individuals with a family history of colorectal neoplasia: A multicenter randomized counseling trial against standardized information.,"OBJECTIVE: Colonoscopic screening is recommended before the age of 60 in first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) or colorectal adenomatous polyp (CAP). This has the potential to reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality, but uptake is currently insufficient. METHODS: The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of standardized information with a nurse-led specific intervention designed to encourage the uptake of colonoscopy screening by siblings of patients with CRC or CAP. A randomized controlled trial was performed. Digestive surgeons and gastroenterologists recruited index patients who developed CRC or CAP before age 60. All index patients received standard screening information for siblings in accordance with current guidelines. Centrally computerized randomization of index patients resulted in all siblings being allocated to the same group, intervention, or control. The specific intervention primarily targeted the index patient to help them relay information to their siblings. The nurse then provided siblings specific information based on their responses to a self-questionnaire investigating health behaviors derived from psychosocial prevention models. The siblings were then given a personalized information leaflet to give to their regular doctor. The primary endpoint was the rate of documented colonoscopy performed in siblings within 1 year of diagnosis of the index patient. Intent-to-treat analysis included siblings who declined to participate in the study. Statistical analysis was adjusted for intra-familial correlation. RESULTS: A total of 304 siblings of 125 index patients, 160 in the intervention group and 144 in the control group, were included. Colonoscopy uptake rate among siblings was 56.3% in the intervention group and 35.4% in the control group (P = 0.0027). The rates after excluding rejections were 69.2% and 37.0% (P < 0.0001). More lesions were detected in the intervention group (1 invasive cancer and 5 advanced adenomas versus 11 advanced adenomas""; ""P = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a nurse-led private intervention designed to encourage the uptake of colonoscopy screening by siblings of patients diagnosed with CRC or CAP before age 60.

Objective: To evaluate diet and physical activity improvement programs for people at high risk of type 2 diabetes, primarily to reduce diabetes risk and reduce body weight and glycemia. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, Global Health, and Ovid Health-STAR 1991 to February 27, 2015 without language restrictions. Study Selection: Eight researchers searched articles for single group or comparative studies of at least 2 sessions of combined diet and physical activity enhancement programs for at least 3 months in participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Data Extraction: 7 investigators extracted data on study design""; participant, intervention, and outcome descriptions;"" and outcomes and the quality of the evaluated study. Data Synthesis: 53 studies (30 diet and physical activity enhancement programs and usual care, 13 more intensive and less intensive programs, and 13 single programs) evaluated 66 programs. Reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio [RR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.66]) (16 studies), reduced body weight compared with usual maintenance, diet, and physical activity promotion programs ( net change, -2.2% [ CI, -2.9% to -1.4%]) (24 studies) and fasting blood glucose level (net change, -0.12 mmol/L [-2.2 mg/dL] [CI, -0.20] to -0.05 mmol/L {-3.6] -0.9 mg/ dL}]) (17 studies) and other cardiometabolic risk factors. Evidence for clinical events was limited. More intense programs were more effective. Limitations: The wide variety in diet and physical activity enhancement programs limited the identification of the characteristics most relevant to activity. Clinical outcomes and evidence in children were scarce. Conclusion: Combined diet and physical activity enhancement programs are effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes and improving cardiometabolic risk factors in people at high risk. More intensive programs are more effective.",0,0,
394,Combining intensive nurse counseling or brief GP advice with varenicline for smoking cessation in primary care: a study protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Combining behavioral support and pharmacotherapy is most effective in smoking cessation and is recommended in clinical guidelines. Although GP help to quit smoking can be effective, dissemination of clinical practice guidelines and efforts to develop skills has not led to the routine provision of smoking cessation advice among GPs. Intensive counseling from the practice nurse can contribute to better smoking cessation rates in primary care. However, the effectiveness of intensive counseling by a GP versus the usual care of a GP in combination with varenicline is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: (a) intensive individual counseling by a practice nurse and (b) brief advice by a GP both groups received 12 weeks of open-label varenicline. At least 272 adult smokers per day recruited and treated in a routine primary care setting Primary outcome was defined as prolonged abstinence from weeks 9 to 26, biochemically confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide Data were analyzed blindly on the goal-to-treat principle and associated with smoking status at follow-up Participants with missing data were counted as smokers.Secondary outcomes included: one-year long-term abstinence, short-term incremental cost-effectiveness, medication adherence, and key determinants of successful smoking cessation.CONCLUSION: This study was intensive practice nurse combined with varenicline in real-life conditions. effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and potential impact of counseling This is the first study to provide scientific evidence about its mechanisms.

395,Comfort First: evaluation of a procedural pain management program for children with cancer,"BACKGROUND: The Comfort First Program (CFP) provides children and their caregivers with an early procedural pain management intervention to reduce procedural pain and distress. This study evaluated whether CFP was achieving its goals and effectively implementing the Royal Australasian College of Physicians pediatric pain management guidelines. METHODS: The study was conducted as a single-site cross-sectional control. One hundred and thirty-five patients (mean age 7.7 years) treated at the Children's Cancer Center Day Oncology Unit at the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne were observed. Procedural aspects related to treatment room, caregiver and staff behavior, child distress, and use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were recorded using a control tool developed for the study. RESULTS: The procedure room was regularly quiet and prepared before the child entered. The median processing time was 8 minutes. The median transaction wait time was 54 minutes. At least one caregiver was typically present during procedures. Comfort First (CF) clinicians were more likely to engage in procedures with a significantly distressed child. Carers, nurses, and CF clinicians generally displayed comfort-promoting behaviors. Topical anesthetic was used regularly. Non-pharmacological supplements were often used, especially for distraction. Patients under 8 years of age were significantly more likely to receive non-pharmacological support and have a caregiver and CF clinician. Age is an important predictor of distress, with higher rates of distress in younger children. RESULTS: CFP was found to effectively implement procedural pain guidelines. Regular supervision is recommended to ensure compliance with pain management standards.",0,0,
396,Coping with compulsive behavior: a cluster randomized controlled trial on the effects of a multidisciplinary care program for compulsive behavior in dementia.,"OBJECTIVES: The Compulsive Behavior care program was developed using existing guidelines and models for managing challenging behaviors in dementia in nursing homes. It was hypothesized that the use of a maintenance program would lead to a reduction in compulsive behaviors and psychoactive drug prescribing, without an increase in restraint use. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted using a stepped wedge design to implement the maintenance program and evaluate effects. Compulsive behavior and psychoactive drug assessment was performed every 4 months in all participating units, followed by a program of care in a group of 3 to 4 units. A total of 6 evaluations were made over 20 months. SETTING: Seventeen dementia special care units of different nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 659 residents of the special care unit for dementia. All residents with dementia in the unit were included. The units are assigned by the random allocation software to 1 of 5 groups with different starting points for the implementation of the maintenance program. INTERVENTION: A program of care consisting of a variety of assessment procedures and tools that provide a multidisciplinary approach and structure the process of managing challenging behaviors in dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Compulsive behavior was measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and Neuropsychiatry Inventory. Research assistants (blind to the unit's response status) interviewed nurses in the units about compulsive behavior. Data on psychoactive drugs and restrictions were taken from their built-in charts. RESULTS: A total of 2292 assessments (1126 control measures, 1166 intervention measures) including 659 residents were performed. The group of residents who remained in the intervention condition differed significantly in CMAI change scores between consecutive assessments compared with the group in the control condition [-2.4 CMAI score, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.3 to -0.6]. No significant effect was found for the control to intervention group compared to the remaining group in the control group (0.0 CMAI score, 95% CI -2.3 to 2.4). Significant effects on 5 of the 12 Neuropsychiatric Inventory items and use of antipsychotics (odd ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.80) and antidepressants (odd ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.94) found. No effect on the use of restrictions was observed. RESULTS: The Influenza on Challenging behavior program was able to reduce some compulsive behavior patterns and the use of psychoactive drugs.",0,0,

398,"Communication style and exercise compliance (CONNECT) in physiotherapy: A set of randomized controlled trials to test a theory-based intervention to increase patients with chronic low back pain adherence to physiotherapists' advice: study rationale, design and methods","BACKGROUND: Physical activity and exercise therapy are among accepted clinical rehabilitation guidelines and are recommended self-management strategies for chronic low back pain. However, many back pain sufferers do not follow their physical therapist's advice. Poor patient compliance can reduce the effectiveness of referrals and home rehabilitation exercises. According to self-determination theory, support from health care practitioners can promote patients' autonomous motivation and longer-term behavioral persistence (eg, following physical therapists' recommendations). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intervention designed to increase physiotherapists' autonomy-supportive communication on patients with low back pain adherence to physical activity and exercise therapy recommendations. METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Outpatient physiotherapy centers (N = 12) (population = 1.25 million) in Dublin, Ireland will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control arm using a computer generated algorithm. Physiotherapists in the experimental arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will participate in eight hours of communication skills training. Training will include brochures, workbooks, video examples, role playing and discussion designed to teach physiotherapists how to communicate in a way that encourages autonomous patient motivation. Physiotherapists in the waiting list control arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) will not receive this training. Participants with chronic low back pain (N = 292) will complete assessments at baseline and at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after their first physiotherapy appointment. Primary outcomes will include low back pain, function and well-being, as well as following physiotherapy recommendations. Participants will be blinded to treatment allocation as they will not be informed whether their physiotherapist has received communication skills training. Results evaluators will also be blinded. We will use linear mixed modeling to test for arm differences in both mean levels and rates of change of outcome variables. We will use structural equation modeling, including hypothetical mediation effects, to examine the change process. DISCUSSION: This trial will be the first to test the effect of a self-determination theory-based communication skills training program for physiotherapists on low back pain patients' compliance with rehabilitation advice.",0,0,
399,Community occupational therapy for elderly patients with dementia and their caregivers: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of community-based occupational therapy compared with usual care in elderly patients with dementia and their caregivers from a societal perspective. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness study as well as a single-blind randomized controlled trial. AYAR The memory clinic, the day clinic of the geriatrics department and the participants' homes. Patients > or = 135 patients aged > or =65 years with mild to moderate dementia living in the community and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION 10 sessions of occupational therapy over five weeks, including cognitive and behavioral interventions, to educate patients in the use of aids to compensate for cognitive decline and to educate caregivers in coping behaviors and supervision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as the difference in average total care costs per successful treatment three months after randomization (ie, a combined patient and caregiver outcome measure of clinically relevant improvement on process, performance, and proficiency scales). Bootstrap methods used to determine confidence intervals for these measures. RESULTS The cost of intervention was 1183 euros (£848, US$1738) per patient and primary care unit per three months (95% confidence interval: €1128 (£808, US$1657) to 1239 euros (£888, US$1820). The cost of visits to general practitioners and hospital doctors was the same in both groups, but overall average costs were €1748 (£1279, $2621) lower in the intervention group and the main cost savings were in informal care.A significant 36% increase in successful cure rates at three months. The number of patients required to be treated for successful treatment at three months was 2.8 (2.7 to 2.9) CONCLUSIONS Community occupational therapy intervention for patients with dementia and their caregivers is successful and cost-effective, especially in terms of informal care delivery.",0,0,

401,Community-based care for the management of type 2 diabetes: an evidence-based analysis.,"UNLABELED: In June 2008, the Medical Counseling Secretariat began work on the Diabetes Strategy Evidence Project, an evidence-based review of the literature surrounding strategies for successful management and treatment of diabetes. This project came about when the Health System Strategy Division at the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care later asked the secretariat to provide a demonstrative platform for the Ministry's newly published Diabetes Strategy. After an initial review of the strategy and consultation with experts, the Secretariat identified five key areas where evidence was needed. Evidence-based analyzes were prepared for each of these five areas: insulin pumps, behavioral interventions, bariatric surgery, home remote monitoring, and community-based care. For each area, an economic analysis is completed where appropriate and described in a separate report. To review these topics in the Diabetes Strategy Evidence series, please visit the Medical Counseling Secretariat Web site, http://www.health.gov.on .ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.html,DIABETS STRATEGY EVIDENCE PLATFORM: Evidence-Based Summary of Analysis Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pumps for Type 1 and Type 2 Adult Diabetes: An Evidence-Based Analysis Care: An Evidence-Based Analysis Remote Monitoring for Type 2 Diabetes: An Evidence-Based Analysis Ontario Diabetes Practice Economic Model (ODEM) to Determine the Cost-Effectiveness and Budgetary Impact of Selected Type 2 Diabetes Interventions in Ontario To determine the effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary community care for the management of type 2 diabetes. CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND STATUS Diabetes (ie diabetes mellitus) is a highly common chronic metabolic disorder that interferes with the body's ability to produce or use insulin effectively. The majority (90%) of diabetic patients have type 2 diabetes. (1) Based on the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), intensive blood glucose and blood pressure control significantly reduces the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. While many studies have documented that patients generally do not meet the glycemic control targets set by national and international guidelines, factors associated with glycemic control are less well studied, one of which is the caregiver(s). Multidisciplinary approaches to care may be particularly important for diabetes management. According to the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guidelines, the diabetes health care team should be multifaceted and interdisciplinary. Currently in Ontario, the core diabetes healthcare team consists of at least one family practitioner and/or diabetes specialist and diabetes educators (registered nurse and registered dietitian). Increasing the role of allied health professionals in diabetes care and collaborating with doctors can be a more cost-effective option for diabetes management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined multidisciplinary care programs, but these have been either limited to a specific component of multidisciplinary care (eg, intensive education programs) or conducted as part of a broader disease management program that is not all. multidisciplinary in nature. Most reviews do not clearly define the intervention(s) of interest, making evaluation of such multidisciplinary community programs difficult. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS METHODS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary community care for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to normal, provided by at least one registered nurse, registered dietitian, and physician (primary care and/or specialist)? care? [Hereinafter referred to as Model 1] What is the evidence for the effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary community care provided by at least one pharmacist and primary care physician for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care?

A literature review was conducted using the Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published between January 1, 2000, and September 28, 2008. Abstracts were reviewed by a single referee and met eligibility criteria. Full-text paper for studies that meet les were obtained. Reference lists were also reviewed for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles of unknown relevance were reviewed by a second clinical epidemiologist, then by a group of epidemiologists until consensus was reached. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE methodology. Given the high clinical heterogeneity of articles meeting the inclusion criteria, specific models of care currently supported in Ontario, care models widely reported in the literature, as well as specialized multidisciplinary community care, were examined. Recommendations from an Expert Advisory Panel Meeting held on January 21, 2009. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: In the initial search, 2,116 unique citations were identified that met the eligibility criteria of 22 RCT trials and nine published systematic reviews. Of these, five studies focused on care provided by at least one nurse, dietitian, and physician (primary care and/or specialist) care model (Model 1; see Table ES 1), while three focused on care provided by at least one nurse. a pharmacist and primary care physician (Model 2; see Table ES 2) Based on moderate-quality evidence, the specialized multidisciplinary community care Model 2 showed a statistically and clinically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to regular care.

402,Community-based knowledge transfer and exchange: helping community-based organizations connect research to action,"Background Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important stakeholders in health systems and are increasingly required to use research evidence to inform advocacy, program planning and service delivery efforts. CBOs are increasingly turning to community-based research (CBR), given its participatory focus and emphasis on connecting research to action. To further facilitate the use of research evidence by CBOs, we have developed a strategy for community-based knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) that helps CBOs more effectively connect research evidence to action. We developed the strategy as follows: Outlining the key characteristics of CBOs and why they are important stakeholders in health systems; By defining the concepts and methods for CBR and KTE; By comparing the CBR's efforts to link research evidence to action with those discussed in this section. Using the RIT literature and comparison to develop a framework for community-based RIT that builds on both the strengths of CBR and existing RIT frameworks Discussion We find that CBR is particularly effective in fostering a climate for using research evidence and generating relevant research evidence. However, CBOs are not always engaged in activities to connect research evidence to action or evaluate these efforts on a larger scale. Therefore, our community-based RIT strategy focuses on: an expanded model of 'connection' and exchange' (i.e. asking questions together). and manufacturers and users of researchers involved in the response process); Producing and disseminating systematic reviews addressing issues of interest to CBOs; Developing a large-scale evidence service consisting of both ""push"" efforts and efforts to facilitate the ""pull"" emphasizing actionable messages in a user-friendly manner from systematic reviews of the community and rigorous assessments of efforts to connect research evidence to action. The use of research evidence for CBO advocacy, program planning, and service delivery efforts can be better facilitated and continually improved through continuous assessments of its impact.",0,0,

Despite the high rates of deterioration, there are no randomized controlled trials examining the feasibility and effectiveness of mental health interventions for former child soldiers. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based intervention targeting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in individuals with previous abduction. Design, Environment and Participants Randomized controlled trial of 85 former child soldiers with PTSD from a population-based survey of 1113 Northern Ugandans aged 12 to 25 years, conducted in IDP camps between November 2007 and October 2009. Participants were randomized into one of 3 groups: narrative exposure therapy (n = 29), an academic completion program with supportive counseling elements (n = 28), or a waiting list (n = 28). PTSD symptoms and feelings of guilt related to the trauma were measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Relevant sections of the mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to assess depression and suicide risk, and a locally adapted scale was used to measure perceived stigma. PTSD, depression, and related symptoms of impairment were assessed before treatment and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after intervention. Intervention Therapies were delivered directly in the communities in 8 sessions by trained local lay therapists. Key Outcome Measures Change in PTSD severity assessed over the 1-year period after treatment. Secondary outcome measures were symptoms of depression, severity of suicidal ideation, feelings of guilt, and perceived stigma. Results PTSD symptom severity (range, 0-148) improved significantly more in the narrative exposure therapy group than in the academic catch-up (mean variation difference, ?14.06 [95% confidence interval, ?27.19 - ?0.92]) and the waiting group. -list (mean variation difference, ?13.04 [95% confidence interval, ?26.79 to 0.72]) groups.

406,Comparative Benefits and Harms of Second Generation Antidepressants in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder,"Background: Second-generation antidepressants dominate the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the evidence for the comparative benefits and harms of these agents is conflicting. Objective: To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for treating MDD in adults. Data Sources: Reference lists of English studies and related review articles and gray literature from 1980 to August 2011 from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. Study Selection: 2 independent reviewers, least Harm 6-week period to evaluate efficacy and observational studies with at least 1000 participants to evaluate Data Extraction: Reviewers summarized data on study design and conduct, participants and interventions, and outcomes and rated study quality. A senior reviewer checked and approved the extracted data and quality ratings. Data Synthesis: Meta-analyses of response to treatment on specific scales and mixed treatment comparisons and weighted mean differences were performed to rate depression. Based on 234 studies, no clinically significant differences in efficacy or efficacy were found for the treatment of acute, continuation, and maintenance stages of MDD. There were no differences in efficacy in patients with comorbid symptoms or in subgroups based on age, gender, ethnicity, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in some measures of onset of action, adverse events, and health-related quality of life. Limitations: Most trials were conducted in highly selected populations. Publication bias can affect the estimates of some comparisons. Mixed therapy comparisons cannot definitively exclude differences in efficacy. Evidence within subgroups was limited. Conclusion: The available evidence does not warrant the recommendation of a particular second-generation antidepressant based on differences in efficacy. When choosing a drug, differences in onset of action and side effects can be taken into account.",0,0,

For harms, 35 observational studies with at least 100 participants and at least 12 weeks of follow-up were also included. Data Extraction: Using a standard protocol, the researchers provided details on study design and quality, funding, settings, patients, and results. Data Synthesis: If data were adequate, meta-analyses of one-to-one studies were performed to determine the relative benefit of response to treatment and weighted mean differences in specific depression rating scales. If insufficient evidence was available, adjusted indirect comparisons were made using meta-regressions and network meta-analyses. Second-generation antidepressants did not differ significantly in efficacy or efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder on the basis of 203 studies, although the incidence of specific adverse events and onset of effect differed. Evidence, comparative efficacy, efficacy, or harms of these agents for the treatment of dysthymia and subsyndromal depression Limitation: Adjusted indirect comparisons have methodological limitations and cannot definitively rule out differences in efficacy. Conclusion: There is available evidence. Does not warrant preference for one second-generation antidepressant over another on the basis of differences in efficacy and efficacy. The differences may be related to the choice of a drug.",0,0,
408,Comparative effectiveness of additional physician communication training and supervision-feedback to improve cancer screening for patients with limited health literacy,"BACKGROUND: We designed a continuing medical education (CME) program to teach primary care physicians (PCP) how to engage in cancer risk communication and joint decision-making with patients with limited health literacy (HL). OBJECTIVE: In addition to supervision-feedback, we evaluated whether training of PCPs improves communication behaviors and increases cancer screening in patients with limited HL more than simply providing clinical performance feedback. DESIGN: A four-year cluster randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 168 patients with 18 delayed PCP and limited HL for colorectal/breast/cervical cancer screening. INTERVENTIONS: Communication intervention PCPs received skills training that included standardized patient (SP) feedback on counseling behaviors. All PCPs underwent semi-annual chart checks of patients' screening status for up to 24 months and received a two-year performance feedback report. MAIN MEASURES: PCPs experienced three unannounced SP encounters in which SPs rated their PCP communication behavior. We examined group-to-group differences in changes in CP ratings and changes in patients' knowledge of cancer screening guidelines over 12 months, and changes in patient cancer screening rates over 24 months. At follow-up, communication intervention PCPs scored higher in overall communication about cancer risks and co-decision-making about colorectal cancer screening compared to PCPs that received performance feedback only. Screening rates increased among PCP patients in both groups; however, there was no difference in screening rates between the groups, except for mammography. The communication intervention did not improve the patient's cancer screening knowledge. CONCLUSION: Compared with supervision and feedback alone, PCP, including communication training, increases patient-centered counseling behaviors, but does not increase cancer screening in patients with limited HL. Larger studies should be conducted to determine whether the lack of change in cancer screening is due to the clinical/patient sample size or the ineffectiveness of communication education to change outcomes.",0,1,

410,Comparative effectiveness of interventions to improve hand hygiene in the hospital: systematic review and network meta-analysis,"PURPOSE To evaluate the relative effectiveness of the World Health Organization 2005 campaign (WHO-5) and other interventions to promote hand hygiene among healthcare workers in hospital settings and to summarize information on the use of resources. DESIGN Systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, NHS Economic Review Database, NHS Review and Dissemination Center, Cochrane Library and EPOC registry (December 2009 - February 2014)""; studies selected with the same search terms in previous systematic reviews (1980- 2009). REVIEW METHODS Included. The studies included were randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials, controlled pre-post trials, and discontinuous time series studies that implemented an intervention to improve hand hygiene compliance among healthcare workers in hospital settings and measured compliance or appropriate surrogates.The studies met predefined quality inclusion criteria. When not using analytical methods, primary data were reanalyzed. Random effects and network meta-analyses were performed in studies that reported direct observation of hand hygiene compliance, given that they were considered sufficiently homogeneous in terms of interventions, and participants did not understand information about the resources needed for the intervention. were removed and graded into three levels. RESULTS Of the 3639 studies collected, 41 met the inclusion criteria (six randomized controlled trials, 32 discontinuous time series, one nonrandomized study, and two controlled pre-post studies). A meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials showed that the addition of goal setting to the WHO-5 was associated with improved adherence (pooled odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.76; I(2)=81%). Of the 22 pairwise comparisons from interrupted time series, 18 showed incremental increases in hand hygiene compliance, and all but four tended to increase compliance after intervention. The network meta-analysis pointed to significant uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of interventions, but still provided evidence that WHO-5 is effective and that compliance can be further improved by adding interventions, including goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability. Nineteen studies reported clinical outcomes; data from these were consistent with clinically significant reductions in infection rates from improved hand hygiene for some, but not all, major nosocomial pathogens. Reported costs of interventions range from $225 to $4669 (146-£3035; “â€šâ¬204-â€šâ¬4229) per 1000 bed-days. CONCLUSION WHO-5 is effective in increasing adherence in healthcare workers. Goal setting, reward incentives and adding accountability strategies can lead to further improvement. Reporting of the resources required for such interventions is insufficient.",0,1,
411,Comparison of the cost effects of two quality strategies to improve test sequencing in primary care: a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the costs and cost reductions of an innovative strategy aimed at improving primary care physicians' test ordering routines compared to a traditional strategy. Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial with randomization at the local primary care physician group level. SETTING: Primary care: local groups of primary care physicians with diagnostic centers in five Dutch regions. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven existing local primary care physician groups, including 194 primary care physicians. INTERVENTION: The test sequencing strategy was systematically developed and combined feedback, training on guidelines, and small group quality improvement sessions. At regular quality meetings in local groups, primary care physicians discussed each other's testing behavior, linked it to guidelines, and made individual and/or group plans for change. Thirteen groups participated in all of the strategies (full response arm), while 14 groups received feedback only (feedback arm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Operating costs, development costs, and research costs were calculated every 6 months per primary care physician for response time. Average costs of tests ordered per primary care physician at 6 months were assessed at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS: The cost of the new strategy was 702.00 and the cost of the feedback strategy was 58.00. When operating costs were included only, the cost of the intervention was found to be 554.70 compared to 17.10 per primary care physician at 6 months in the feedback arm. Excluding opportunity costs for the time spent by doctors, the intervention was found to cost 92.70 per doctor at 6 months in the full intervention arm. The mean cost reduction achieved by physicians in this arm by reducing unnecessary testing was 144 greater per physician at 6 months than physicians in the feedback arm (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, including the expected non-monetary benefits, we propose more long-term impact and cost-effect studies on the implementation of the quality strategy.",0,1,
412,Comparison of staff effectiveness with home staff training in an intervention to improve hypertension management,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the resident physician can be as effective as the faculty opinion leader in changing physicians' compliance with the hypertension practice guideline. METHODS: Sequential charts were reviewed for patients with routinely occurring uncontrolled or new-onset hypertension over a two-week period at a general internal medicine clinic associated with the internal medicine residency program. Next, 23 providers were randomly assigned to an academic intervention to administer a hypertension practice guideline led by a single second-class resident instructor (RI), and 21 providers were assigned to the same intervention led by a single internist (SI). Interest in hypertension. The intervention included academic elaboration, graphic control with feedback, and behavior reinforcement. Six weeks later, the chart audit was repeated to assess the change in practice patterns among UR-taught providers compared with those taught by SI. RESULTS: Overall, management according to practice guidelines increased from 32% (51/157) to 45% (56/123) (p < .01) after intervention. This change was driven by the improvement in care from the SI-led intervention by service providers: 28% (17/60) to 57% (26/46) (p < .003). Providers of the UR-led intervention showed no improvement: 35% (34/97) to 39% (30/77) (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was effective in improving providers' compliance with a hypertension practice guideline, but only when administered by a faculty opinion leader. An assistant trainer using the same format was unable to change the behavior of the providers.",1,1,
413,Comparison of strategies to reduce rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in surgical patients: a controlled multicenter intervention trial.,"Objective To compare the impact of two strategies (improved hand hygiene versus methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening and decolonization) alone and in combination on MRSA rates in surgical wards. Design Prospective, controlled, interventional cohort study with 6-month baseline, 12-month intervention, and 6-month washout phases. It establishes 33 surgical services of 10 hospitals in nine countries in Europe and Israel. Participants All patients admitted to registered services for more than 24 hours. Interventions The two strategies compared were (1) promotion of improved hand hygiene and (2) universal MRSA screening with contact precautions and decolonization of MRSA carriers (intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine bath). Four hospitals were assigned to each intervention, and two hospitals combined both strategies using targeted MRSA screening. Outcome measures are monthly MRSA clinical culture rates per 100 susceptible patients (primary outcome) and MRSA infections per 100 referrals (secondary outcome). Planned subgroup analysis was performed for clean surgical wards. Results After adjusting for clustering and possible confounders, neither strategy was associated with significant changes in MRSA rates when used alone. Combining both strategies was associated with a 12% reduction per month in the proportion of MRSA clinical cultures (adjusted incidence rate rates (aIRR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98). In clean surgery wards, strategy 2 (MRSA screening, contact precautions, and decolonization) was used to identify MRSA clinical cultures (15% monthly reduction, aIRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97) and MRSA infections (17% monthly reduction, AIRR 0.83%, monthly). 95 CI 0.69 to 0.99). Conclusions In surgical wards with a relatively low prevalence of MRSA, a combination of improved standard and MRSA-specific infection control approaches was required to reduce MRSA rates. The application of single interventions was not effective except in clean surgery wards, where MRSA screening was associated with contact precautions and decolonization with significant reductions in MRSA clinical culture and infection rates.",0,1,

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Internet-based CME can produce changes in physician knowledge and behaviors that have an impact on patient care comparable to those produced through live, small-group, interactive CME. DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled trial conducted from August 2001 to July 2002. Participants were 97 primary care physicians selected from 21 practice sites in Houston, Texas, including 7 community health centers and 14 private group practices. A control group of 18 doctors from the same sites did not receive any intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomly assigned to either an Internet-based CME intervention that could be completed in multiple sessions over 2 weeks or a single live, small group, interactive CME workshop. Both included similarly versatile teaching approaches that have been shown to be effective in live environments. Content is based on the National Institutes of Health National Cholesterol Education Program--Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Information was evaluated immediately before, immediately after, and 12 weeks after intervention. Percentage of high-risk patients receiving appropriate lipid panel screening and pharmacotherapeutic treatment according to guidelines were documented by chart audits performed over a 5-month period prior to intervention and over a 5-month period post-intervention. RESULTS: Both interventions produced similar and significant immediate and 12-week knowledge gains, representing large increases in the percentage of correct items (pretest to posttest: 31.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 27.0-35.0%)""; 12 weeks: 36.4% [95% CI, 32.2%–40.6%]; P or = 93%), without significant post-intervention change. However, the Internet-based intervention was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of high-risk patients treated with pharmacotherapeutics according to guidelines (pre-intervention, 85.3%; post-intervention, 90.3%; “P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Properly designed, evidence-based online CME can produce objectively measured behavioral changes as well as sustained gains in knowledge comparable to or superior to those from effective live events.",1,1,

A few studies have evaluated the effect of sending reminders by mail, but few have compared alternative ways of reminding patients to receive the vaccine. In a randomized study of 939 patients aged 65 years and older in four family practice between October 23 and December 31, 1984, we compared three ways of reminding elderly patients of the vaccine: personal reminder by doctor, reminder by phone nurse, and reminder by letter. Vaccination rates for the three groups were 22.9%, 37% and 35.1%, respectively. No reminder was given to the control group and the rate was 9.8%. Some patients could not be reached by phone, and some did not see the doctor within the specified time. The rate of vaccination in patients with whom the nurse actually came into contact was 43.5%"";"" The proportion of patients the doctor actually saw was 45.1%. Overall, the nurse's phone reminder was the most effective, and with a salary of $16 an hour or less, it would also be the most cost-effective.

However, there are no reliable data on the spectrum and resistance of pathogens, the course of the disease, evidence-based treatment guidelines, and pathogen-host interactions. The German Ministry of Education and Research recognized these shortcomings and therefore decided to fund CAPNETZ, a competence network for community-acquired pneumonia. On the one hand, CAPNETZ integrates components of clinical and basic research (horizontal network) as well as health research and supports collaboration between GPs, community hospitals and universities (vertical network). Since October 2002, 1547 patients with CAP have been included in the network.

418,Complementary therapy in allergic rhinitis,"The term complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) refers to therapeutic and diagnostic approaches that differ from traditional allopathic medicine. CAM may encompass homeopathy, acupuncture, phytotherapy, antioxidant therapy, and numerous holistic or behavioral techniques. Allergists and physicians of all disciplines are confronted with patients using CAM treatments, making it imperative that they become familiar with the scientific literature surrounding them. Given the high prevalence of allergic diseases and the associated costs of CAM treatments, evidence of CAM treatments is needed to establish appropriate guidelines for their use. The efficacy of CAM modalities should be established by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including monitoring for adverse effects. Of all the CAM treatments studied to treat allergic rhinitis, some herbal therapies and antioxidants show a trend towards some clinical efficacy. Researchers have yet to determine how to integrate these CAM modalities into the overall treatment paradigm of allergic rhinitis.",0,0,
419,Complex pharmaceutical care intervention in pulmonary care: Part A. Process and professional satisfaction of pharmacists,"OBJECTIVE: In the IPMP study (Interventions to the Principle of Pulmonary Drug Profiles), specific pharmaceutical care interventions were provided to pulmonary patients selected for use of drugs different from the Dutch guidelines. The aim was to solve drug-related problems and improve patients' drug use. This article describes the pharmaceutical care process and describes the care package, tailored to the individual problems of patients in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: After preselection of patients with the aid of the algorithmic IPMP computing device, trained Dutch community pharmacists conducted structured consultations with patients in the intervention arm (ages 13-70) to identify behaviors and specific problems with their medication. Based on this identification process, a specific intervention was created that could include one or more of the six pharmaceutical care modules. The modules are clustered into clusters that describe the entire program of care provided to a patient. If necessary, pharmacists consulted patients' doctors to improve the prescribed treatment. After the interventions, drug changes were evaluated with the patients. The prescribed drug and refill rate were monitored on the pharmacy computer for 1 year.

421,The complexities of fall prevention in clinical settings: a review.,"Falls and related injuries and deaths are a growing concern among aging Americans. Effective fall risk management is a complex process that requires the participation of both healthcare professionals and older adults for three relevant actions: (a) early screening to identify risk factors; (b) prescribing personalized interventions; and (c) implementing compliance and the older adult's compliance with intervention. Early detection of fall risk can prevent future falls;"" however, uptake of evidence-based screening and evaluation protocols in the clinical setting has been limited. A variety of practice guidelines and financial incentives are available to healthcare professionals to facilitate adoption. However, there is a gap between recommended practices and current clinical activities. This review addresses the complexity of fall prevention practices and offers solutions that may facilitate their adoption by clinical practice. To this end, this review will present two models (ie, a clinical approach and a financial incentive approach) to summarize current clinical recommendations and practice guidelines for fall risk management in clinical settings. Various factors that encourage the adoption of evidence-based fall risk management strategies will be explained. In this context, we will discuss how an understanding of the different system-wide practice improvement initiatives and the driving factors in physician groups can facilitate clinician adoption and implementation of fall risk management behaviors. Additional efforts are needed to explore and evaluate similar initiatives to adopt and implement fall risk management practices at different points of entry into the system (eg, community settings, patients, caregivers).",0,0,
422,Compliance with biopsy recommendations of prostate cancer risk calculator,"UNLABELED: Study Type - Diagnosis (cohort) Level of Evidence 2b What is known about the topic? and What does the Work add? Few publications have so far shown that a predictive model influences the behavior of both physicians and patients. To the best of our knowledge, it was unknown whether urologists and patients followed the recommendations of the prostate cancer risk calculator and the reasons for non-compliance. The recommendations of the European Randomized Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator Screening study (ERSPC RC) regarding the necessity of prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. In most cases of non-compliance with the 'no biopsy' recommendations, a PSA level >/= 3 ng/mL was the determinant for selecting biopsy. Before the large scale implementation of ERSPC RC in urological practice, it is important to gain insight into the use of guidelines that might counter the adoption of RC use as a result of opposing recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate both urologist and patient compliance with the 'no biopsy' or 'biopsy' recommendation of the European Randomized Prostate Cancer Screening (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC) study and the reasons for their non-compliance. To evaluate the determinants of patient compliance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ERSPC RC calculates the probability of a positive sextant prostate biopsy (P(posb) ) using the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography results, and ultrasonographically evaluated prostate volume. If P(probability) >/=20%, biopsy was recommended. Between 2008 and 2011, eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals enrolled 443 patients (aged 55-75 years) after a non-biopsy PSA test. Urologists calculated P(posb) using RC in the presence of patients and filled out a compliance questionnaire. Patients completed a questionnaire about prostate cancer knowledge, attitude towards prostate biopsy, self-health assessment (12-item Short Form Health Questionnaire), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, Rated Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), and decision-making measures (Decision Conflict Scale). ). RESULTS: In 368 (83%) of 443 cases, both urologists and patients followed the RC recommendation. If biopsy was recommended, almost all patients (96%""; 257/269) complied, although 63 of 174 (36%) were biopsied against the recommendation of RC. mean P(probability) compared to those who did not (9% vs. 14%; P /= 3 ng/mL) (78%; 49/63) and patients because they wanted certainty (60%;"" 38/63).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the compliance of internal medicine residents with the latest National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) guidelines in the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Outpatient Clinic, Saint Vincent Hospital, Worcester, Massachusetts. PATIENTS: Patients with a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia who applied to the clinic during 1 ear period from December 2009 to November 2010. MEASUREMENTS: Medical records were reviewed to assess residents' compliance with NCEP-ATP III guidelines for LDL cholesterol. and management of non-HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy charts were reviewed. Only 212 (27.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data revealed better adherence to medication (44-77%) and therapeutic lifestyle changes (44-83%) compared with follow-up recommendations (22-31%). An increase in compliance was noted in all intervention areas when patients had an abnormal lipid profile. LIMITATIONS: Compliance has been evaluated only on the basis of electronic medical record documents and therefore we may be underestimating compliance with therapeutic lifestyle changes and follow-up recommendations. CONCLUSION: Compliance among internal medicine residents in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with hyperlipidemia according to NCEP-ATP III guidelines was insufficient and needs to be improved.",0,0,

427,Computer reminders for Chlamydia screening in general practice: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background: Reports of chlamydia are increasing in Australia, and the use of a computer alert that prompts general practitioners to test young women is a potential way to increase opportunistic chlamydia testing. The aim of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of a computer alert on testing for chlamydia in young women in general practice. Methods: In 2006, clinics in Melbourne, Australia (n = 68) were randomized into 2 groups: the intervention group received a computerized prompt advising the general practitioner to discuss testing for chlamydia with their patients. - Opened to 24-year-old woman""; no warning was given to the control group.

428,Computer reminders to implement preventive care guidelines for hospitalized patients.,"Background: Hospitalizations are an opportunity to provide preventive care. Purpose: To determine whether computer reminders, which we have shown to be effective in our outpatient care setting, increase inpatient preventive care delivery. Methods: Randomized, controlled study in the general medicine inpatient ward of an urban, university-affiliated public hospital. Study subjects were 78 household staff members returning in 6 general medical services. The intervention was reminders to physicians about the preventative care their patients were eligible for, printed in daily reports, and preventive care recommendations delivered via physicians' workstations. Preventive maintenance guidelines are derived from US Preventive Maintenance Task Force recommendations. Compliance with preventive care guidelines and attitude of household staff towards providing preventive care to hospitalized patients were the main outcome measures. Results: There was no significant difference in adherence to preventive care guidelines between intervention and control physicians when collective or individual preventive care actions were analyzed. This was true even though most doctors approve of providing most types of preventive care for hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Despite past success in increasing preventive care in the outpatient setting, we were unable to increase preventive care delivery during hospitalizations using a moderately intensive intervention. The fact that the physicians who provide care during hospitalization are not the primary care physicians of the patients constitutes an important obstacle. Overcoming this resistance may require more intensive interventions or more direct links between inpatient and outpatient providers. Arch Intern Med. 1996"";""156:1551-1556",0,1,

Benefit-framed messages (that is, messages that emphasize the benefits of hand hygiene rather than the risks of non-compliance) may be most effective, but have not been tested. Methods The study was conducted in a 27-bed neonatal intensive care unit. We performed a discontinuous time series analysis of objectively measured hand disinfection events. We used electronic devices in hand alcohol dispensers that consistently document the frequency of hand disinfection events. In addition, compliance with hand hygiene was directly observed before and after the intervention. Results The negative trend in hand hygiene events per patient-day before intervention (2.3 [standard error, 0.5] decrease per week) changed to a significant positive trend (1.5 [0.5] increase per week) after intervention (P < . 001). Direct observations confirmed these results by showing a significant improvement in hand hygiene adherence in 193 (63.6%) of 303 hand hygiene events observed in the pretest, from 281 to 201 (71.5%) in the posttest. Conclusions We concluded that hand hygiene related achievement framed messages presented in screen savers can improve hand hygiene compliance.",1,1,
430,Computer-managed clinical rating scales. a review,"Although clinician-administered symptom rating scales are the most commonly used outcome measures in pharmaceutical research, the error variance due to poor inter-rater reliability increases the risk of type II errors in multicenter clinical trials. Such error variance may obscure real differences between the active drug and placebo or between the two comparator compounds. Computer-managed versions of symptom rating scales, originally designed to be administered by trained clinicians, offer a solution to this problem. This article reviews empirical data on the reliability, validity, and equivalence of computer-managed rating scales. Computerized versions of clinician-administered scales are now available for the assessment of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. Validation studies support the reliability, validity and equivalence of these scales. The patients' response was positive; patients often prefer the computer more honestly and often to assess sensitive areas such as suicide, alcohol or drug use, sexual behavior or HIV-related symptoms. Applications using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology facilitate longitudinal monitoring of patients without requiring office visits to collect data, increasing the availability of information to the clinician and the quality of patient care through more informed decision making. Computers, when used in accordance with established ethical guidelines, offer a reliable, inexpensive, accessible and time-efficient way to assess psychiatric symptoms.",0,0,
431,Computer-based decision support for pediatric asthma management: definition and applicability of the Stop Asthma Clinical System.,"Clinical guidelines can be helpful in the management of asthma. Decision support systems (DDSs) may increase adherence to clinical guidelines, but do not tend to provide clinicians with clues for behavior change strategies to promote patient self-management. The Stop Asthma Clinical System (SACS) is a KDS designed for this purpose. To assess feasibility, seven clinicians used SACS to guide well visits of 26 pediatric asthma patients who were predominantly persistent. Data were collected through questionnaires and in-depth semi-structured interviews. SACS improved assessment of asthma severity and control, classification and intervention in medicine, and environmental trigger management problems and development of an action plan (all p < 0.05). Improved clinician-patient communication. The primary challenge was that SACS increased clinical visit time. SACS may improve clinician behavior to improve patient self-management of asthma, but further studies are indicated to alleviate temporal constraints and assess impact on clinician and patient communication and behavior and clinical outcomes.",0,0,
432,Computerized clinical decision support during drug ordering for long-term care residents with renal impairment.,"Objective: To determine whether a computerized clinical decision support system that provides patient-specific recommendations in real time improves prescribing quality for long-term care residents with renal failure. Design: Randomized trial in long-term accommodation of a large long-term care facility. Randomization was in blocks by unit type. Warnings regarding drug prescription for residents with renal failure were shown to prescribers in intervention units and confidential but followed up in control units. Measurement: The proportions of final drug orders eligible were compared between intervention and control units within the alert categories: (1) recommended drug doses""; (2) recommended administration frequencies; (3) drug avoidance recommendations; (4) warnings Results: Intervention and control The alert rates in the intervention units were almost equal: 2.5 per 1,000 established days in the intervention units and 2.4 in the control units. Significantly higher final drug ordering rates were appropriate in intervention units for the categories: relative risk 2.4 (1.4, 4.4) for maximum frequency; 2.6 for drugs to be avoided (1.4, 5.0);"" and 1.8 for warnings to get missing information (1.1, 3.4). Overall, final drug orders were available significantly more frequently in response units – relative risk 1.2 (1.0, 1.4). Conclusions: Clinical decision support for physicians prescribing medication for long-term care residents with renal impairment may improve the quality of prescribing decisions.",1,1,
433,Computed ensemble cholesterol control (4C): overcoming the secondary prevention challenge.,"Background: Dyslipidemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease. Computer-Based Clinical Decision Support System provides an opportunity to close these gaps. Objectives: To examine the effect of computerized intervention on secondary prevention of CAD[1]. Methods: CDSS[2] is programmed to automatically detect patients with CAD and evaluate the availability of an updated lipoprotein profile and treatment with lipid-lowering drugs. The program produced computer-generated automated monitoring and treatment recommendations. Adjusted primary clinics were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=56) or standard care arms (n=56). Reminders updated with current lipid levels and further treatment recommendations were mailed every 4 months to primary healthcare teams in the intervention arm. Compliance and lipid levels were monitored. The study group included all CAD patients alive at least 3 months after hospitalization. Results: Follow-up was available for 7448 patients with CAD (median 19.8 months, range 6-36 months). Overall, 51.7% of patients were adequately screened and 55.7% of patients were compliant with the recommended treatment for lipid lowering. A significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein levels was observed in both arms, but more pronounced in the intervention arm: 124.3 Â± 34.6 mg/dl (P < 0.02) versus 121.9 Â± 34.2. A significantly lower cardiac rehospitalization rate of 37% versus 40.9% (P < 0.001) was documented in patients adequately treated with lipid-lowering drugs. Conclusions: This initial evaluation of our data represents a real-world snapshot in which physicians and patients with CAD often fail to follow clinical guidelines and represent a major barrier to the implementation of effective secondary prevention. Our automatic computerized reminder system greatly simplifies compliance and supports extensive implementation.",0,1,
434,Computerized decision support based on clinical practice guidelines improves compliance with standards of care,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical guidelines are designed to assist in the management of specific diseases""; however, these guidelines are often neglected in the delivery of care. At the patient visit, a decision support based on a practice guideline that creates a customized management protocol for the individual patient using data from the patient's electronic medical records. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a 6-month controlled trial in primary care, 58 primary care clinicians were randomized to receive either a custom encounter form or a standardized encounter form with computer-generated guideline recommendations. Impact of computer-generated advice on clinician behavior, adherence to guideline recommendations 30 clinicians were analysed; Data from 28 clinicians were excluded as these clinicians did not meet predefined criteria for minimum exposure to diabetic patient care. RESULTS: Availability of patient management recommendations generated by the decision support system resulted in a twofold increase in clinician adherence to diabetes mellitus care guidelines (P = 0.01). The median agreement for the group receiving the recommendations was 32.0%, while it was 15.6% for the control group. CONCLUSION: Decision support based on a clinical practice guideline is an effective tool to assist clinicians in the management of diabetic patients. This decision support system provides a model for how a clinical practice guideline can be integrated into the care process by computer to help clinicians manage a particular disease by helping them adhere to standards of care. The use of decision support systems based on clinical practice guidelines can ultimately improve the quality of medical care.",0,1,
435,Computerized decision support for drug dosing in renal failure: a randomized controlled trial.,"Purpose of study Emergency room physicians prescribe several discharge medications that require dosage adjustments for patients with kidney disease. The hypothesis of this research was that decision support in a computerized physician order entry system would reduce the rate of drug overdose in patients with kidney failure. Methods This was a randomized, controlled trial in an academic emergency room (ED) where computerized physician order entry was used to write all prescriptions for patients discharged from the emergency room. The sample consisted of 42 physicians randomized to the intervention (21 physicians) or control (21 physicians) groups. The intervention was decision support that provided dose recommendations for drugs targeted for patients 18 years of age and older when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance level was below the dosage adjustment threshold. The primary outcome was the proportion of targeted drugs overdosed. Results For 2,783 (46%) of 6,015 patient visits, decision support had sufficient information to predict the patient's creatinine clearance level. The mean age of these patients was 46 years, 1,768 (64%) women, and 1,523 (55%) blacks. Physicians in the intervention group who overdosed 31 (43%) prescriptions were given decision support 73 times. By comparison, control physicians overdosed a significantly greater proportion of drugs: 34/46, 74% (effect size=31%; 95% confidence interval 14% to 49%; P=.001). Computerized physician order entry with decision support significantly reduced overdose of targeted drugs.",1,1,
436,Computerized decision support to reduce possible inappropriate prescribing to elderly emergency room patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of computer-assisted decision support in reducing potentially inappropriate prescribing to older adults. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: An academic emergency department (ED) in Indianapolis, Indiana, where computerized physician order entry is used to write all medication prescriptions. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three emergency physicians were randomized into the intervention (32 physicians) or control (31 physicians) groups. INTERVENTION: Decision support advising against the use of nine potentially unsuitable drugs and recommending safer substitution treatments. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of emergency room visits by the elderly that resulted in one or more prescriptions for an inappropriate medication. The main secondary outcomes were rates of inappropriately prescribed drugs and reasons why intervention physicians refused decision support. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 74 years, two-thirds were women, and just over half were African American. 114 decision support was given to intervention physicians who accepted 49 (43%) of the recommendations. Intervention doctors prescribed one or more inappropriate medications during 2.6% of emergency room visits by the elderly, compared with 3.9% of visits led by control doctors (P=.02;"" odds ratio=0.55, 95% confidence interval=0.34–0.89) The proportion of all drugs prescribed inappropriately decreased significantly from 5.4% to 3.4%. The most common reason for refusing decision support was that the patient had no previous drug-related problems. CONCLUSION: Decision-assisted computerized physician order entry has significantly decreased prescribing potentially unsuitable drugs for the elderly. This approach can be used in other efforts to improve emergency room care. Trial Record: Clinical trial.gov Identifier: NCT00297869.",1,1,

441,Consensus on stereotactic neurosurgery guidelines for psychiatric disorders,"BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical procedures may be considered for patients with psychiatric disorders who do not respond to 'standard' treatments. Guidelines for the safe and ethical conduct of such procedures have been proposed previously and independently by various local and regional expert groups. METHODS: To expand on these legacy documents, representative members of the continental and international associations of psychiatry and neurosurgery have joined efforts to further refine and adopt a worldwide set of pragmatic guidelines. They address a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, brain targets and neurosurgical techniques, taking into account the cultural and social heterogeneities of healthcare settings. RESULTS: The proposed consensus document highlights that although stereotactic ablative procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder are considered 'established' in some countries, they still lack level I evidence. It is also noted that deep brain stimulation is still in the research phase in any brain target ever tried and for any psychiatric or behavioral disorder. Researchers are encouraged to design randomized controlled trials based on scientific and data-driven rationales for disease and brain target selection. Experienced multidisciplinary teams are a mandatory requirement for the safe and ethical conduct of any psychiatric neurosurgery, ensuring documented patients' refractoriness, appropriate consent procedures that respect the patient's capacity and autonomy, versatile pre- and post-operative long-term follow-up evaluation and reporting. effects and side effects for all patients.

PARTICIPANTS: 4 members of the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety were James C. Ballenger (chairman), Jonathan RT Davidson, Yves Lecrubier and David J. Nutt. Four faculty members invited by the President also attended: David S. Baldwin, Johan A. den Boer, Siegfried Kasper, and M. Katherine Shear. EVIDENCE: Consensus statement is based on 6 review articles published in this appendix and the scientific literature on these topics. ACCOUNTING PROCESS: Group meetings were held for 2 days. On day 1, the group discussed each review document and the chair and debater (Dr. Kasper) identified key issues for further discussion. On day 2, the group discussed these important issues to reach a consensus. After the group meetings, the consensus statement was drafted by the chairman and approved by all participants. RESULTS: The consensus statement provides standard definitions for response and remission and defines the appropriate strategy for the management of panic disorder in a primary care setting. Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors are recommended as first-choice drugs with a treatment period of 12 to 24 months. Medication should be discontinued gradually over a period of 4 to 6 months.",0,0,
443,Resource conservation theory and research use in health systems,"Background Health systems face challenges in using research evidence to improve policy and practice. These challenges are particularly evident in small and under-resourced health systems, which are located in areas with poorer health (in Canada and globally). Organizational resources have not been the focus of knowledge translation (KT) research, although research use has been recognized as important in understanding resource theories. What resources are generally required for KT and how does their presence or absence affect research use? In this paper, we consider conservation of resources (COR) theory as a theoretical foundation for understanding the capacity to use research evidence in health systems. Three components of COR theory are studied in the context of KT. First, resources are required for research recruitment. Second, the threat of resource loss encourages resistance to research use. Third, resources can be optimized even in resource-poor environments to build capacity for PI. Methods A review of the KT literature examined the institutional resources required for research use. The multiple case study approach examined the three components of COR theory outlined above. The multi-case study consisted of a document review and key informative interviews with research team members, including government decision makers and health practitioners, through a retrospective analysis of four applied health research studies conducted in a resource-poor region. Results The literature review identified institutional sources that influence research use. The multiple case study supported these findings, contributed to the development of a classification of institutional resources, and revealed how fears about loss of resources may affect research use. Some resources were found to make up for other resource vulnerabilities. Resource needs differed at various stages in the research use process. Conclusions COR theory contributes to understanding the role of resources in research use, resistance to research use, and potential strategies for improving research use. Resources (and lack thereof) may explain the observed differences in research uptake across health systems. This article provides a theoretical foundation to guide further examination of COR-KT ideas and provides support for research use in resource-constrained environments.",0,0,
444,Consultation training of nurses for cardiovascular prevention - a 2-year randomized trial,"The aim of this study is to increase the compliance of patients to hypertension treatment with consultation training of nurses. Thirty-three nurses were included in the study. In the intervention group (IG), 19 nurses attended a 3-day residential training course on the Stages of Change model, Motivational Interviewing and cardiovascular prevention guidelines and recruited 153 patients. Sixteen nurses in the control group (KG) recruited 59 patients. A reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was noticed in both groups over 2 years. Heart rate (p = 0.027), body mass index (p = 0.019), weight (p = 0.0001), waist (p = 0.041), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p = 0.0001), waist-to-hip ratio (p = 0.024) ) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) were greatly reduced in IG only. After 2 years, 52.6% (p = 0.13) of patients on IG achieved the </= 140/90 mmHg target in blood pressure and 39.2% in CG. There was a significant (p = 0.021) difference between the groups for self-reported physical activity. The beneficial effects of consultation training on the proportion of patients achieving weight parameters, physical activity, perceived stress and blood pressure control highlight consultation training and the use of behavioral models to motivate patients to adhere to treatment.",0,0,
445,Consumer satisfaction among patients and GPs in involving specialist nurses in primary care for patients with urinary incontinence,"BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common problem, but current guidelines on UI are not followed. To align care with guidelines, we planned an intervention to involve nurses specializing in UI in primary care and evaluated it in a randomized controlled trial. Alongside this intervention, we evaluated consumer satisfaction among patients and general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: Patients' satisfaction with care provided by specialist nurses (intervention group) or general practitioners (control group), respectively, was measured with a self-filled questionnaire. GPs' views on the involvement of specialist nurses were measured in a structured telephone interview. RESULTS: The patient satisfaction score for care delivered by specialist nurses was 8.4 (scale 1-10) versus 6.7 for care as usual by GPs. More than 85% of patients recommend specialist nurse care to their closest friends, and 77% of general practitioners thought the role of specialist nurse was beneficial and gave an average score of 7.2. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample is relatively small and the stability of results is only tentatively determined, the substitution of UI care from GP to specialist nurse is welcomed by both patients and GPs. Small changes, such as adding additional user interface-specific information and placing more emphasis on the user interface (which had previously received little attention), would provide a simple tool to encourage patients to change their behavior in the right direction.",0,0,

447,Contemporary perspectives on tobacco cessation: what oncologists need to know,"Over the past 5 years there has been a tremendous increase in smoking cessation research, largely spurred by the publication of the 1996 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Tobacco Use and Addiction Treatment. These federal guidelines, published by the Agency for Health Policy and Research, provided extensive empirical evidence that tobacco cessation interventions were effective and encouraged routine practice in medical settings. Since then, numerous studies of tobacco cessation have increased the knowledge of successful smoking intervention methods. Unfortunately, about a third of cancer-related deaths continue to be attributed to smoking behaviors. It is imperative that healthcare providers, patients, and family members encourage and participate in smoking cessation efforts. This article provides a review of the current literature on smoking cessation and describes proven first-line treatments for tobacco cessation. Clinicians are encouraged to screen for tobacco use on an ongoing basis and to provide brief interventions that utilize behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy to treat their patients' tobacco addiction.",0,0,

Methods: Participants participated in an initial phase, a subsequent intervention phase consisting of three exercise sessions per week for 4 weeks, and a follow-up session 2 weeks after the intervention. A total of $145 was available for attendance and exercise contingency payments. Results: The results show that all participants significantly increased exercise during the intervention, from initial inactivity to performing three 30-minute sessions per week. Participants made some gains during follow-up. Limitations: The study used a small and homogeneous sample size and required participants to exercise in a laboratory setting, thus limiting external validity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that incentive-based interventions are an effective and viable way to promote exercise. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,
449,Continuation of driving habits of patients diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the driving behavior of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and their impact on diagnosis, treatment, legal guidelines and recommendations. DESIGN: Inventory based on surveys. SETTING: Center for Sleep and Waking Disorders, The Hague, The Netherlands. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all EDS patients who were stable for at least 6 months after treatment (n = 138). Questions concerned actual driving behaviour, EDS and the implications of diagnosis, therapy and advice given by the Centre. RESULTS: The response was 67% (n = 92). Eighteen patients had never driven. Of the other 74 patients, 18 stopped driving or drove less. Fifty-six patients did not change their behavior or last longer. Diagnosis, therapy, and advice to stop driving had little effect on driving behavior. CONCLUSION: Patients with EDS often participate in modern traffic as drivers. Legal guidelines and advice given by physicians have little effect on this behavior. Individual patient-specific approaches may lead to more acceptable outcomes, as general measures appear to be ineffective.",0,0,

Subjects: 3373 children aged 1-15 years with asthma or symptoms suggestive of probable asthma from a systematic review of 10 725 general practice case records. Intervention: Children were targeted for a clinical examination by their general practitioner or practice nurse. Main outcome measures: Asthma-related consultations, prescriptions, hospital admission, and healthcare costs 12 months before and after the study. Results: Compared with controls (n=1563), the intervention group (n=1585) had asthma (relative risk 2.18 (95% CI 1.74 to 2.73), new asthma diagnoses (2.83 (2.26). to 3.54))) and previous diagnoses were reconfirmed (1.30 (1.08 to 1.58)) and inhaled cromoglycate was prescribed more frequently (1.52 (1.02 to 2.25)). Inpatient-day rates decreased from 152 to 122 in the intervention group and increased from 69 to 117 in the control group between the year before and after the study. Total primary care costs increased from £30118 to £37243 in the intervention group, while they decreased from £29131 to £27990 in the control group. The cost of hospital care decreased from £25406 to £20727 in the intervention group and increased from £12699 to £19650 in the control group. Conclusion: A control facilitator can positively affect the diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma in general practice. This can have an impact on healthcare costs.",0,1,

Data on the quality of interaction between physicians practicing occupational dermatology and OHI are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted with 854 German members of the Occupational and Environmental Dermatology Working Group in October 2013. Items included demographic data, a judgment on cooperation between dermatologists and OHI companies, and an economic rating of available compensation. scheme and prioritization of optimization tasks. RESULTS: 182 members (21.3% of the invited population) participated in the survey. Cooperation with OHI companies was evaluated as ""very good"" by 10.8 percent, ""good"" by 56.7 percent, ""sufficient"" by 24.2 percent, ""sufficient"" by 7.0 percent and ""inadequate"" by 1.3 percent. 93.4% of the interviewees mentioned the problems and improvement potentials in their own practice or clinics and in cooperation with OHS companies. The main points of criticism were reimbursement (44.7%), subsequent deterioration of treatment options (36.5%) and delay or extent of treatment in the dermatologist's procedure (29.4%). CONCLUSIONS: While most physicians practicing occupational dermatology have a positive judgment of cooperation with OHI companies, there is potential for quality optimization in time-intensive consultation in reimbursement of dermatological services, particularly in occupational skin disease prevention, diagnosis and activation of treatment.

453,Key outcome measures for laboratory evaluation studies of human opioid abuse liability: IMMPACT recommendations,"critical component in the development of opioid analgesics is the assessment of liability for abuse (AL). Standardization of approaches and measures used to evaluate AL has the potential to facilitate comparisons between studies, research laboratories, and drugs. The purpose of this report is to provide consensus recommendations on key outcome measures for assessing the abuse potential of opioid drugs in humans in a controlled laboratory setting. While most of the proposed measures are appropriate for assessing AL of drugs from other drug classes, the focus here is on opioid drugs because they present unique risks to both physiological (e.g. respiratory depression, physical dependence) and public health (e.g. individuals) risks. in pain) perspectives. A brief historical perspective on AL testing is provided, and then these measures, which may be considered primary and secondary outcomes and possible additional outcomes in AL assessment, are discussed.

Providers' perspectives,"Background: Although primary care physicians understand the importance of preventive services for patients with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (MRF), physician intervention is limited. This study included (1) physicians' views on the difficulties they face in managing patients with MRF; (2) the counseling and management methods they use, and (3) possible strategies to improve MRF intervention in the primary care setting. METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted with primary care physicians from a variety of settings to gain insight into these above-mentioned issues. Each group was assisted by a physician and a behavioral scientist using a semi-structured interview guide previously developed. Group discussions were tape-recorded and then transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using the continuous comparative method for analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians, knowledge limitations (individual risk factors contribute to overall risk), limited support (guidelines, materials, and staff);"" and logistical challenges (organizational issues, time constraints). tends to be highly individualized, with an initial preference for change interventions. Physicians preferred a serial approach rather than a parallel approach to MRF intervention, starting with the patient's perceived behaviors as primary. Suggested solutions to current challenges include physician education and the development of innovative approaches that include physician assistance and a team approach. CONCLUSION: Physicians are aware and sensitive of the complexity of MRF management for their patients and themselves, however, future MRF interventions will require the involvement of non-physician personnel and enhanced systems support.",0,0,
455,"Coronary risk factor management in primary practice in Shibuya, Tokyo","OBJECTIVE: Many large-scale clinical studies have confirmed that coronary risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus predict a higher incidence of cardiovascular events and that control of these risk factors reduces the incidence. However, the actual management of such risk factors and the resulting improvement of cardiovascular events in primary practice remains unclear. Heart Care Network Shibuya, a volunteer working group of regional primary physicians, explored the management of coronary risk factors and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 209 outpatients (mean age 65.6 +/- 11.2 years) with multiple hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus or previous myocardial infarction, behavioral patterns of coronary risk factor in management were investigated and changes in risk factors were investigated. 1 year. RESULTS: Anti-hypertensive (1.3 +/- 0.8 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 drugs per patient) and antihyperlipidemia drugs (0.70 +/- 0.4 to 0.73 +/ patient per patient) - 0.4 drugs) did not increase significantly. Patient education increased significantly after 1 year for diet (93% vs. 97%, p = 0.077), exercise (69% vs. 81%, p < 0.05), and non-smoking (66% vs 86%, p < 0.05). Blood pressure 142 +/- 16/81 +/- 10 to 138 +/- 78/78 +/- 9 mmHg (p < 0.05), serum total cholesterol level 215 +/- 39 to 203 + /- decreased 39 mg/dl (p < 0.05). As a result, more patients achieved the treatment goals recommended by the Japanese Hypertension Society (34.6% to 46.8%) and the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (40.2% to 49.5%) guidelines. However, none of the blood hemoglobin A1c level, body mass index, or smokers changed significantly. RESULTS: Regional practitioners attempted to control all coronary risk factors. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which were relatively dependent on medical treatment, resolved. In contrast, there was no improvement in diabetes mellitus, obesity, or smoking, which required lifestyle changes. The main issue in risk factor management is how physicians behave rather than specific actions.",0,0,
456,Cost implications of implementing an electronic decision support system to order laboratory tests in primary care: evidence from a controlled prospective study in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: The economic implications of interventions to promote the rational, evidence-based use of laboratory testing by physicians are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the cost implications of a computer-based, guideline-based decision support system (CDSS) for ordering blood tests in primary care. METHODS: We established the CDSS in 118 practices [159 general practitioners (GPs)] across the Netherlands and calculated the costs of intervention in this group. Test-ordering behavior of 87 (109 GPs) of these 118 study applications, 6 months before and during the 6-month period of CDSS installation, was examined and the results compared with those of a non-historical control group with no application. CDSS. In addition, the costs of laboratory demands were calculated for both groups. RESULTS: Total intervention costs, consisting of development costs and installation costs, reached €79,000 (670 € per application). While the introduction of CDSS did not affect the number of order forms sent to laboratories, it reduced the number of blood tests per order form. As a result, CDSS achieved an average savings in costs of laboratory requests of 847 euros per application in 6 months. CONCLUSION: This study shows that providing electronic decision support for blood test request in primary care is an economically promising concept. Savings in laboratory costs can be achieved and are not offset by disproportionately high intervention costs.",1,1,
457,Cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system based on recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for the management of hypercholesterolemia: report of a cluster randomized trial.,"Introduction and objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology and other societies (ESCHM) for the Management of Hypercholesterolemia. Study design and perspective A randomized, unblinded, pragmatic trial was conducted. To assess the impact on efficacy and costs of a CDSS implementing an adapted version of the ESCHM recommendations, a parallel comparison with a regular care group for 1 year was performed. The recruitment process, which started in April 2000, ended after 1 year. Efficacy was defined as achieving low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction targets in patients with an initial cardiovascular risk (CVR) >20% at 10 years (targets for patients LDL-C <115 mg/dL). to maintain CVR <20% at study end in patients with LDL-C <130 mg/dL) or baseline CVR <20% for patients with or without coronary heart disease [CHD]. The costs of treatments, visits and laboratory evaluations have been socially estimated (cost year 2002). Methods ESCHM guidelines, adapted by a steering committee, included therapeutic recommendations for achieving LDL-C targets cost-effectively. Items such as tablecloths and magnets for the refrigerator (with associated promotional messages) were distributed to intervention practices to promote healthy cardiovascular lifestyles. All study doctors saved patients' data in a special-purpose application that was loaded onto their computers. In the case of intervention physicians, CDSS was established as an additional module of this practice and they were asked to use it, but were otherwise free to accept or ignore the recommendations. Compliance with the guideline was monitored by CDSS. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were selected from 44 general practices in Spain, particularly in the Catalonia region. Major outcome measures and outcomes included 2221 patients (1161 in the usual care group and 1060 in the intervention group). The intervention was shown to be as effective as usual care in both an unadjusted analysis and after adjusting for absolute CVR and prior treatment with lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% CI 0.58, 1.77]. The intervention had no effect on lipid profiles. Intervention patients were prescribed LLD less frequently than usual care patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.26, 0.52;"" p = 0.0001), particularly when CVR was low, resulting in significant savings in treatments (p = 0.0001) and overall costs ( p = 0.001) were estimated at 24.9% and 20.8%, respectively. Intervention increased the number of laboratory analyses. Recommendations given by the CDSS were accepted in 71.3% of visits. Discussion and Conclusions CDSS ESCHM based on recommendations, improved routine care did not change its effectiveness, but significantly saved.",0,1,
458,Cost-effectiveness of a manual-based coping strategy program in improving the mental health of family caregivers of people with dementia (START (STrAtegies for RelaTives) study): a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the START-UP (STRATEGIES for Relatives) intervention as usual added to treatment is cost-effective compared to usual treatment alone. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis takes place in a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Three mental health and one neurological outpatient dementia services in London and Essex, UK. PARTICIPANTS Family caregivers of people with dementia. INTERVENTION An eight-session, manual-based, coping intervention provided by supervised psychology graduates to family caregivers of people with dementia added to usual treatment compared to usual treatment alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Costs measured from a health and social care perspective were analyzed along with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score (HADS-T) of affective symptoms and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in cost-effectiveness analyzes from baseline for eight months. RESULTS Of the 260 study participants, 173 were randomized to the START intervention and 87 to the usual treatment alone. Mean HADS-T scores were lower in the intervention group than in the usual treatment group over the 8-month evaluation period (mean difference -1.79 (95% CI -3.32 to -0.33)), indicating better outcomes associated with the START intervention. There was a small improvement in health-related quality of life as measured by QALYs (0.03 (-0.01 to 0.08)). Costs were not different between the intervention and usual treatment groups (£252 (-28 to 565 higher for the START group). Cost-effectiveness calculations show that START has a better chance of being cost-effective compared to usual treatment alone at a payment threshold of €30,000 per QALY earned. demonstrated greater than 99% and a high probability of cost-effectiveness over HADS- Measure T. RESULTS The manual-based coping intervention START, when added to treatment as usual, had both outcome measures (emotional symptoms for family caregivers and caregiver-based QALY' s) was cost-effective compared to usual treatment alone, with reference to TRIAL REGISTRATION ISCTRN 70017938.",0,0,
459,Cost-effectiveness of strategies to combat neuropsychiatric conditions in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia: a mathematical modeling study.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the comparative costs and effects of interventions to combat five neuropsychiatric conditions (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, epilepsy and heavy alcohol use). DESIGN Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. ENVIRONMENT Two epidemiologically defined subregions of the world: countries with very high adult and high child mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa (AfrE) and countries with high adult and high child mortality rates in Southeast Asia (SearD). DATA SOURCES Published studies , cost databases MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per capita and cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) avoided, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for 2005. , cost-effectiveness values differed by two orders of magnitude (for a healthy life year gained Int100-250 to Int10,000-25,000) In both subregions, inpatient treatment of schizophrenia with newer antipsychotic drugs was the most costly and least costly strategy Most cost-effective strategies for population-based alcohol control in the African subregion, while in the South East Asian subregion The most cost-effective intervention in the region was drug treatment of epilepsy in primary care. The cumulative cost per person of the cost-effective intervention set was estimated to be $4.90-5.70. This package includes interventions for epilepsy (former first-line antiepileptic drugs); depression (newer antidepressants and psychosocial therapy generally produced); bipolar disorder (the mood stabilizer drug lithium); schizophrenia (neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs and psychosocial treatment) and heavy alcohol use (increased taxation and enforcement, reduced access and advertising bans in the African subregion and brief advice to heavy drinkers in primary care). Resources for cost-effective intervention strategies will increase health gain, save money, and help expand much-needed services for neuropsychiatric conditions in low-resource settings.",0,0,
460,Cost-effectiveness of strategies to combat vision and hearing loss in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia: a mathematical modeling study,"OBJECTIVE To determine the relative costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness of selected interventions to control cataracts, trachoma, refractive errors, hearing loss, meningitis, and chronic otitis media. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis or combined strategies to control vision and hearing loss through a lifetime population model. DETERMINATION Two World Health Organization subregions of the world where vision and hearing loss are the major burden: Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. DATA SOURCES Biological and behavioral parameters from clinical and observational studies and population-based studies. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Disability adjusted cost per life year (DALY) avoided, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for 2005. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of chronic otitis media, extracapsular cataract surgery, trichiasis surgery, treatment of meningitis, and annual screening of school-aged children for refractive error are among the most cost-effective interventions to control hearing and vision impairment, preventing cost <$Int285 per DALY in both regions. Screening both school-aged children (yearly) and adults (every five years) for hearing loss avoided hearing loss costs of approximately $1,000 per DALY. These interventions can be considered highly cost effective. Mass treatment with azithromycin to control trachoma may be considered cost-effective in Africa, but not in the South East Asian subregion. CONCLUSIONS Vision and hearing impairment control interventions are generally cost-effective. To decide whether substantial investment in these interventions is warranted, this finding must be evaluated in relation to the economic attractiveness of other existing or new interventions in health.",0,0,
461,Cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based intervention (AIMS) to improve adherence among HIV-infected patients: design of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Background Non-adherence to HIV therapy can have a negative impact on patients' treatment success rates, quality of life, contagiousness, and life expectancy. Several compliance interventions have shown positive effects on compliance and/or virological outcomes. The theory and evidence-based Adherence Improvement Self-Management Strategy (AIMS) is an intervention shown in a randomized controlled trial to improve rates of adherence and viral suppression. However, evidence for cost-effectiveness is lacking. Following a recent review that suggested that cost-effectiveness assessments of compliance interventions for chronic diseases are rare and that the methodology for such assessments is not adequately described in the literature, this article presents the study protocol for a multicenter study evaluating efficacy and cost. -efficacy of AIMS among a heterogeneous patient sample. Methods/design The study uses a multicenter randomized controlled trial design to compare AIMS intervention with usual care from a societal perspective. This RCT includes an empirical and model-based economic assessment. A planned number of 230 HIV-infected patients were randomized to either AIMS or usual care. Relevant outcomes include changes in compliance, plasma viral load, quality of life, and community costs. The time horizon for empirical economic evaluation is 12-15 months. Costs and impacts are estimated over a lifetime horizon for model-based economic assessment. Discussion The current multicenter RCT is designed to provide robust methodological evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based counseling intervention (AIMS) to support treatment adherence in a large and heterogeneous sample of HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands. The purpose of the present article is to describe the trial protocol in sufficient detail to allow the quality of the study design to be fully evaluated. If proven to be cost-effective, it is anticipated that AIMS could contribute to improved evidence-based counseling guidelines for HIV nurses and other healthcare professionals.",0,1,
462,Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the initial medical management of acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation: systematic review and decision-analytical modeling.,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and prioritize key areas of clinical uncertainty regarding the medical management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in current UK practice. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Consultations with clinical consultants. Postal survey of cardiologists. REVIEW METHODS: Potential areas with significant uncertainty were identified and 'decision issues' were prioritized. A systematic literature review was performed using standard methods. The decision model created consisted of a short-term phase applying the results of the systematic review and a long-term phase incorporating relevant information from an observational study in the UK to estimate estimated costs and effects. Sensitivity analyzes were performed to examine the dependence of the results on the main parameters using alternative data sources. The expected value of information analysis is performed to estimate the expected value of perfect information associated with the decision problem. This provided an upper bound on the monetary value associated with additional research in the area. RESULTS: Seven current areas of clinical uncertainty (decision problems) were identified in the drug treatment of patients with unstable angina. The agents involved were clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, hirudin, and intravenous glycoprotein antagonists (GPAs). Twelve published clinical guidelines for unstable angina or ACS without ST elevation were identified, but few included recommendations regarding the stated decision problems. The postal survey by clinicians showed that the greatest disagreement is for the use of small molecule GPAs, and the greatest uncertainty exists for decisions regarding the use of abciximab (a large molecule GPA). Overall, decision issues regarding the GPA class of drugs were considered the highest priority for further study. Selected articles describing the clinical efficacy of the treatment were divided into three groups, each representing an alternative strategy. The strategy, which included the use of GPAs as part of the initial medical management of all non-ST-elevation ACS, was the most appropriate choice, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5738 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) by comparison. without using GPAs. Stochastic analysis has shown that if healthcare is willing to pay £10,000 per additional QALY, the probability of this strategy being cost-effective is around 82%, rising to 95% at the £50,000 threshold per QALY. A sensitivity analysis that included an additional strategy of using GPAs as part of initial medical management only in certain high-risk patients (as defined by age, ST depression, or diabetes) showed that this additional strategy was more cost-effective with an ICER. 3996 pounds per QALY compared to no treatment with GPA. The value of information analysis suggested that it is of significant value in additional research to reduce the level of uncertainty in the optimal decision. At a threshold of £10,000 per QALY, the maximum potential value of such research in the baseline was calculated at £12.7 million per year for the UK as a whole. Given the greater uncertainty in sensitivity analyzes, including clopidogrel, this figure has been increased to approximately 50 million pounds. CONCLUSIONS: This study recommends the use of GPAs in all ACS patients without ST elevation as part of their initial medical therapy. Sensitivity analysis showed that almost all benefits could be realized by treating high-risk patients alone. Further clarification of the optimum role of GPAs in the UK NHS depends on the availability of more high-quality observational and trial data. The value of information analysis derived from the model suggests that a relatively large investment in this type of research may be beneficial. Further research should focus on characterizing patients who benefit most from GPAs as part of medical management, comparing GPAs with clopidogrel as an adjunct to standard therapy, and follow-up cohort studies of cost and consequences of high risk. has explored for several years how the decisions of non-ST-elevation ACS and clinicians combine a normative evidence-based decision model with their personal behavioral perspectives.",0,0,
463,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy in addition to pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in primary care: economic evaluation of the CoBalT Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Treating depression is expensive, but providing ineffective treatment is more expensive. This is the case for many patients who do not respond to antidepressant medications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to usual care alone. METHODS: Economic evaluation at 12 months with a randomized controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a cost-outcome framework that compared cost to the health and social care provider, patients, and community across a range of outcomes. Cost-benefit analysis comparing health and social care costs with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The average CBT cost per participant was £910. The difference in QALY gain between the groups was 0.057, which is equivalent to staying healthy 21 days per year. The increased cost-effectiveness ratio was £14 911 (representing 74% probability that the intervention will be cost-effective at the National Institutes for Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000 per QALY). Loss of earnings and productivity costs were significant, but there was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adding CBT to usual care in patients who do not respond to antidepressants is cost-effective. Primary care physicians should therefore be encouraged to refer such individuals to CBT.",0,0,
464,Cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments for low back pain: a systematic review.,"Healthcare costs for low back pain (LBP) are skyrocketing. Therefore, it is important to provide effective and cost-effective treatments. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments for LBP. We searched nine clinical and economic electronic databases and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and included studies for appropriate studies. Randomized controlled trials investigating LBP treatments approved by the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society, as well as economic evaluations conducted, were included. Two independent reviewers scanned the search results and extracted the data. The data extracted included the type and perspective of economic evaluation, treatment comparators, and the relative cost-effectiveness of treatment comparators. Twenty-six studies were included. Most studies have found that interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, or cognitive-behavioral therapy are cost-effective in people with subacute or chronic LBP. Massage alone was unlikely to be cost-effective. There were inconsistent results on the cost-effectiveness of the recommendations, insufficient evidence on spinal manipulation for people with acute LBP, and no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of medications, yoga, or relaxation. This review found evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of guideline-approved treatments of interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for subacute or chronic LBP. There is little or inconsistent evidence for other treatments approved in the guideline.",0,0,
465,Cost-Effectiveness of HIV Pre-exposure Prevention for Injecting Drug Users in the United States,"Background: The overall population health benefits and costs of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for injecting drug users (PWID) in the United States are uncertain. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and optimal application conditions of PrEP for PWID. Design: Empirically calibrated dynamic partition model. Data Sources: Published literature and expert opinion. Target Population: Adult USA PWID. Time Horizon: 20 years and lifetime. Intervention: PrEP only, frequent scan PrEP (PrEP+screen), and PrEP+ Providing enhanced antiretroviral therapy (ART) for screen-infected individuals (PrEP+screen+ART). All scenarios are evaluated at 25%. Outcome Measures: Infections prevented, deaths avoided, change in HIV prevalence, reduced costs (in 2015 USD), reduced quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and increased cost-effectiveness rates. Results of the Baseline Analysis: PrEP+screen+ART dominates other strategies by preventing 26700 infections and reducing the HIV prevalence among EYKs by 14% compared to the status quo. Receiving these benefits is $253 000 per QALY earned. At current drug prices, total expenditures for PrEP+screen+ART could be up to $44 billion over 20 years. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is linear in the annual cost of PrEP and depends on PrEP drug adherence. , risks of individual transmission, and HIV prevalence in the community. Limitation: Data on risk stratification and attainable PrEP efficacy levels for the US EYP are limited. Conclusion: PrEP, which includes frequent screening and prompt treatment for those infected, can reduce the HIV burden among PMUs and provide health benefits for the US population benefits for all, but remains an expensive intervention at current drug prices, both in absolute terms and in terms of cost per QALY earned.",0,0,

467,Costs associated with implementing a computer-assisted clinical decision support system for antenatal and maternity care: a case study of Kassena-Nankana region of northern Ghana.,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the cost of implementing a computer-assisted Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in selected healthcare centers in Ghana. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kassena-Nankana region (KND). CDSS was deployed in selected health centers in the CND as an intervention to manage patients attending antenatal clinics and maternity wards. CDSS users were mostly trained nurses. The activities and associated costs involved in implementing the CDSS (pre-intervention and response) were collected for the period 2009-2013 from the provider perspective. The components approach was used for cost analysis. Costs are grouped into personnel, training, overheads (recurring costs) and equipment costs (capital costs). We calculated the cost by annualizing the cost of capital to represent the financial cost and annualizing the cost of capital to represent the economic cost. RESULTS: Twenty-two trained CDSS users (at least 2 users per health center) participated in the study. Between April 2012 and March 2013, users managed 5,595 antenatal patients and 872 maternity worker clients using CDSS. We observed a reduction in the rate of complications during childbirth (10.74% pre-intervention vs. 9.64% post-intervention) and a reduction in the number of maternal deaths (4 pre-intervention deaths vs. 1 post-intervention death). The overall financial cost of implementing CDSS was US$23,316, approximately US$1,060 per trained CDSS user. 48% (US$11,272) of the total implementation cost was pre-intervention cost and 52% (US$12,044) of the intervention cost. Equipment costs account for the largest portion of the financial cost: 34% (US$7,917). Considering the economic cost, the total implementation cost is US$17,128, which is 26.5% lower than the financial cost. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides useful information in the implementation of CDSS in healthcare settings to increase healthcare professionals' adherence to practice guidelines and to make sound decisions to improve maternal health care.",0,0,
468,"Can clinical surveillance improve the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia?","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of clinical surveillance in improving the quality of diagnostic care provided to patients with suspected tuberculosis"";"" and understanding the contextual factors that hinder or facilitate its success. METHODS: Twenty-six health centers in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia were recruited. Clinical supervision was initiated to improve diagnostic care for patients presenting with suspected TB. The standards were based on WHO and TB program guidelines on the appropriate use of microscopy, culture and radiological investigations. At least two audit cycles have been completed in 2 years. Improvement was determined by comparing performance between the two six-month periods before and after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to identify the factors that facilitate and limit the contextual factors that affect the change in the clinical behavior of health professionals after the start of the clinical audit. RESULTS: We found significant improvement in 11 out of 13 criteria in Cuba, 2 out of 6 criteria in Bolivia, and 2 out of 5 criteria in Peru. Of the 24 inspection criteria in all three countries, 12 met the agreed standards. Barriers to quality improvement included conflicting goals for clinicians and TB programs, poor coordination within the health system, and patients' attitudes towards disease. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical supervision can provide improvements in the quality of clinical care in resource-poor settings. It is likely to be more effective if integrated and supported with native TB programs. We recommend that you develop and evaluate an integrated quality improvement model, including clinical audit.",0,0,
469,Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) trial: a multi-level intervention to improve blood pressure control in hypertensive blacks.,"Despite strong evidence of effective interventions targeting blood pressure (BP) control, there is little evidence to translate these approaches into routine clinical practice in the care of hypertensive blacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multilevel, multicomponent, evidence-based intervention compared with usual care in improving BP control among hypertensive blacks receiving care in community health centers. Primary outcomes are BP control rate at 12 months and maintenance of intervention 1 year after trial. Secondary outcomes are within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) is a randomized clinical trial with 2 conditions: intervention condition and usual care. Thirty community health centers were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition group (n=15) or the usual care group (n=15). The intervention consists of 3 components targeting patients (interactive computerized hypertension education, monthly behavioral counseling on home blood pressure monitoring and lifestyle change) and 2 components targeting physicians (monthly case tours based on the Joint National Committee for Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment). High Blood Pressure guidelines, chart control and providing feedback on clinical performance and patients' home BP readings). All results are evaluated at quarterly study visits for 1 year. A chart review is conducted every 24 months to assess the maintenance of the intervention effects and the sustainability of the response. Poor BP control is one of the main causes of the death gap between blacks and whites. The findings from this study, if successful, will provide the salient information needed to translate and expand evidence-based interventions targeting BP control for this high-risk population into clinical practice.",0,0,
470,Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension: cluster randomized clinical trial main effects,"BACKGROUND: Data on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions targeting blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive blacks receiving care in low-resource primary care settings are limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension was a cluster randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition (IC) or usual care (UC). Patients at IC centers received patient education, home BP monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, while physicians participated in monthly hypertension case tours and received feedback on their patients' home BP readings and chart audits. Printed patient education material and hypertension treatment guidelines were provided to patients and physicians at UC sites, respectively. The primary outcome was BP control, and secondary outcomes were the mean changes in systolic and diastolic BP at 12 months evaluated with the automated BP device. A total of 1059 patients (mean age, 56 years”; 28% male, 59% obese and 36% with diabetes mellitus) were enrolled. The BP control ratio was similar in both groups (IC=49.3% vs UC=44.5%). ; Odds ratio, 1.21 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.63]; P=0.21 In prespecified subgroup analyzes, intervention was associated with greater BP control in patients without diabetes mellitus (IC=54.0% vs. UC=44.7%; odds ratio). , 1.45 [confidence interval, 1.02-2.06]) and small-scale community health centers (IC=51.1% vs. UC=39.6;"" odds ratio, 1.45 [confidence interval, 1, 04-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based, multi-component intervention was no better than UC at improving BP control among hypertensive blacks. Future research on the application of behavioral modification strategies for hypertension control in low-resource settings should focus on the development of more efficient and tailored interventions in this high-risk population.

DESIGN/SETUP: This was a pilot program evaluation using a unit-based, clinical nurse practitioner in the implementation of an interprofessional training program involving simulation in the acute medical setting in a large tertiary care hospital. EXAMPLE: Eighty-four personnel participated in 17 simulations. The sample included first-year internists, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and patient care technicians. METHODS: This was a program evaluation using the TeamSTEPPS Perceptions of Teamwork Questionnaire (T-TPQ) (Classroom slides: TeamSTEPPS fundamentals""; http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/education/curriculum-tools/teamstepps/instructo r/ Essentials /slessentials.html#s3) to assess participants' perceptions of teamwork during pre-simulation/postsimulation sessions. Expected intervention behaviors were collected through observations of participants in simulations and compared with American Heart Association guidelines (Circulation 2010;122:S685 -S670, S235-S337). RESULTS: Fifty-three participants completed their average scores in the leadership category of T-PS before and after T-TPQ From TPQ pretest (median, 2.167) to T-TPQ posttest (median, 2.566) decreased significantly (P = .003) Only 35% of defibrillated groups during ventricular fibrillation simulation scenario This, and only 1 group, delivered this shock within the American Heart Association recommended 2 minute timeframe (Circulation 2010;""122:S235-S337). CONCLUSION: A single resuscitation simulation was not a sufficient dose of intervention for staff to improve the resuscitation process. After staff repeats the program many times, a longitudinal study should be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program. APPLICATIONS: A unit-based quality improvement simulation training program can help improve staff first 5-minute response and resuscitation skills by increasing the frequency of unit-based training overseen by the unit's clinical nurse specialist.",0,0,
472,Creating ICU spaces for safe communication: a video reflex ethnographic study,"Background The built environment in acute care settings is a new focus in patient safety research, with few studies focusing primarily on the design of ward environments and the location and selection of material objects such as lighting fixtures and handwash sinks. Methods We report an intrusive video-reflective ethnographic (VRE) study investigating how clinicians use the built environment to provide safe communication in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a metropolitan Sydney hospital. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews, 5-week observations and four reflective focus groups with a total of 87 participants (including medical, nursing, allied health and office staff). Results We found that the accessibility of staff and patients in the open spaces of the ICU is both a safety feature and a security risk, that secure communication flow is possible and also allows for potentially unsafe interruptions. Staff managed outages by creating temporary protected areas, using physical cues such as curtains, tapes and signs, as well as behavioral cues, movement, and the development of policies that restrict activity in certain areas while maintaining a safe degree of accessibility. In addition, clinicians were able to use the VRE method to gain insight into their practice and problems and develop meaningful solutions for other problem areas. Results Intensive care personnel provide secure communication in their wards by creating both 'attached' and 'protected' temporary spaces. The flexibility of these ""soft"" strategies is particularly well suited to the fast-paced clinical context of intensive care.",0,0,

474,Addressing the influence of antenatal providers on discussions of intimate partner violence,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy poses a significant health risk to the mother and developing fetus. Practice guidelines recommend that antenatal providers screen and counsel their patients for IPV, but many doctors express reluctance or discomfort with such discussions. The Health in Pregnancy (HIP) computer program is designed to enhance the counseling of prenatal care providers on behavioral risks. METHODS: English-speaking women aged 18 years or older, less than 26 weeks pregnant, and receiving prenatal care at one of five San Francisco-area clinics were randomized into parallel groups in a controlled study (data from June 2006 to present “ ;” analyzed June 2007). Participants reporting one or more risks were randomized to intervention or control in stratified blocks. Providers received summary ""signal sheets"" warning their patients of the risk(s) and recommending counseling statements. RESULTS: Thirteen percent (37/286) of the sample reported present IPV. Provider cue resulted in 85% of the IPV-intervention group reporting meetings with their provider, compared to 23.5% of the control group (p<0.001).

475,Cultivating a culture of learning in general practice: an educational intervention,"BACKGROUND: Increasing challenges are faced in primary care, including the rise in chronic diseases and their management in the community. This document describes an educational initiative developed to help local general practitioners (GPs) and primary care teams manage chronic conditions and address referral behavior. The aim of this study is to evaluate the initiative through research of the experiences of the participants and providers. METHODS: Various methods were used to collect data for evaluation. These included feedback from participants in the form of workshop evaluation questionnaires, semi-structured interviews from both participants and presenters, and focus groups with participants. RESULTS: After the analysis of the data, five themes were identified in all the methods used. This article focuses on the main themes of 'practice change' and 'referral behavior' as they relate to the specific aims and objectives of the initiative. The data showed that participants identified actual changes in practice, including changes in individual practice and prescribing behavior, as well as in community health care delivery, following their participation in the educational initiative. The changes identified in referral behavior were evident in feedback from both participants and presenters in the secondary care. Participants noted proposed changes, including an expected reduction in dermatology referrals with better management of the conditions in primary care, and greater awareness of the indications for early referral.

476,Culturally adapted interventions for chronic diseases targeting Korean Americans: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Because little is known about promising interventions to prevent and control chronic diseases in Korean Americans, we conducted a systematic literature review to explore: (1) theoretical frameworks and strategies used in interventions targeting Korean Americans""; (2) these interventions; "" and (3) the extent of their success in engaging Korean participants and improving their health. DESIGN: PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched to identify primary research articles that evaluated interventions to prevent or control chronic disease, tailored to Korean Americans and published from 1980 to 2011, following PRISMA guidelines. Of the 238 articles identified, the 16 unique intervention tests describing 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. These interventions targeted cancer (10), hypertension (2), diabetes (1), mental health (1), quitting tobacco (1), and general health (1). CONCLUSIONS: All included studies have been published since 2000 and reflect the relatively recent establishment of intervention research with Korean Americans. All 16 programs delivered linguistically appropriate messages and training. The 11 programs that achieved significant intervention effects provided or coordinated social support from culturally relevant and well-trained health workers, nurses, or family members during an intervention and/or follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally compatible and linguistically appropriate messages and education may not be sufficient to prevent or control chronic diseases among immigrant Korean Americans. Culturally sensitive and committed social support must be provided to accelerate behavioral changes and maintain the effectiveness of interventions.",0,0,
477,"Current management of transitional feeding problems in preterm neonates born in Queensland, Australia.","BACKGROUND: Many premature newborns have difficulty establishing suckling-feeding proficiency in the weeks following birth. Ineffective management of transitional nutritional problems may result in patient complications and contribute to prolonged hospital stay. OBJECTIVES: Given that many neonatal hospices differ in their neonatal nutrition management practices, the purpose of this study was to explore and document the level of routine support and intervention currently provided for preterm neonates with transitional feeding problems across various level II (special) care) nurseries (SCNs) in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all Queensland SCNs (n=36) in 2005. The questionnaire included a series of closed-choice and short-answer questions designed to gain insight into current practices for managing transitional feeding problems in preterm neonates from each SCN. Results were confirmed during a follow-up phone interview. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 29 SCNs (80.6%). None of these nurseries reported having any formal, written policy regarding the management of transitional feeding problems in preterm neonates. Wide variations have been reported regarding the suction-feeding assessments and interventions used by staff at the various SCNs. Of the 29 nurseries, 4 (13.8%) reported using checklists or assessments to assess readiness to suckle, and 5 (17.2%) reported using pulse oximetry to assess tolerance of sucking attempts. Eighteen SCNs (62.1%) reported offering some form of active intervention to assist newborns with transitional feeding problems; The most common intervention techniques were reported as non-nutritive sucking during tube feeding, pre-feeding oral stimulation, and active step-by-step sucking feedings. Twenty-two SCNs (75.4%) reported having access to a lactation consultant to assist mothers with breastfeeding problems. CONCLUSIONS: Differences have been reported in the routine management of transitional feeding problems in preterm neonates at various Queensland SCNs. It is suggested that evidence-based guidelines need to be developed, and to do this, more research work is needed to identify current best practice and answer the remaining questions.",0,0,
478,Current models and future directions in the treatment of insomnia,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence and high burden associated with chronic insomnia, it is largely unrecognized and often undertreated by physicians. METHODS: The literature on recent trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents for insomnia, as well as barriers to both acute and chronic treatment of insomnia, is reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to appropriate treatment of the condition include the US Food and Drug Administration's outdated insomnia management guidelines that contribute to restrictions on longer prescribing of hypnotic agents""; lack of research demonstrating the benefit of treating insomnia; and tolerance and tolerance of long-term use of hypnotic agents. Fears of lack of longer-term, randomized, controlled, double-blind trials of available agents used to treat insomnia as well as withdrawal effects CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that improved sleep can improve outcome in some medical and psychiatric disorders Both behavioral and pharmacological treatments in chronic insomnia In addition, a recent 6-month, randomized, controlled trial has shown that at least one agent may be safe and effective with longer-term use.",0,0,
479,Restricting lab test ordering in a managed care environment through a computerized order form redesign,"OBJECTIVE: To increase the appropriate use of blood tests for folic acid and vitamin B12 required by primary care physicians in an Israeli managed care facility through a computerized redesign of the order form. STUDY DESIGN: Pre-intervention. METHODS: The new version of the computerized order form is available. Usage patterns were calculated for the previously grouped vitamin B12, folic acid and ferritin tests. Patterns of concomitant use for hemoglobin and iron tests were considered as controls. RESULTS: Tests ordered for 3 targets decreased from 31% to 41% in the month before the intervention, and from 36% to 53% in the following month. Negligible changes in usage patterns were observed in controls (-2% to 3%) in the post-intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: A simple reconfiguration of a computerized order form significantly reduced the number of laboratory tests that were unnecessary or suspected to be unnecessary. When excessive use of laboratory resources is suspected, managers should evaluate the efficiency of the organization's current ordering procedures before implementing resource-intensive interventions.",1,1,

METHODS: A prospective two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial. Patients with osteoarthritis were eligible if they understood English and were referred for surgical consultation about the first total knee arthroplasty at a Canadian orthopedic joint evaluation clinic. Patients were randomized to PtDA intervention or usual training. The intervention was an osteoarthritis PtDA for patients and a one-page preference report for their surgeons outlining patients' clinical and decision data. The main feasibility outcomes were recruitment and survey completion rates""; preliminary efficacy results were wait times and decision quality. RESULTS: Of 180 patients eligible for surgical consultation, 142 (79%) were recruited and randomized to PtDA intervention (n = 71) or normal. education (n = 71) Data collection yielded a 93% questionnaire completion rate with less than 1% missing items. After one year 13% of patients remained on the surgical waiting list out of the waiting list (censored using survival analysis techniques ) were 33.4 weeks (n = 69, 95% CI: 26.0, 41.4) for the PtDA group and 33.0 weeks for usual training (n = 71, 95% CI: 26.1, 39.9). Patients exposed to PtDA were informed As a result, it had higher decision quality (71% vs. 47%; p <0.0001) and that the quality decision was an informed choice that was consistent with option outcomes values (56.4% vs. 25.0%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of patients with osteoarthritis was possible considering surgery and data collection. Follow-up should be increased to two years, as some patients remain on the surgical waiting list after one year. Patients exposed to PtDA achieved higher decision quality compared to those with normal training, but there was no difference in waiting for surgery.

483,Decision making in the surgical management of chronic low back pain: performance of prognostic tests to select patients for lumbar spinal fusion.,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the main causes of disability in the western world, which places a huge economic burden on society. A specific underlying anatomical cause for CLBP has not yet been identified. Imaging usually reveals degenerative signs of one or more lumbar motion segments, disc or facet joints. However, these findings can also be seen in asymptomatic individuals. It has been suggested that pain in degenerated discs may result from the growth of nerve fibers into tears or clefts of the annulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus, and from reported high levels of proinflammatory mediators. Since this so-called discogenic pain is often exacerbated by mechanical loading, the concept of relieving pain with spinal fusion was developed to stabilize a painful spinal segment. Lumbar spinal fusion is indeed beneficial for some patients, but outcomes are highly variable and difficult to predict for the individual patient. To identify CLBP patients who would benefit from fusion, many surgeons rely on tests that are supposed to predict the outcome of spinal fusion. The three most commonly used prognostic tests in daily practice are lumbosacral orthosis immobilization, provocative discography, and trial immobilization with temporary external transpedicular fixation. Knowing the role and value of these prognostic tests for CLBP patients in clinical practice is essential in targeting consensus on indications for lumbar fusion and improving patient selection and outcomes. The overall objectives of this thesis were: 1) to evaluate whether there is consensus among spine surgeons on the use and evaluation of prognostic tests for lumbar spinal fusion""; 2) to confirm whether a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) actually minimizes lumbosacral motion; 3) a TLSO To confirm whether CLBP can predict the clinical outcome of fusion for CLBP; 4) to evaluate whether provocative discography of adjacent segments does indeed predict long-term clinical outcome fusion; 5) there is a need for routine antibiotic prophylaxis to determine the incidence and occurrence of discitis after discography; 6) transient to evaluate whether external transpedicular fixation (TETF) would help predict the outcome of spinal fusion; 7) To determine the prognostic accuracy of the tests most commonly used in clinical practice to predict the outcome of fusion for CLBP. The results of a national survey among spine surgeons in the Netherlands are presented in Study I. Surgeons were asked about their views on prognostic factors and the use of predictive tests for lumbar fusion in CLBP patients. Interpretations were compared with findings from the current literature. The survey revealed a significant lack of uniformity in the use and evaluation of predictive tests. Prognostic factors known from the literature have also not been consistently included in the decision-making processes of surgeons. This heterogeneity in strategy is most likely due to the lack of solid scientific evidence for available predictive tests, and it has been concluded that there is currently insufficient consensus among Dutch spine surgeons to establish national guidelines for surgical decision-making in CLBP. In Study II, the putative working mechanism of a pantaloon pattern (ie, minimization of lumbosacral joint mobility) was examined. In patients admitted for a temporary external transpedicular fixation test (TETF), infrared light markers were rigidly affixed to the protruding ends of Steinman pins fixed at the two spinal level. In this way, the three-dimensional motion between these levels can be analyzed opto-electronically. During dynamic test conditions such as walking, a cast with or without unilateral hip fixation did not significantly reduce lumbosacral joint motion. Although not proven with solid scientific support, lumbosacral orthoses or pantaloon molds are often used in daily practice as an indicator of the result of fusion. A systematic review of the literature, supplemented by a prospective cohort study, was performed to assess the value of the pantaloon pattern in surgical decision making (Study III). It turned out that only in CLBP patients who had not had prior spinal surgery, a pantaloon cast test that significantly reduced pain revealed a positive outcome of lumbar fusion compared to conservative treatment. The test is of no value in patients who have had previous spinal surgery. It is believed by many spine surgeons that provocative discography, unlike plain radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging, is a physiological test that can truly determine whether a disc is painful and whether it is related to the patient's pain syndrome, regardless of disc morphology. It has been suggested that in order to achieve a successful clinical outcome of lumbar fusion, suspected discs should be painful and adjacent control discs should not cause pain in provocative discography. Therefore, a cohort of patients for whom the decision to perform a lumbar fusion was based on the external fixation (TETF) study was retrospectively analyzed in Study IV. Only the preoperative discography results of the levels adjacent to the fusion were compared with the clinical results after spinal fusion. In this selected group of patients, the discographic status of discs adjacent to the lumbar fusion appeared to have no effect on clinical outcome. The most feared complication of lumbar discography is discitis. Although its incidence is low, it is a serious complication for a diagnostic procedure and prevention with the use of prophylactic antibiotics is advocated. When searching clinical guidelines, the risk of discitis after discography was assessed in Study V through a systematic literature review and a cohort of 200 consecutive patients. In the absence of prophylactic antibiotics, the overall incidence of discitis after discography was 0.25%. To prove that antibiotics will actually prevent discitis, a randomized trial of 9,000 patients will be needed to reach significance. Considering the possible side effects of antibiotics, it was concluded that the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in lumbar discography is not indicated. In Study VI, the medium- and long-term outcomes of external fixation (TETF) as a test for predicting the clinical outcome of lumbar fusion were examined in a group of back pain patients with doubts about the indication for surgery. The test included a placebo trial in which patients were unaware of whether the lumbar segmental levels were stable or dynamic. Using strict and objective pain reduction criteria on a visual analog scale, the TETF test failed to predict the clinical outcome of fusion in this selected group of patients. Pin tract infection and nerve root irritation have been noted as complications of this invasive test. It was concluded that TETF is not recommended as a complementary tool in surgical decision making in patients with chronic low back pain whose fusion indication is doubtful. In Study VII, a systematic literature review was conducted regarding the prognostic accuracy of tests currently used in clinical practice that are presumed to predict the outcome of lumbar spinal fusion for CLBP. Tests of interest were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TLSO immobilization, TETF, provocative discography, and facet joint infiltration. Only 10 studies can be selected that report on three different index tests (discography, TLSO immobilization, and TETF) that actually report on test qualifiers such as sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. The accuracy of all prognostic tests appeared to be low; this confirmed that in many clinical applications patients are programmed for fusion based on tests with poor accuracy or unknown at best. As the overall methodological quality of the included studies was low, higher quality studies would be needed that would include patients who tested positive for fusion as well as patients who tested negative. It was concluded that the best evidence at this time does not support the use of any prognostic test in clinical practice. No patient group with low back pain for whom spinal fusion was a safe and effective treatment could be identified. There are many studies in the literature reporting that cognitive behavioral therapy or intensive exercise programs have similar treatment outcomes to spinal fusion, but with significantly less complications, morbidity, and cost. These tests should not be recommended for surgical decision making in standard care, as the findings of the current thesis show that currently used tests do not improve fusion outcomes with better patient selection. Also, spinal fusion should not be recommended as a standard treatment for chronic low back pain. The causation of non-specific spinal pain is complex and CLBP should not be viewed as a diagnosis but as a symptom in patients with different stages of impairment and disability. Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting or Spine Center according to the biopsychosocial model, which aims to identify underlying psychosocial factors as well as biological factors. Treatment should be carried out gradually, starting with the least invasive treatment. The current approach of CLBP with an emphasis on self-management and empowerment is recommended so that patients receive an active course of treatment to prevent long-term disability and chronicity.",0,0,

Recent findings Defaults often lag behind predicted effects when used in intensive care settings as quality improvement interventions. Studies reporting the use of defaults are often limited to variations in relative impact between sites. Pre-application experiments and long-term follow-up studies are lacking. Summary ICU defaults can either help or harm patients and clinical efficiency, depending on their form and use.

487,The default settings of the computerized doctor order entry system determine ordering habits.,"Background: Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems are rapidly ubiquitous, and order groups (""order sets"") that allow easy order entry are a common feature. This provides a streamlined mechanism for viewing, modifying and placing related order groups. This often serves as the electronic equivalent of a request for expertise. A feature of these order sets is that certain orders can be preset as ""preselected"" or ""open by default"" each time the order set is used, while others are ""optional"" or ""closed by default"". usually the option is to “deselect” tests that are set as default in a particular case. While it may seem intuitive that defaults in an order set are generally accepted, additional work is required to understand the impact of these ""default"" settings in an order set on ordering habits. This study set out to measure the effect of changing the default settings of an order set. Methods: For the purpose of quality improvement, order sets for transfusions were recently reviewed and modified to improve outcome tracking. Initially, the default setting for post-transfusion hematocrit and platelet count rankings was changed from ""optional"" to ""preselected"". The default settings for the platelet count were then changed back to ""optional"", allowing a natural experiment. Examine the impact of default choices of an order set on clinician ordering habits. Results: Post-transfusion hematocrit values were ordered for 8.3% of red cell transfusions when the default order set selection was ""off"" and 57.4% of transfusions when the default order set selection was ""preselected"" (P < 0.0001). Post-transfusion platelet count was ordered for 7.0% of platelet transfusions when the initial default order set selection was “optional”, increased to 59.4% when the default was changed to “preselected” (P < 0.0001), and then Reduced to 7.5. %. when the default selection is returned as ""optional"". Post-transfusion platelet count rates during the two 'on-demand' periods: 7.0% versus 7.5% - were not statistically different (P = 0.620). Discussion: The default settings in CPOE order sets can significantly affect the physician's choice of laboratory tests. All stakeholders, including clinicians and pathologists, should be carefully considered when creating default settings for order sets.",1,1,
488,Defensive Medicine Among High-Risk Specialists in a Volatile Malpractice Environment,"Context How often physicians change their clinical behavior due to the threat of malpractice liability, so-called defensive medicine, and the consequences of these changes are central questions in the ongoing debate on medical malpractice reform. Purpose To examine the prevalence and characteristics of defensive medicine among physicians working in high-responsibility specialties during a period of significant instability in the malpractice environment. Design, Environment, and Participants Mail survey of physicians in 6 specialties (emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology) at high risk of litigation in Pennsylvania in May 2003. Key Outcome Measures defensive medicine or any specialty that reports changes in scope of practice and characteristics of defensive medicine (assurance and avoidance behaviour). Results A total of 824 physicians (65%) completed the survey. Almost all (93%) reported using defensive medicine. “Assurance behavior” such as ordering tests, performing diagnostic procedures, and referring patients for consultation was very common (92%). Among defensive medicine practitioners who detail their most recent defensive actions, 43% reported using imaging technology in clinically unnecessary situations. Avoidance of procedures and patients thought to increase the likelihood of litigation was also common. Forty-two percent of respondents reported that they had taken steps to restrict their practice in the past 3 years, including eliminating procedures prone to complications such as trauma surgery and avoiding patients with complex medical problems or perceived as defendants. Advocacy practices were strongly associated with respondents' lack of confidence in their liability insurance and the perceived burden of insurance premiums. Conclusion Defensive medicine is prevalent among physicians in Pennsylvania who pay the most for liability insurance, with potentially serious implications for cost, access, and quality of care, both technical and interpersonal.",0,0,
489,Defining optimal therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease,"Despite a growing understanding that Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global public health and social care crisis, diagnosis is often slow and many patients still receive no treatment at all. Most of those treated stay below the recommended doses. The International Global Declaration on Alzheimer's Disease promotes awareness and understanding of AD by emphasizing the importance of optimal treatment. However, the definition of ""optimal treatment"" is vague. Since cholinesterase inhibitors became available nearly 20 years ago, clinicians have developed various protocols based on clinical experience. This review considers what is optimal for various aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, taking into account initiation strategies, dosages, modes of administration (eg, oral and transdermal), and duration of treatment. Regardless of the management approach, individuals with AD, their families and caregivers have the right to timely diagnosis and access to the best available treatment.",0,0,

Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and a screening device for children with special health care needs. RESULTS: 43 pediatricians and 9 pediatricians with a total of patients aged 0 to 19 years. 483 visits were observed by the intermediate provider.The adjusted average visit time was 20.3 minutes and 38.9% of visits started with an open-ended question about parent/child concerns 7.2 health checkup/expected guidance issues were covered per visit. addressed 42% - recommended age specific right Mindfulness control/ stimulant guidance topics. Topics covered less frequently than recommended included family support, parental health, behavior/discipline, physical activity, media screen time, risk reduction/substance use, adolescence/gender, social peer interactions, and violence. Shorter visits were associated with asking about parent/child concerns and addressing greater proportions of recommended checkup/expectancy guidance. Well-child care visits with children with special health care needs were 36% longer than with children without special needs, addressing a similar number of age-specific health checks/predictive guidance. More time was spent with children with special health care needs addressing health surveillance/expected guidance issues, other conditions (often chronic conditions), and testing, prescriptions and referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Using direct observation of visits with pediatric clinicians, we found that soliciting parent/child concerns occurred less frequently than recommended. Less than half of the recommended visit-specific health check/expectancy guidance issues were addressed, and there was little agreement with some of the Bright Futures age group-specific recommendations. In particular, both raising patient/parent concerns and greater adherence to health checkup/expected guidance recommendations were associated with shorter visits. Well-child care visits with children with special health care needs were longer than with children without special needs; “More time was spent on a similar number of health monitoring/expectation guidance issues, as well as chronic conditions.",0,0,
491,Demand management for planned maintenance: a realistic synthesis.,"Â The task of matching changing demand with available capacity is one of the key challenges in all large-scale service industries. It is a particularly urgent concern in modern healthcare systems as growing demand (aging population, availability of new treatments, increasing patient knowledge, etc.) is faced with stagnant supply (capacity and funding constraints on staff and services, etc.). As a result, a very broad portfolio of demand management strategies has been developed, based on quite different assumptions about the source of the problem and solutions. This report provides an important review of the effectiveness of key strategies designed to alleviate demand pressures in planned maintenance. The study begins with an overview of key ideas about the formation of problems of demand and capacity for health services. Many different diagnoses have been uncovered: fluctuating demand meets fixed capacity""; territorial protection between different providers; social rather than clinical pressures on referral decisions; self-driving diagnostic cascades; supplier-driven demand; demographic pressures on treatment; and informed patient and demand after-demand imbalance. We conducted a review of the key ideas (programme theories) underlying interventions designed to address them. We discovered that there was no close fit between the problems claimed and the solutions advocated. Strategic decision making, organizational re-engineering, procedural changes, and behavior change levels When mapping reform ideas, the program We also noted the tendency for 'whole-system' theories of Includes a realistic synthesis: referral management centers (RMCs); employing general practitioners (GPwSIs) with special interests at the interface between primary and secondary care; GP direct access to clinical tests; and shipping instructions. In any case, we encountered a checkered pattern of success and failure. The primary literature is replete with descriptions of unexpected problems and undesirable effects. These programs 'work' only under very limited conditions. To give brief examples, we have found that the success of RMCs is highly dependent on the balance of control in their governance structures; GPwSIs affect demand only after close negotiations on the agreed and intermediate state mix; significant efficiencies are created mainly by direct GP access to tests when there are low diagnostic yields and high 'exclusion' rates, and referral guidelines are more likely to work when implemented by staff responsible for their creation. The report concludes that it is not a 'preferred intervention' capable of outperforming others. Instead, the review found many, varied, hard-won, local and adaptable solutions. Whatever the starting point, success in demand management depends on synchronizing a complex set of strategic elements. organizational, procedural and motivational changes The final section offers practitioners some guidance on how to 'think' about all the interdependencies that balance demand and capacity. The different local contexts in which mixed methods are used will be valuable for understanding the processes by which such interventions take place. ounce adapted to local conditions. There is also space for further evidence synthesis. Substitution theory is ubiquitous in health and social care and would be valuable to determine a realistic synthesis to compare the fortunes of different practitioners (eg nurses/doctors, dentists/dental care practitioners, radiologists/radiographers, etc.) placed across different professional boundaries. contexts and mechanisms in which substitution, support or short-circuiting occurs.

492,Dementia care management: Going new avenues in outpatient dementia care in a GP-based randomized controlled intervention trial,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia is a major challenge for the German healthcare system. The Delphi-MV study (""Dementia: life and person-centered assistance in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania"") aims to implement and evaluate an innovative helper support system for people living at home with dementia (PwDs) and their caregivers. METHODS: Delphi-MV is a GP-based cluster randomized controlled intervention trial. Delphi-Intervention aims to provide ""optimal care"" by integrating multi-professional and multi-modal strategies to customize and optimize dementia treatment within the framework of the established health and social service system. Intervention is carried out in people's homes by Dementia Care Managers (DCMs) - nurses with special training for dementia. Based on German guidelines for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of dementia, a comprehensive set of 95 intervention modules - the ""DelpHi-Standard"" - has been defined. Each module consists of predefined trigger conditions, a subsequent response task, and at least one criterion for completion. The intervention begins with a comprehensive assessment of the care situation, needs and resources. DCM develops and implements an intervention plan tailored to individual circumstances in close collaboration with the GP. EXPECTED RESULTS AND RESULTS: We expect statistically significant differences in primary outcomes (quality of life, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, pharmacotherapy, caregiver burden) between the control and intervention group. The results may provide evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of dementia care management according to the ""Delphi-Standard"" - prerequisites for the application of this concept to routine health care.",0,0,

495,Design and evaluation of a computer reminder system to improve the prescribing behavior of GPs,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a decision support system with reactive computer reminders to improve drug prescribing behavior. METHODS: A clustered RCT with incomplete block design was conducted in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs received reminders about antibiotic and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs received reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescribing guides were integrated into the family physician information system established in the GP practices of the intervention group. While the computer program was in use, a reminder appeared if the GP deviated from the guidelines during prescribing. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Prescribing according to guidelines as a percentage of total prescriptions for a given drug. In addition, an assessment was made of the user-friendliness of the CRS in GP practice through questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: Analyzes are currently underway. Preliminary results show that the CRS study supports our expectations. Overall, there appears to be a decrease in the number of prescriptions based on computerized guidelines for not prescribing certain drugs. Final analysis will be done as soon as possible. In general, the Computer Reminder System was perceived as stable and user-friendly. CONCLUSION: We have created a stable and user-friendly Computer Reminder System adjusted to the needs and demands of GPs. Preliminary results on the effectiveness of the system show that the implementation of a Computer Reminder System with reactive reminders improves drug prescribing behavior.",0,1,
496,Education design and implementation to improve pediatric overweight management,"INTRODUCTION: Clinicians report low proficiency in treating overweight children and using behavioral management strategies. This article documents the design and implementation of a training program to develop clinicians' skills in the assessment and behavioral management of pediatric overweight. METHODS: Two one-hour CME courses were designed using published guidelines, research findings, and expert committee recommendations. Training was delivered to clinicians of a managed care pediatrics department using new screening and counseling tools and interactive exercises. Questionnaires and focus groups were conducted 3 and 6 months after the intervention to examine the clinician's attitudes and practices regarding screening and counseling tools. CONCLUSIONS: Post-intervention, most clinicians agree that clinical practice guidelines (Pediatric Obesity Practice Resource) and percentage BMI for age provide useful information for clinical practice. Clinicians have reported increased use of recommended screening tools and changes in office practices to implement these tools. They made recommendations to improve the ease of use of the tools and to overcome perceived clinician and/or patient barriers. CONCLUSION: The provision of a concise, cost-effective, versatile training and counseling tool was perceived as aiding clinical practice. Useful lessons were learned about tool design and ways to put tools into practice. Training the entire healthcare team is advantageous for adopting new tools and practices.",0,0,

METHODS: An ongoing multicenter, researcher-blind, randomized controlled trial in Canada and the United States will enroll cardiologists and primary care physicians working in an outpatient setting. The intervention arm will be provided with (1) a course summarizing the latest available evidence highlighting the AUC and appropriate use of TTE, (2) access to the American Society of Echocardiography mobile phone app, and (3) individualized emailed monthly summarizing feedback reports. TTE order behavior, including information about ineligible TTEs and brief descriptions of the ineligible assignment. The control group will receive no training in the appropriate use of TTE and will not order TTEs as usual practice. CONCLUSIONS: The Echo WISELY (Inappropriate Scenarios for Echocardiography RCT Will Significantly Reduce in One Training) study is the first multicenter randomized study of an AUC-based educational intervention. The study will examine whether an education and feedback intervention can reduce the rate of inappropriate TTE ordered by outpatient cardiologists and primary care physicians (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02038101).",0,0,
498,Design factors for the success or failure of guided decision support systems: a hypothesis involving case complexity.,"Computer-based decision support systems (CDSSs) are currently mostly reminder systems. However, the effectiveness of such systems in changing physician behavior is not always observed. We assume that this approach is appropriate for simple clinical cases when doctors think they know how to prescribe and do not need help. Conversely, discretionary approaches that allow flexibility in the interpretation of patient conditions are more appropriate for more complex cases, such as chronic disease management. ASTI is a CDSS that works in two modes, a crit mode that works as a reminder-based system, and a user-initiated referral mode. Using a clinical case complexity score, a pre/post intervention trial was conducted with 10 GP and 15 hypertensive patient cases. Preliminary results tend to show that reminder-based interaction is appropriate for simple cases and that as clinical situations become complex, physicians are willing to use optional systems, complementing both modes.",1,1,

We outline high reliability design principles for healthcare organizations, including both formal structures and informal practices that complement them. buildings. An organizational structure and implementation phase model is used to illustrate the typical challenges and design possibilities at each stage, moving from local autonomy to formal controls, open inquiry and deep self-understanding. We suggest how organizations can use the concepts and examples presented to increase their capacity to self-design for security and reliability.",0,1,
500,"Design of the Balance@Work project: systematic development, evaluation and implementation of an occupational health guide aimed at preventing weight gain among employees","BACKGROUND: Occupational health professionals can play an important role in preventive health promotion activities for workers. However, due to the lack of information, evidence and practice-based methods and strategies, interventions have not been implemented by occupational physicians until today. The aim of the Balance@Work project is to develop, evaluate and implement an occupational health guide to prevent weight gain among employees. METHODS: Following the Dutch Society of Occupational Medicine's guideline development protocol and Intervention Mapping protocol, the guideline was developed based on the literature, discussions with relevant stakeholders, and consensus among an expert group. The guide consists of an individual and an environmental component. The individual component includes recommendations for occupational physicians on how to promote physical activity and healthy eating behavior based on motivational interviewing principles. The environmental component includes an obesogenic environmental assessment tool. The guideline was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial among 20 occupational physicians. Occupational physicians in the intervention group apply the guideline to eligible workers for 6 months. Occupational physicians in the control group provide care as usual. Measurements are performed at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 18 months. Primary outcome measures include waist circumference, daily physical activity, and dietary behavior. Secondary outcome measures include sedentary behavior, predictors of behavior change, body weight and body mass index, cardiovascular disease risk profile, and quality of life. In addition, efficiency, absenteeism and cost-effectiveness are evaluated. CONCLUSION: Improving employees' daily physical activities and dietary behaviors can prevent weight gain and, in turn, improve employee health, increase productivity, and reduce absenteeism. After an impact and process assessment, the guideline will be revised and published after authorization. Along with a few practice aids, the published guide will be widely distributed by the Dutch Association for Occupational Medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN73545254/NTR1190.",0,0,
501,"Design, implementation and evaluation of an information translation intervention to increase organ donation after cardiovascular death in Canada: a study protocol.","Background The scarcity of transplantable organs is a global problem. There are two types of organ donation: living and dying. Organ donation of the deceased may occur after neurological determination of death (NDD) or cardio-circulatory death. Post-cardiocirculatory death (DCD) donation is responsible for the largest increases in deceased organ donation worldwide. However, differences in DCD usage exist in Canada and around the world. The reasons for these inconsistencies are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate a theory-based information translation intervention to provide practical guidance on how to increase the number of DCD organ donors without reducing the number of standard NDD donors. Methods We will use a three-stage hybrid method. In step one, we will conduct semi-structured interviews informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify and describe stakeholders' beliefs and attitudes about DCD and their perceptions of the multilevel factors influencing DCD. We will identify: determinants of the evidence-practice gap""; specific behavioral changes and/or process changes needed to increase DCD; specific clinicians or organizations that need behavior change (eg, provincial donors)""; and specific targets for interventions. In a second step, we will develop a theory-based knowledge translation intervention that encompasses behavior modification techniques to overcome identified barriers and enhance those that enable DCD, using the principles of intervention mapping. In a third step, we will make the intervention available to hospitals in 10 Canadian provinces and evaluate its effectiveness using a multiple discontinuous time series design. Discussion We will take a behavioral approach to identify and test new, theory-based and ethically acceptable information translation strategies to increase the number of available DCD organ donors in Canada. If successful, this study will eventually lead to more transplants and reduce patient morbidity and mortality at the population level.",0,0,
502,Designing a patient-centered personal health record to promote preventive care,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based preventive services offer significant health benefits, but Americans receive only half of the care specified. Various government and private community policy initiatives are promoting the adoption of information technologies, such as personal health records, to involve patients in their care, but current systems may not exploit the technology's full potential. METHODS: Using a model previously described to make information technology more patient-centered, we developed an interactive preventive health record (IPHR) designed to engage patients more deeply in preventive care and health promotion. We recruited 14 core care practices to introduce IPHR to all adult patients and sought practice and patient input in its design to ensure usability, specificity, and generalizability of IPHR. Input included patient usability testing, practice workflow observations, learning collaborations, and patient feedback. Use of IPHR was measured using practice appointment and IPHR databases. RESULTS: Emerging from this process, IPHR creates personalized patient recommendations based on guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other organizations. Extracts clinical data from applications' electronic medical records and retrieves health risk assessment information from patients. The clinical content is translated and explained in ordinary language. Recommendations review the benefits and uncertainties of services and possible actions for patients and clinicians. Recommendations include self-management tools, risk calculators, decision aids, and community resources selected to suit the patient's clinical circumstances. Within six months, practices encouraged 14.4% of patients to use IPHR (ranging from 1.5% to 28.3% in 14 practices). Applications have successfully incorporated IPHR into the workflow, using it to prepare patients for visits, increase health behavior counseling, annotate test results, automatically issue patient reminders for delayed services, notify clinicians about required services, and formulate personalized prevention plans. CONCLUSIONS: IPHR demonstrates that a patient-centered personal health record that interfaces with the electronic medical record can provide patients with a high level of personalized guidance and can be successfully adopted by intensive primary care practices. More work and improvement is needed to make information systems even more patient-centred and to demonstrate their impact on care.

503,Designing a valid randomized pragmatic primary care practice trial: my own medical report (MOHR) project,"Background There is an urgent need for greater attention to patient-centered health behavior and psychosocial issues and practical tools, study designs, and clinical and policy implications in primary care. Our goal is to design a scientifically rigorous and valid pragmatic trial to test whether primary care practices can systematically apply the collection of patient-reported information, and to provide patients with the necessary advice, goal setting, and counseling in response. Methods This manuscript reports on the iterative design of the My Own Health Report (MOHR), a cluster randomized delayed intervention trial. Nine couples of various primary care practices will be randomized to either early or delayed intervention after four months. The intervention includes the MOHR assessment addressing 10 areas of Â¨C health behaviors and psychosocial issues, followed by providing necessary counseling and support for patients presenting for health or chronic care. As a pragmatic participatory trial, stakeholder groups, including practice partners and patients, were included throughout the study design to take local resources and characteristics into account. Participatory tasks include determining the content of the MOHR assessment, improving the study design, providing input to outcome measures, and designing the implementation workflow. Study outcomes include intervention access (percentage of patients offered and completing the MOHR assessment), effectiveness (patients reporting being asked about issues, setting change targets, and receiving assistance in implementing early and delayed intervention), contextual factors affecting outcomes, and intervention costs. . Discussion The MOHR study demonstrates how a participatory design can be used to promote the consistent collection and use of patient-reported health behaviors and psychosocial assessments in a wide range of primary care settings. While pragmatic in nature, the study design would allow valid comparisons to answer the research question posed, and the findings can be generalized to a range of primary care settings. According to the pragmatic explanatory continuity indicator summary (PRECIS) framework, the study design is significantly more pragmatic than other published studies. The methods and findings should be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers seeking to make healthcare more patient-centered and relevant.",0,1,
504,Detection and management of alcohol use disorders influenced by non-clinical factors in German primary care,"OBJECTIVES: The primary aim was to evaluate the proportion of patients identified and correctly referred in German primary care. The secondary aim was to identify patient and practitioner characteristics that predict detection and correct referral. METHODS: In this clustered cross-sectional survey in German primary care, 3003 consecutive patients were invited to participate and asked to complete a standard health questionnaire. Then, problematic alcohol consumption was screened using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Physicians recorded their assessment of the presence of any alcohol use disorder and documented the course of treatment for all patients identified for 3 months. RESULTS: Correctly identified problem drinkers were 38.6% in a per-protocol analysis and 33.6% using the worst-case scenario. Physicians' referral behavior was in line with current practice guidelines in 64.6% of documented cases and 27.0% in the worst-case scenario. Several patient (eg, gender, age) and practitioner characteristics (eg, age) can be identified that affect the diagnosis and referral of patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need to increase specialized diagnostic and therapeutic skills so that general practitioners can identify and apply secondary prevention. Further research should focus on the potential implications of applying these diagnostic and management tools.",0,0,
505,Detection of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in relatives of patients with type I diabetes,"Lymphocytotoxic antibody concentrations were measured in serum samples from 19 patients recently diagnosed with type I diabetes and 43 healthy relatives (33 relatives and 10 unrelated). The specificity of the reaction was tested at 15°C and 37°C against T lymphocytes and purified helper/inducer and cytotoxic/repressor subsets. Concentrations of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in each of the three test groups were significantly higher than in controls (type I patients, p<0.005; consanguineous relatives, p<0.001; and unrelated relatives, p<0.002). The frequency of detection of antibodies was also higher in each of the study groups (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, and p less than 0.05, respectively). Cytotoxicity affected both subgroups at 15 degrees C, but only cytotoxic/suppressor cells at 37 degrees C. Findings of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in healthy relatives of type I diabetics, regardless of consanguinity, suggest that an environmental agent such as a virus is at least partially responsible. for this lymphocytotoxic effect. Furthermore, residual cytotoxic/suppressor cell killing at 37°C may explain the suppressor cell defect observed in these patients.",0,0,

507,Determinants of successful clinical networks: conceptual framework and study protocol,"Background Clinical networks are increasingly seen as an important strategy for enhancing evidence-based practice and improving care models, but success is variable and the characteristics of high-impact networks are uncertain. This study takes advantage of the variability in the functioning and outcomes of networks supported by the Australian New South Wales (NSW) Agency for Clinical Innovation's non-mandatory clinical network model to explore the factors that contribute to the success of clinical networks. Methods/Design The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the relationship between external support, organizational and program factors, and indicators of success among 19 clinical networks over a three-year period (2006-2008). Results (health impact, system impact, programs implemented, participation, user perception and financial leverage) and explanatory factors will be collected using a web-based questionnaire, interviews, and record review. An independent panel of experts will make judgments about the impact or extent of each network's initiatives on health and system impacts. The expert panel's ratings will be the result used in multivariate analyses. Following the rating of network success, a qualitative study will be conducted to provide a more in-depth examination of the most successful networks. Discussion This is the first study to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the factors that contribute to the success of clinical networks, and more generally, it is the largest study of clinical networks performed. Adapting expert panel methods to rate the effects of networks is the methodological novelty of this study. The proposed project will identify conditions that should be created or promoted by agencies developing clinical networks and will be used immediately in formulating strategies and programs to maximize the effectiveness of these networks.",0,0,
508,Developing a managed clinical network in palliative care: a realistic assessment,"BACKGROUND: Achieving evidence-based practice is at the forefront of the international practice development agenda. Therefore, it is imperative that robust evaluation methodologies are in place to examine new approaches to service development. OBJECTIVES: This article reflects the benefits and challenges of realistic assessment design in establishing a new managed clinical network (MCN) approach to implementing a guideline for the care of individuals with cancer-related pain. DESIGN AND METHODS: There were three assessment points examining three versions of the MCN approach to care. At each stage, steps were taken to identify the context, mechanisms, and consequences associated with the model version under consideration. Findings from patient-centered case studies fed realistic assessment interviews with the management group. SETTING: A rural primary care setting in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Three elderly men, their families, and doctors and nurses providing direct care, along with 13 members of the network management group. CONCLUSIONS: The research highlighted the level of practitioner effort required to introduce the MCN approach to care. Progress was much slower than expected, frustrated at times by inexperience in change management and unfamiliarity with leading practice development projects and supporting practitioner learning. Problems with the age appropriateness of the evidence base for the care of the fragile elderly were also evident. The occupational group that experienced the most role changes are regional nurses and community pharmacists. CONCLUSION: The collaborative approach fueled by the realistic assessment framework was found particularly helpful and there was consensus that assessment became an integral part of the intervention itself. There were a number of methodological difficulties and the need to limit the depth of 'realistic resolution'. However, as a formative approach in the complex world of interdisciplinary practice development, realistic assessment has proven to be a valuable design.",0,0,
509,Development of a pain assessment tool for use by nurses in an adult intensive care unit,"Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to pain, citing this as the second largest intensive care stressor. Pain has also been identified as a complicating factor in critical illness. Despite this, pain management is not often seen as a priority by the intensive care team. Effective management can only be achieved with accurate pain assessment. However, this is difficult in critically ill patients as patients are often unable to communicate verbally due to the presence of endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes, sedation and paralyzing agents. Therefore, nurses rely on behavioral and physiological indicators to determine the presence of pain. However, since these occur in situations and situations that are not related to pain, a systematic, objective assessment tool is needed. Such a tool, consisting of a numerical and verbal rating scale, to facilitate documentation and auditing has been developed as a result of ongoing adjustment and evaluation. The tool scores the patient's pain by combining behavioral and physiological indicators and is used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Score and the modified Sheffield Sedation Scale to obtain a comprehensive neurological assessment. As movement and intervention may exacerbate pain, assessment is done at rest and during procedures such as aspiration and manual handling. A flowchart and clinical guideline are also provided as an aid to pain assessment and management. Although pre-assessment demonstrated the efficacy of the tool as a tool to predict and record pain levels in individual patients, it was clear that there was no change in the way pain was managed. To address this issue, nurses' understanding of pain management was determined and teaching sessions were conducted to increase the pain management profile in the unit.",0,0,
510,Developing science of clinical utility in fieldwork strategies in diagnostic classification systems for ICD-11 mental and behavioral disorders,"The World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse has developed a systematic program of field studies to evaluate and improve the clinical utility of diagnostic guidelines for mental and behavioral disorders recommended in the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases. Related Health Issues (ICD-11). The clinical utility of diagnostic classification, its function as the interface between health encounters and health information, and the ICD-11 disease burden of mental disorders globally in 194 member states of WHO, including the United States. This article describes WHO's efforts to develop a science of clinical utility regarding one of the two main classification systems for mental disorders. We provide rationale and methodologies for an integrated and complementary set of fieldwork strategies, including major international surveys, formative field studies of the structure of clinicians conceptualizing mental disorders, case-controlled field studies using experimental methodologies to evaluate the impact of recommendations. Changes to diagnostic guidelines for clinicians' diagnostic decision making and ecological application field studies of clinical utility in global settings where the guidelines will ultimately be applied. The results of these studies have already been used in making decisions about the structure and content of ICD-11. If clinical utility is indeed among the highest goals of diagnostic systems for mental disorders, as the developers routinely claim, future revision efforts should continue to build on those efforts.

511,Develop an intervention to encourage youth participation in asthma review consultations with practice nurses,"OBJECTIVE: This article is the report of a study to develop an evidence-based pre-consultation guide for youth to use before an asthma review with a practice nurse. BACKGROUND: The participation of young people aged 13-19 in consultations with health professionals may be limited due to lack of opportunity to learn appropriate skills in tripartite consultations. Evidence-based interventions have been developed to encourage adult participation in consultations, but the needs of young people have not been specifically addressed. DESIGN: Guideline-informed multi-method design for the development of complex interventions. METHODS: A preliminary consultation guide for young people was developed in 2007 by applying a model of health behavior change, developing criteria by an expert panel, and consulting young people using a nominal group technique. RESULTS: The concepts of the Health Action Process Approach model were applied to the development of criteria supporting pre-consultation guidance. In the nominal groups, young people agreed that they had different needs than other children and adults. There was consensus that the pre-consultation guide should include disease-specific information, realistic photographs rather than Clip Art, consistent fonts, bullet points and colours, short vocabulary, and mature language. The evidence-based guide included statements and sample questions written by young people. CONCLUSION: Young people's views can contribute to the development of interventions designed to promote communication in consultations with nurses. This approach has the potential to be used to develop interventions in primary and secondary care in a variety of long-term conditions.",0,0,

The Healthy People 2000 goals aim to reduce tobacco use in high-risk populations such as teenagers and pregnant women. This article describes health professionals' guidelines for smoking cessation when working with pregnant adolescents and young mothers who smoke."";"" PIP: This article examines key components of smoking cessation and health promotion interventions for pregnant and parenting adolescents. It also explains health professionals' guidelines for smoking cessation when working with pregnant adolescents and young mothers who smoke. Both pregnancy and tobacco use are increasing among adolescents in the United States. The evidence clearly shows that smoking among pregnant adolescents is even higher than the national rate. Among pregnant teens, such a habit presents an immediate risk to the fetus, as well as a broad risk for the teen to form established smoking habits. Quitting smoking during pregnancy can have a profound effect on reducing infant mortality. For this purpose, it is suggested that health professionals can have a positive impact on the health of mothers, babies and children by encouraging and supporting the efforts of young mothers to quit smoking. The practitioner is in a special position to provide this counseling during health surveillance visits. Overall, the intervention guidelines presented in this article can be used for school-based clinics with pregnant students and are easily implemented in private practice or hospital-based clinics.",0,0,
514,Developing internet-based health interventions: a guide for public health researchers and practitioners,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners interested in developing online health interventions often rely on Web-based and print resources to guide them through the online intervention development process. While useful for understanding many aspects of website development best practices, what is missing from these resources are concrete examples of online intervention development experiences for health practices from the perspective of those conducting online health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to serve as a series of case studies in the development of online health interventions to provide insights to researchers and practitioners considering technology-based interventional or programmatic approaches. METHODS: A convenient sample of six study coordinators and five principal investigators at a large US-based land-grant university was interviewed about the process of developing online interventions in the areas of alcohol policy, adolescent health, medication adherence, and human immunodeficiency virus prevention. in transgender people and men who have sex with men. Respondents were asked questions that comprehensively covered each of the four phases of the User-Centered Design Process Map from the US Department of Health and Human Services' Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Qualitative codes were developed for all transcripts using line-by-line open coding, and all transcripts were independently coded by at least 2 authors. Differences between encoders were resolved by discussion. RESULTS: We identified the following seven themes: (1) hire a strong (or at least the right) research team, (2) take the time to plan before starting the design process, (3) recognize that vendors and researchers have different values, goals, and language, (4) develop a detailed contract, (5) document all decisions and development activities, (6) use a content management system, and (7) allow extra time to test and debug your response. Each of these areas is discussed in detail with supporting citations from the principal investigators and study coordinators. CONCLUSIONS: Consideration should be given to the values held by members of each participating organization involved in the development of the online intervention or program, as well as the goals sought to be achieved by the website. These defined values and goals should initiate a frank and open discussion about the scope of work, budget, and other needs from each organization's point of view. Because of the complexity of developing online interventions, researchers and practitioners should be familiar with the process and how this process may differ from the development and implementation of face-to-face interventions or programs. To assist with this, the response team should consider expanding the team to include specialists in computer science or learning technologies, as well as leveraging the institutional resources that will be needed for successful completion of the project. Finally, we explain the balance between the funds available for online intervention or program development and the complexity of the project.",0,0,
515,Developing leadership capacity for guideline use: a pilot cluster randomized control trial,"IMPORTANCE: The importance of leadership in influencing nurses' use of clinical guidelines is well documented. However, little is known about how to develop and evaluate leadership interventions for guideline use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to pilot a leadership intervention designed to influence nurses' use of guideline recommendations when caring for patients with diabetic foot ulcers in home care nursing. This article reports the feasibility of implementing the study protocol, research findings on nursing process outcomes, and leadership behaviors. METHODS: A mixed methods pilot study was conducted with only a post-cluster randomized controlled trial and descriptive qualitative interviews. Four units were randomized to either control or experimental groups. Clinical and management leadership teams participated in a 12-week leadership intervention (workshop, teleconferences). Participants received summarized chart audit data, set goals for change, and created a team leadership action. Criteria for assessing the feasibility of the protocol include: design, response, precautions, and data collection procedures. For the experiment, chart controls compared differences in nursing process outcomes. PRIMARY RESULT: 8-item nursing assessment score. Secondary outcome: 5-item nursing care score based on change goals set by intervention participants. Qualitative interviews identified leadership behaviors that influenced guide use. CONCLUSIONS: Conducting this pilot demonstrated that some aspects of the study protocol were viable, while others needed further development. Trial findings observed no significant difference in primary outcome. A significant increase in the 5-item score selected by the intervention participants was observed (p = 0.02). In the experimental group, mostly relationship-oriented leadership behaviors, supervision and feedback and reminders were defined as leadership strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a leadership intervention has the potential to affect nurses' use of guideline recommendations, but more work is needed to improve the intervention and outcome measures. A classification of leadership behaviors has been proposed to inform future research.",0,0,

517,Developing team leadership to facilitate guide use: planning and evaluating a 3-month response strategy,"BACKGROUND: Research identifies leadership as important to use. Yet interventions to develop current and future leaders for this purpose are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning and evaluation of a leadership intervention to facilitate nurses' use of guideline recommendations for diabetic foot ulcers in home health care. METHOD: Planning the intervention involved a synthesis of theory and research (qualitative interviews and table checks). One workshop and three follow-up teleconferences at two facilities were given to nurse managers and clinical leaders (n=15) in charge of 180 staff nurses. The evaluation included workshop questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: The highest scoring intervention components (four-point scale) were: setting target indicators (mean 3.7) and developing a team leadership action plan (mean 3.5). The pre-workshop barriers assessment scored the lowest (average 2.9). Three months later, participants reported that their leadership performance had changed as a result of the intervention, they interacted more with staff and were clear about their implementation goals. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICES FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Creating a team leadership action plan to operationalize leadership behaviors can help provide evidence-based care. Accessing clinical data and understanding team leadership knowledge and skills prior to formal training will assist nursing management in tailoring intervention strategies to identify needs and gaps.",0,0,

519,Development and implementation of a medical oncology quality improvement tool for a regional community oncology network: Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners initiative,"Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners (FCCCP) is a community hospital/academic partnership of 25 hospitals in the Delaware Valley. Originally created in 1986, the FCCCP promotes quality community cancer care through education, quality assurance, and access to clinical trial research. An important aspect of quality assurance is the annual medical oncology audit, which benchmarks quality indicators and guidelines and provides a roadmap for quality improvement initiatives in the community oncology clinical office setting. Each year, the FCCCP team and Associate Medical Oncologists create disease site- and stage-specific indicators based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Compliance with multiple indicators is assessed on 20 charts from each community application. A report for each FCCCP medical oncology practice summarizes documentation, screening recommendations, new drug use, and research trends in a particular disease region. Descriptive statistics reflect indicators met, number of new cases per year, number of disease site cases from tumor registry information, and clinical trial accrual total. Training and documentation tools are provided to physicians and oncology office nursing staff. The FCCCP Clinical Operations Team, made up of medical oncologists and oncology certified nurses, has conducted quality audits in medical oncology offices for 7 years using indicators derived from the NCCN. Successful audits involving gastric, colorectal and breast cancer have been the focus of recent reviews. For the 2005 stage II/III breast cancer assessment, the mean agreement per parameter was 88%, and 15 of 16 treatments had mean agreement above 80%. A large-scale quality assurance audit can be conducted in a community cancer partner network. Recent assessment of localized breast cancer demonstrates a high level of compliance with guidelines and identifies areas of focused education.

520,Development and implementation of a program to assess medical patients' need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Aim. Describes the development and implementation of a program to assess medical patients' need for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. Summary. The departments of pharmacy services, medicine, and information services at Hartford Hospital collaborated to create a program to improve VTE prophylaxis in medical patients. After evaluating compliance with baseline VTE prophylaxis, departments developed an intervention consisting of a message to be displayed to providers using the institution's computerized prescriber-order-entry (CPOE) system as a reminder to assess the current patient for VTE risk factors. and the need for VTE prophylaxis. The message was displayed when a patient met predefined criteria for VTE risk factors. The message would not continue to be displayed when there is an active order for mechanical or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in the patient's drug profile. Comprehensive training on the program was provided to hospital staff, pharmacists, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses. The program was implemented on a pilot medical floor in March 2007. A retrospective table review was conducted using the risk assessment tool developed to measure the impact of the program. The compliance rate for VTE prophylaxis after administration was 93% compared to 49% at pre-administration of the program (p < 0.001). Before the program, only 25% of patients with contraindications to pharmacological therapy received mechanical prophylaxis, compared to 100% after program implementation. Solution. The use of message alerts through a CPOE system and an interdisciplinary team approach to assess patients' risk of VTE have been shown to improve the use of VTE prophylaxis in medical patients.",0,1,
521,Development and implementation of non-pharmacological protocols for the management of Alzheimer's disease patients and their families in a multiethnic primary care setting.,"OBJECTIVE: Most patients with dementia and their families are cared for in primary care clinics. These clinics are rarely designed to provide the necessary comprehensive care. The purpose of this article is to describe non-pharmacological protocols for the management of Alzheimer's disease patients and their families implemented as part of a multi-faceted care management intervention program in a multiethnic primary care clinic. DESIGN AND METHODS: The non-pharmacological component for the integrated collaborative care program was developed based on literature review and previous clinical experience. Care is coordinated by a geriatric nurse who meets with patients, their families, and primary care physicians. Non-pharmacological protocols included general educational guidelines on Alzheimer's disease. Special protocols have also been developed to treat common behavioral disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease. An important component of the intervention is a monthly psychoeducational support group for caregivers. RESULTS: The intervention was well received by patients, families, and doctors. About half of the treatment group attended the support group regularly. APPLICATIONS: The integration of behavioral interventions and team care in the primary care setting has been successful.",0,0,

523,Developing a behavior change intervention: a case study on the practical application of theory,"BACKGROUND: The use of theory in the practice of complex interventions is widely recommended. To improve self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) in primary care, a complex trial intervention needed to be implemented in the Managing Osteoarthritis in Consultations (MOSAICS) trial. One component of the trial intervention was the delivery of an enhanced consultation for patients with OA by general practitioners (GPs). The purpose of our case study is to describe the systematic selection and use of theory to develop a behavior change intervention to implement the GP presentation of enhanced consultation. METHODS: Four theoretical models/frameworks guided the development of behavior change intervention: i) applying a model of change to guide the overall approach, ii) The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify relevant determinants of change, iii) a model to address identified determinants of behavior change and iv) principles of adult learning. Methods and measures were identified to assess the impact of the behavior change intervention. RESULTS: Behavior change intervention presented GPs with a well-defined proposition for change""; addressed seven TDF domains (eg, knowledge, skills, motivation, and goals); ten behavior change techniques (eg, persuasive communication);"" and delivered in workshops that value the expertise and professional values of GPs. Using a mix of interactive and didactic sessions, the workshops were facilitated by opinion leaders and used 'contextual communication skills training'. The methods and measures chosen to evaluate the behavior change intervention included: satisfaction assessment from workshops, GP intent to practice report, and assessment of GPs video-recorded consultations with patients with OA. CONCLUSIONS: A stepwise approach to the development of a behavior change intervention using theoretical frameworks to identify determinants of change matched with behavior change techniques has allowed for the systematic and theory-based development of an intervention designed by GPs to enhance consultations for: patients with OA. The success of the behavior change intervention in practice will be evaluated in the context of the MOSAICS research as a whole and will inform the level of practice and understanding of patient outcomes in the trial.",0,0,
524,Development of a complex intervention for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care using the UK Medical Research Council framework,"OBJECTIVE: To apply the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of trials of complex interventions for a primary care intervention to promote secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. STUDY DESIGN: Intervention development case report. METHODS: First, the literature on secondary prevention and lifestyle change was reviewed. Second, a preliminary intervention was modeled based on literature findings and focus group discussions with patients (n = 23) and staff (n = 29) from 4 general practices. Participants' experiences and attitudes towards key intervention components were investigated. Third, the pre-intervention was pilot-tested in 4 general applications. After delivery of the pilot intervention, practitioners evaluated the training sessions and qualitative data on their intervention experience were collected using semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 10) and patient focus groups (n = 17). RESULTS: The literature review identified 3 intervention components: a structured recall system, practitioner education, and patient information. Initial qualitative data identified variations in recall system design, training requirements (drug prescribing, facilitating behavior change), and information available to prospective study participants. Identifying the detailed structures within the intervention components clarified how the intervention could be tailored to the individual practice, practitioner, and patient needs while maintaining the theoretical functions of the components. Findings from the pilot phase informed further modeling of the intervention, reducing administrative time, increasing the practical content of training, and omitting unhelpful patient information. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the MRC framework helped determine the feasibility and development of a complex intervention for primary care research.",0,0,
525,Development of a complex intervention to promote appropriate prescribing and drug intensification in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in Irish general practice,"Background Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be viewed as failure to meet recommended targets for the management of key risk factors, including glycemic control, blood pressure and lipids. Poor control of risk factors is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. When noted, failure to intensify drugs for patients with poor control of T2DM is referred to as clinical inertia and is a contributing factor to poor control of T2DM. We aimed to develop a complex theory and evidence-based intervention to improve appropriate prescribing and drug concentration in poorly controlled T2DM in Irish general practice. Methods Used the first phase of the Medical Research Council Framework to develop and evaluate complex interventions. To identify the available evidence, we conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled T2DM in community settings. The Behavior Modification Wheel theoretical approach was used to identify appropriate intervention functions. Workshops, simulation, collaborations with academic partners, and physician observations were used to operationalize response functions and design elements of the complex response. Conclusions Our systematic review highlighted that professional-based interventions, potentially through clinical decision support systems, could address poorly controlled T2DM. Appropriate intensification of anti-glycemic and cardiovascular medications by general practitioners (GPs) for adults with poorly controlled T2DM was identified as a key behavior to address clinical inertia. Psychological ability was the key driver of behavior that needed to be changed, and he proposed five key intervention functions (education, training, activation, environmental restructuring, and encouragement) and nine key behavior modification techniques that are operationalized in a complex response. The intervention has three components: (a) training program/academic elaboration of the target GPs, (b) a remote discovery tool to help GPs identify patients with poor T2DM control in their practice, and (c) a web-based clinical decision support system. Conclusions This article describes a multifaceted process that includes a thorough theoretical understanding of the predictors of behavior that results in the design of a complex intervention to promote the search for available evidence and the application of evidence-based guidelines in adverse situations through appropriate prescribing and drug intensification. controlled T2DM",0,1,
526,Development of a minimization tool for the allocation of a hospital-level performance improvement intervention to reduce waiting times in Ontario emergency departments,"Background Rigorous evaluation of an intervention requires that its allocation be neutral with respect to the confounders; this is particularly difficult in complex, system-wide health interventions. We developed a short survey tool to identify factors for a minimization algorithm for the allocation of a hospital. Leveled intervention to reduce ED wait times in Ontario, Canada Methods Potential confounding factors affecting the success of the intervention were identified by literature review and grouped according to stages of change specific to the healthcare setting. International multidisciplinary (clinical, administrative, decision) constructive, management) panel evaluated these factors in a two-stage modified delphi and nominal group process based on four areas: readiness for change, evidence base, face validity, and clarity of definition. The panel narrowed the list to 12 in the first round of polls. survey, experts scored each factor according to four areas; summary scores and consensus discussion resulted in the final selection and measurement of four hospital-level factors to be used in the minimization algorithm: improved patient flow as a hospital's leadership priority; physicians' openness to organizational change; “efficiency of bed management” and physician incentives that support the goal of change. Conclusion We have developed a simple tool designed to collect data from senior hospital managers on factors that may influence the success of a hospital patient flow improvement intervention. A minimization algorithm will ensure balanced allocation of the intervention for these factors in research hospitals.",0,1,
527,Development of a tool to measure clinical competence in occupational therapy: a pilot study?,"Clinical competence is often defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and professional behavior. It is generally assessed using written tests, direct observation, chart audits, customer satisfaction surveys, and supervisor ratings. This article describes the development and evaluation of a chart-evoked recall (CSR) measure that combines schedule control and clinician interview methods to assess the clinical competence of practicing occupational therapists. The CSR tool was developed using the Canadian Guidelines for Client-Centered Practice and draws on global competence areas: theory use, assessment, program planning, intervention, discharge planning, follow-up, program evaluation, clinical reasoning, and professional behavior. This pilot study involved two independent evaluators/interviewers evaluating twelve occupational therapy clinicians on two occasions, using a random client case/registration sample at a time. in various application environments as a global measure of on-the-job performance.",0,0,

529,Development of an ICF-based clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of function in head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: Functional outcome following head and neck cancer is not regularly evaluated in a standardized manner in clinical practice. Clinical trials evaluating functional outcome apply many different tools. Therefore, results are not always comparable and have limited clinical implications. The purpose of this study was to describe, interdisciplinary evaluation and recommendation of functional outcome tools for use in clinical practice and clinical trials in patients with HNC. MATERIAL: The preparatory work produced a shortlist of outcome tools based on predetermined criteria. An interdisciplinary group of experts evaluated these tools and decided which ones could be recommended for use in 3 fields of application: screening, therapy evaluation/planning, and clinical trials. Health professionals who made the decision included physicians (ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, radiotherapists, oncologists), medical psychologists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, and social workers. RESULTS: 98 instruments were presented at the consensus conference. In total, 21 participants suggested a set of key measures to assess impairment in 6 functional areas for each of the 3 practice areas: follow-up treatment monitoring, pain, swallowing, voice/speech, other organic problems, and psychosocial problems. CONCLUSION: A multiprofessional pool of experts discussed and accepted recommendations for the use of functional outcome tools in clinical practice and/or research.

530,Development of clinical practice guidelines for the nursing care of persons exposed to percutaneous coronary interventions: Australian and New Zealand collaboration.,"OBJECTIVE: This article describes the development of nursing practice guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) supporting PCI nursing care are limited. METHOD: Health and medical practice development guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) were used for the guideline development process. A panel of experts (clinicians and consumers) attended a consensus conference to review the available evidence. Then, the opinions of the nurses were determined through an online questionnaire. This was followed by a modified Delphi method used to develop a set of draft guides over two rounds. RESULTS: 41 participants (39 cardiovascular nurses and 2 consumer representatives) attended the consensus conference. Eight additional members joined the panel for modified Delphi tours, with 27 participants completing the online survey. The final guidance document consisted of 75 recommendations. Approval was then sought from the most important cardiovascular organizations in Australia and New Zealand. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Inconclusive evidence precludes definitive recommendations. Therefore, consultation and consensus are essential in developing guidelines for achieving standardized nursing care and monitoring outcomes. PRACTICES FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a crucial role in PCI care, but there are currently limited guidelines to inform practice.

531,Development of geriatric competencies for emergency medicine residents using an expert consensus process,"BACKGROUND: The rate of emergency department (ED) visits for elderly patients exceeds all age groups except infants. The aging population will increase elderly emergency room patient use to between 35% and 60% of all visits. Older patients may have complex clinical presentations and may be resource intensive. Evidence suggests that emergency physicians are unable to provide consistent high-quality care for elderly emergency room patients, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The goal was to develop a consensus document called ""Geriatric Competencies for Emergency Medicine Assistants"" by designated specialists. This is the minimum set of behaviorally-based performance standards that all residents should be able to demonstrate by completing their specialist training. METHODS: This consensus-based process used an inductive, qualitative, multi-stage method to determine the minimum geriatric competencies required by emergency medicine (EM) residents. Face validity and reliability assessments were used throughout the project. RESULTS: In Phase I, participants (n=363) identified 12 domains and 300 potential competencies. In Phase II, a panel of experts (n=24) aggregated Phase I responses, resulting in eight domains and 72 competencies. III. In Phase 1, the expert panel narrowed the qualifications down to 26. IV. Analysis of face validity and reliability yielded 100% consensus for eight domains and 26 competencies. Areas identified, atypical presentation of disease; trauma, including falls; cognitive and behavioral disorders; emergency response changes; medication management; care transitions; pain management and palliative care;"" and the impact of comorbid conditions.

532,"Development, implementation and evaluation of a pharmacy-based model of asthma care","BACKGROUND Pharmacists are uniquely placed in the healthcare system to address critical issues in the management of asthma in the community. Several programs have demonstrated the benefits of a pharmacist-led asthma care program”, although such a program has not been previously evaluated in Australia. OBJECTIVE To measure the impact of a specific asthma service delivered through community pharmacies from an objective patient clinical, humanistic, and economic outcome METHODS 52 intervention patients and asthmatics A parallel-controlled design was used in which 50 control patients were recruited at 2 separate locations In the intervention area, pharmacists were trained and an asthma care model was implemented with 3 follow-ups Upstream visits over 6 months This model was evaluated based on clinical, humane, and economic outcomes compared between and within groups RESULTS 2.6 Â± 0.5 to 1.6 Â± 0.7 (mean Â± SD;"" p < 0.001) in asthma severity in the intervention group versus 2.3 Â± 0.7 to 2.4 Â± 0.5. In the intervention group, peak flow indices increased from 82.7% ± 8.2% at baseline to 87.4% ± 8.9% (p < 0.001) at the last visit, with a significant reduction in the defined daily dose of albuterol used by. patients ranged from 374.8 Â± 314.8 Âµg at baseline to 198.4 Â± 196.9 Âµg at last visit (p < 0.015). There was a statistically significant improvement in perceived asthma control and asthma knowledge scores in the intervention group compared to the control group between baseline and last visit. Based on overall severity reduction, savings of $132.84 (AU) per patient per year in drug costs and $100,801.20 for the entire group were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, it appears that a specialized model of asthma care offers community pharmacists an opportunity to contribute to improving asthma management in the Australian community.",0,1,
533,Diabetes in rural towns: effectiveness of continuing education and feedback for healthcare providers in changing diabetes outcomes at the community level: protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases internationally. Health complications associated with type 2 diabetes can be prevented, delayed or improved through early detection and effective management. This research primarily aims to examine the impact of a web-based educational intervention on diabetes care provided by rural general practitioners (GPs) and subsequent patient outcomes. A population-level approach is used for outcome assessment, through de-identified pathology records for the entire city. METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a set of randomized controlled trials with rural populations as the unit of analysis. Towns from four Australian states were selected and matched based on factors such as rurality, population size, proportion of the population that are Indigenous Australians, and socio-economic status. Eleven town pairs from the two states were eligible for the trial, and one town from each pair was randomized to the experimental group. Training on diabetes care best practices through an online active learning module, access to targeted and expert advice via an online request form, and town-based performance feedback on diabetes monitoring and outcomes to GPs in cities allocated to the experimental group. The package is delivered via repeated direct mail. DISCUSSION: The benefits of the results of the study are explained along with the difficulties and limitations of the methodology.

535,Diabetes nurse case management and motivational interviewing for change (DYNAMIC): Study design and key features in a Chronic Care Model for Type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Despite the evidence that diabetes is costly and devastating, the health system is poorly equipped to meet the challenges of chronic disease care. The Penn State Institute of Diabetes and Obesity is evaluating a type 2 DM management model that includes nurse case management (NCM) and motivational interviewing (MI) to promote behavior change. The primary care intervention is designed to improve patients' self-care and reduce clinical inertia through provider use of standard clinical guidelines to achieve better diabetes outcomes. METHODS: This RCT tests the efficacy of an enhanced NCM intervention on patient outcomes with type 2 DM (n=549) mediated by changes in self-care behavior and diabetes management. Outcomes include: (a) impact on clinical parameters such as HbA1c (<7), BP (<130/80) and LDL (<100), depression scores and weight; (b) process measures such as complication screening; (c) patient psychological and behavioral outcomes as measured by emotional distress (PAID), diabetes-specific quality of life (ADDQoL), patient satisfaction (DTSQ), self-care activities (SDSCA), and (d) physician satisfaction and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: Baseline includes (mean) age=58; BMI=34.4; 57% female;"" 47% Caucasian and 39% Hispanic. Patients had elevated HbA1c (8.4), BP (137/77), and LDL (114). Overall, patients were depressed (CES-D=21.6) and had an extremely negative life (ADDQoL=-1.58) We believe that enhanced NCM will both improve self-care and reduce emotional distress in patients with diabetes.

537,Diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"PURPOSE: The purpose of this NIH Consensus Statement is to inform the biomedical research and clinical practice communities about the results of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The disclosure provides the latest information on effective treatments for ADHD and presents the conclusions and recommendations of the consensus panel on these issues. Additionally, the statement identifies areas of study that deserve further research. Upon completion of this educational activity, the reader should have a clear working clinical knowledge of the latest in this topic. The clinician target audience for this statement includes, but is not limited to, psychiatrists, family physicians, pediatricians, internists, neurologist psychologists, and behavioral medicine professionals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were a non-Federal, non-advocacy, 13-member panel representing the fields of psychology, psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, epidemiology, biostatistics, education, and the public. In addition, 31 experts from the same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 1215 people. EVIDENCE: Literature was searched on Medline and a comprehensive reference bibliography was provided to the panel and conference audience. Experts prepared summaries with relevant quotations from the literature. Scientific evidence was prioritized over clinical anecdotal experience. CONSENT PROCESS: By answering predefined questions, the panel developed its conclusions based on scientific evidence and scientific literature presented in the open forum. The panel created a draft statement, which was read in full and circulated to experts and audiences for comment. Subsequently, the panel resolved conflicting recommendations and issued a revised paper at the end of the conference. The panel finalized the revisions a few weeks after the conference. The draft paper was made available on the World Wide Web soon after its publication at the conference and has been updated with the panel's latest revisions. CONCLUSIONS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD is a commonly diagnosed childhood behavioral disorder and represents a costly major public health problem. Children with ADHD have marked impairments and may experience long-term adverse effects on academic performance, professional success, and social-emotional development that have a profound impact on individuals, families, schools, and society. Despite progress in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD, this disorder and its treatment, particularly the use of psychostimulants for both short-term and long-term management, remains controversial. Although there is no independent diagnostic test for ADHD, there is evidence to support the validity of the disorder. More research is needed on the dimensional aspects of ADHD and the comorbid (co-existing) conditions present in both its childhood and adult forms. Studies involving randomized clinical trials (primarily of short duration, approximately three months) demonstrated the effectiveness of stimulants and psychosocial treatments for alleviating ADHD symptoms and associated aggression, and demonstrated that stimulants are more effective than psychosocial therapies in treating these symptoms. Due to the lack of consistent improvement beyond baseline symptoms and the paucity of long-term studies (beyond 14 months), longer-term studies with drugs and behavioral modalities and their combinations are needed. Although trials are ongoing, definitive recommendations for long-term treatment cannot be made at this time. There is wide variation among communities and physicians in the use of psychostimulants, suggesting that there is no consensus on which ADHD patients should be treated with psychostimulants.

Data Source: MEDLINE search (January 1966 - September 2001) examination of patients with low back pain for clinical and radiographic accuracy articles and reviews. Study Selection: Authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles for review based on a combined judgment. Data on clinical examination were primarily based on recent systematic reviews""; data on imaging tests were primarily based on original articles. Data Extraction: Diagnostic results were drawn by one or the other author. The quality of methods was informally evaluated. Major potential biases were identified, but quantitative data extraction or No scoring was performed. Data Synthesis: No formal meta-analysis was used because of heterogeneity in diagnostic hardware and software, gold standards, and patient selection methods and the small number of studies. magnetic resonance imaging (0.83 to 0.93) and radionuclide scanning (0.74 to 0.93) 0.98) for the highest;"" Specificity was highest for magnetic resonance imaging (0.9 to 0.97) and radiography (0.95 to 0.99). Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive (0.96) and specific (0.92) test for infection. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for herniated discs was slightly higher than for computed tomography but very similar for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Conclusions: The data suggest a diagnostic strategy similar to the 1994 Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines. Symptomatic treatment without imaging is appropriate for adults younger than 50 years of age with no signs or symptoms of systemic disease. Plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic diseases in patients aged 50 years or older or whose findings suggest systemic disease. Further imaging should be reserved for patients considering surgery or with a strong suspicion of systemic disease.",0,0,
540,Dietary treatment of hypercholesterolemia: Do dietitians do it better? A Randomly Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommend initial dietary counseling by physicians for most patients with hypercholesterolemia"";"" Referral to a registered dietitian and lipid-lowering medications are recommended only for patients who remain hypercholesterolemic. We evaluated the increased value of detailed nutritional counseling by dietitians when added to general nutritional advice provided by physicians. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Hypercholesterolemic patients identified during a cholesterol screening project were randomly assigned to receive dietary counseling by a physician only (70 patients) or by a physician and a registered dietitian (66 patients). Patients were observed for 1 year to determine compliance with NCEP guidelines. RESULTS: At 3 months, the mean (+/- SD) decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was 7% +/- 11% in the physician group and 12% +/- 10% in the dietitian. group (P < 0.004). A 10% or more reduction in LDL cholesterol was observed in 25 patients (36%) in the physician group and 43 patients (65%) in the dietitian group (P<0.001). Only 40 (29%) of patients in both groups achieved their NCEP target goals at 3 months. Most of these were low-risk patients with a 160 mg/dL LDL cholesterol target target. At 12 months, both groups lost about half of the beneficial effects on LDL cholesterol levels, and the difference between the two groups narrowed. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term reduction in LDL cholesterol level obtained after counseling by dietitians is superior to that achieved by physicians. However, long-term adaptation remains insufficient. For patients at high risk, a more aggressive dietary approach and possibly earlier administration of lipid-lowering drugs should be considered.",0,0,

542,Distinguishing normal speech fluency from stuttering in children,"The concept of stuttering means that a speech pattern is not fluent or hesitant. It is reported that the incidence is 1% worldwide and it is more common in men than women (3:1). Theories of causation are briefly described, including genetic predisposition and neurological factors. In the process of acquiring speaking skills, preschoolers normally go through the transitional stage of speech fluency. This fact can hinder recognition of early stuttering behavior, be emotionally painful for the child, and hinder his psychological development. The healthcare provider is in a key position to provide early diagnosis and intervention to the child presenting with early stuttering. In order to do this, the healthcare provider must have the knowledge and skills to distinguish normal developmental fluency from early stuttering. Factors that differentiate these speech patterns are identified, along with guidelines for referral. Current treatment methods used by speech pathologists are described. Practical interventions that can be offered to parents to increase the child's speech fluency and reduce speaker anxiety are summarized.",0,0,
543,Challenges in implementing a mental health guide: an exploratory study using psychological theory.,"BACKGROUND: Evaluations of interventions to improve the implementation of guidelines have failed to produce a clear pattern of outcomes that supports a particular method. Although practice depends on clinicians and managers changing various behaviors, psychological theories of behavior and behavior change are rarely used to try to understand the challenges in practice or to develop interventions to overcome them. OBJECTIVES: This study applied psychological theory to examine explanations of difficulties in practice. He used a theoretical framework derived from an interdisciplinary consensus study to code the interviews across 11 theoretical domains. The focus of the study was the Schizophrenia guideline recommendation of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence that family intervention should be offered to families of patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Participants were recruited from community mental health teams” from three UK National Health Service (NHS) Foundations; 20 members (social workers, nurses, team managers, psychologists and psychiatrists) participated. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded and Interview questions covered in theoretical areas and addressed the respondents' knowledge, attitudes, and opinions about the guideline. Two researchers independently coded the transcript sections related to each theoretical area from each interview. A score of 1 indicated that the transcript sections related to the area did not appear to include a description of difficulties in applying family therapy guidelines. Similarly, 0.5 points indicates probable difficulties and 0 points definite difficulties. RESULTS: Coding of respondents' answers to questions about 'beliefs about outcomes', 'social/professional role and identity' and 'motivation', factors related to these domains creating difficulty show that the probability is low n produced the three highest overall scores. in practice. 'Environmental context and resources' was the lowest rated, while 'Emotion' was the second lowest rated, suggesting that these are probably areas where intervention should be considered. The two main resources identified as problems were time and education. The emotions that appeared to potentially influence the family therapy offering were self-doubt and fear. CONCLUSION: This exploratory work illustrates an approach to developing a theoretical understanding of implementation challenges.",0,0,

547,Distinctive patterns of human immunodeficiency virus risk in healthy young adults,"Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of current methods for identifying individuals at high risk for contracting and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk reduction strategies. We review our research on sexual decision-making by young adults using theories and methods from the social and cognitive sciences. Four condom use patterns and associated risk and belief levels were determined. These models offer value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different risk levels. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the healthcare system and may be in the best position to screen individuals at risk. Given the time demands and other barriers, there is a need for easy-to-use, evidence-based guidelines for this type of screening. We recommend such guidelines for primary care physicians to use in determining an individual's risk, and from these guidelines personalized intervention strategies can be developed.",0,0,

549,Withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors: results of a survey of Canadian dementia experts,"BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are increasingly used for longer periods of time, even in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. Practices can vary widely as there is little data available to help clinicians decide when it is safe and appropriate to discontinue ChEIs after prolonged use. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted with Canadian dementia specialists (geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians) involved in clinical trial studies. Recommendations for discontinuing ChEI were determined based on responses to questions about patient/caregiver preference, administrative considerations, efficacy, and adverse events. RESULTS: There was a reasonable consensus that ChEIs should be discontinued based on patient and caregiver preference and in the presence of serious bothersome adverse events. There was much less consensus on issues of effectiveness—especially what the larger-than-expected decline was. There was a general reluctance to rely on any single measure of cognition, function, and/or behavior, and in particular, the MMSE appeared to be useless in deciding whether to continue. CONCLUSION: Recommendations for discontinuation of ChEIs after prolonged use derived from a survey of dementia specialists are presented. Ideally, clinical practice guidelines based on controlled release trials are needed.",0,0,
550,Discussing randomized clinical trials of cancer therapy: Evaluation of the Cancer Research UK education program,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention aimed at improving communication among healthcare professionals about randomized clinical trials with cancer patients. DESIGN: Before and after the evaluation of the training program. SETTING: Members of the National Cancer Research Network, Scottish Trials Network and Cancer Research Network Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 101 healthcare professionals (33 clinicians and 68 research nurses). INTERVENTION: Four module arms delivered by a trained facilitator using interactive exercises and videotapes covering the general topics of discussion of randomized clinical trials with patients, problems specific to adjuvant trials, trials in which palliation is the goal, and trials in which patients strongly prefer a treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the intervention, participants were videotaped discussing an experiment with an actor portraying a patient. These consultations were evaluated for the availability of information required by good clinical practice guidelines. Player patients made an assessment after each interview. Participants reported their self-confidence about key aspects of the essay discussion. RESULTS: Analysis of video-recorded consultations, significant communication after intervention such as significantly more participants explaining randomization (69 vs. 81, odds ratio 2.33, P = 0.033), checking patients' understanding (11 vs. 31, odds ratio 3.22). demonstrated the behavior. , P = 0.002) and standard treatment (73 vs 88, odds ratio 4.75, P = 0.005) and side effects (69 vs 85, odds ratio 3.29, P = 0.006). Participants' self-confidence increased significantly in all domains (P < 0.001). Player patients' ratings of participants' communication showed significant improvements for the 12/15 core item. CONCLUSION: This 8-hour intensive intervention significantly improved participants' confidence and competence when communicating about randomized clinical trials.",0,0,
551,Discussion of sexual risk behavior in HIV care is rare and appears to be ineffective: a mixed-methods study,"Consensus guidelines in HIV care require clinicians to provide a brief sexual risk behavioral intervention at each visit. Research based on participant reports finds this to occur rarely, but studies based on direct observation of clinical encounters are lacking. We conducted a mixed-method study using audio recordings of 116 routine outpatient visits by 58 different patients with HIV in five different practices. Transcripts of visits were coded and analyzed using a quantitative system. We also made a qualitative analysis of the dialogue sections in which sexually risky behaviors came to the fore. The sexual risk behavior discussion took place over 10 visits and was generally fairly short-lived. Important counseling on sexual risk reduction was given in two visits"";"" the other two contained important discussions that were not explicitly directed at the patient's changing behavior. At seven additional visits, clues emerged suggesting a need or opportunity for such a discussion that doctors did not follow. Interactions related to sexual risk had less patient involvement than interactions related to other health behaviors. Physicians rarely provide sexual risk reduction counseling in HIV care, even when specific indications are available.",0,0,

553,Dissemination of effectiveness and outcome research,"Efficacy and outcome research aims to improve patients' health outcomes by improving the quality of health care they receive. The dissemination of the findings of such studies is a necessary step in this process. This article reviews what is known about the design and dissemination of effective information packages for healthcare providers (primarily doctors) where effectiveness is meant to promote behavior change for practitioners that leads to better patient care. Research information about practice is communicated to providers through the publication of results from randomized clinical trials, dissemination of consensus recommendations, the development and use of computer-based aids in clinical decision making, and the provision of continuing medical education. Each of these areas provides numerous examples of the extremely modest behavioral response that can be expected from the mere provision of information. The literature also offers some principles that may increase the chances of success, including the desirability of techniques involving face-to-face interaction, encouraging active student participation, repetition of the message, and making recommendations clear and relevant to clinical practice. benefit from opinion leaders and peer influence. Little fundamental research has been done on providers' motivations and actual decision-making processes. Research aimed at advancing the behavioral science of providers can also provide new insights into effective dissemination strategies.",0,1,
554,Dissemination of Evidence-Based Antipsychotic Prescribing Guidelines to Nursing Homes: A Cluster Randomized Study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to translate and disseminate evidence-based guidelines on atypical antipsychotic use to nursing homes (NHs). DESIGN: Three-arm, cluster randomized trial. SET: NH's. PARTICIPANTS: NHs in the state of Connecticut. MEASUREMENTS: Evidence-based guidelines for atypical antipsychotic prescribing were translated into a toolkit targeting NH stakeholders, and 42 NHs were recruited and randomized to one of three toolkit dissemination strategies: toolkit delivery by mail (minimum density); quarterly inspection and toolkit delivery by mail. and feedback reports on facility-level antipsychotic prescribing (moderate intensity);"" and face-to-face toolkit delivery that includes academic elaboration, on-site behavioral management training, and quarterly audit and feedback reports (high-intensity). Results were evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RESULTS: The toolkit of leadership of 30% (7/23) of low-density NHs, 54% (19/35) of medium-density NHs, and 82% (18/22) of high-density NHs reflected awareness, adoption, and implementation of the intervention. . The highest levels of use and knowledge among direct care personnel were reported in high-density NHs. Antipsychotic prescribing levels fell over the study period, but there were no statistically significant differences between study arms or secular trends. CONCLUSION: RE-AIM indicators show some success in dissemination of the toolkit and differences in access, adoption and practice according to the dissemination strategy, but no measurable effect on antipsychotic prescribing trends. More information may need to be provided to external stakeholders such as psychiatric counselors and hospitals to influence antipsychotic prescribing for NH residents.",0,1,
555,Do decision support systems affect the difference in prescription?,"BACKGROUND: Translating scientific evidence into daily practice is problematic. Any intervention strategy using educational and/or guiding strategies aimed at changing behavior has evolved, but has only been partially successful. This article focuses on (computerized) decision support systems (DSSs). KDSs interfere with physicians' daily routines, as opposed to interventions aimed at influencing knowledge to change behavior. We examined whether general practitioners (GPs) prescribe according to recommendations given by DSS and whether there is less variation in prescription when DSS is used. METHODS: Data were used from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP2) collected in 2001. A total of 82 diagnoses, 749811 contacts, 133 doctors and 85 practices were included in the analyses. General practitioners using DSS daily were compared with general practitioners not using DSS. Multilevel analyzes were used to analyze the data. Two outcome measures were chosen: whether the prescription complied with the DSS recommendation and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a concentration measure. CONCLUSIONS: GPs who use DSS daily write more prescriptions than GPs who do not use DSS, according to the recommendations given in DSS. Contrary to our expectation, there was no significant difference between HHIs for both groups: variation in prescription was comparable. CONCLUSION: We examined the use of a DSS for drug prescribing in general practice in the Netherlands. DSS is based on guidelines developed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners and implemented in GPs' Electronic Medical Systems. GPs using DSS write prescriptions more frequently based on the recommendations given in DSS than GPs not using DSS. However, this finding does not mean that variation is lower"";"" The variation is the same for GPs using and not using DSS. The conclusions of the study are that DSSs can be used to apply guidelines, but variation should not be expected to be limited.",0,1,
556,Do Health Reforms Affect Health Professionals' Cost Awareness? Results of a Nationwide Study in the Balkans,"BACKGROUND: Serbia, the largest market in the Western Balkans, has entered the socioeconomic transition with a significant lag compared to most of Eastern Europe. Health system reform efforts have been bold over the past 15 years, but their results have been inconsistent in several areas. The two waves of global recession that hit the Balkan economies were ultimately reflected in the health care finances. Serious difficulties have become real in providing citizens with accessible medical care. A large part of the intolerable expenses actually belong to the various laboratory and imaging diagnostic procedures demanded by physicians with overt drug prescription. Therefore, a large national survey was conducted at all levels of the health system hierarchy to discern the ability of cost containment strategies to reshape clinician mindsets and decision-making in practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the judgments of health professionals about the economic consequences of prescribed medical interventions and their response to policy measures aimed at raising cost awareness. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 2010 to April 2013, before and after policy action, through the hierarchy of medical facilities in various geographic regions. In the middle of the observed period, the National Health Insurance Fund (RFZO) took serious cost containment measures. Independently, pharmacoeconomic guidelines targeting prescribers were distributed. Management in large hospitals and community pharmacies had to restrict access to high-budget medical care. The Economic Awareness Questionnaire of Healthcare Professionals-29 (EAHPQ-29) developed in Serbian was used in face-to-face interviews. The survey documented clinician's attitudes on: Clinical Decision Making Between Alternative-Interventions (CDMAI), Quality of Health Care (QHC), and Cost Containment Policy (CCP). The authors randomly and anonymously recruited 2000 healthcare professionals and provided a total of 1487 responses""; after missing questionnaires were eliminated, 649 participants were evaluated before the policy intervention and 651 after. RESULTS: Dentists (1.195+/-0.560) had a higher CDMAI score. The surgical group had a higher overall EAHPQ-29 score, CCP score, and CDMAI score compared to the internist group (1.017+/-0.453). Policy intervention had a statistically significant negative effect on the QHC score (F=4.958 ; df=1; "" p=0.027). Policy interventions had no significant impact on professional behavior and judgment in relation to CDMAI, CCP, and overall EAHPQ-29 scores. CONCLUSION: Although cost savings were enforced in practice, their impact on clinical decision making was modest. Clinicians' perceptions of the quality of medical care were explained less effectively because of the severely limited resources allocated to providers. This pioneering effort in the Balkans demonstrates the inadequacy of current policies to broaden clinicians' cost awareness.",0,0,
557,Do information brokers facilitate the implementation of stroke guidance in clinical practice?,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of clinical practice guidelines in rehabilitation practice is often cumbersome and incomplete. One intervention to improve the implementation of the guidelines is the knowledge transfer program built around the activities of a knowledge broker (KB). This study explores the use of KBs to implement guideline recommendations for post-stroke intensive therapy and physical activity in 22 stroke patients. Units in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. METHODS/DESIGN: This study includes a pre-intervention uncontrolled design and mixed methods process evaluation and a quantitative evaluation. Enterprising nurses and therapists from each stroke unit will be recruited and trained as KB. KB will work on its team for one year to implement the guideline recommendations. A questionnaire will be administered to patients, healthcare professionals, and BPs at baseline (T0) and one year later (T1) to assess the effectiveness of BP. In addition, semi-structured interviews will be held with 5 KB in T1. The primary outcome of this implementation project will be support for healthcare professionals to exercise and be physically active for patients, as reported by patients and healthcare professionals themselves. The support immediately after the intervention is compared to the support at the beginning of the intervention. Additionally, we will explore the impact of health professionals' socio-demographic characteristics and determinants (intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived) identified in the Planned Behavior Theory. behavioral control) is about the change of supportive behaviors of health professionals. Finally, PDs will fill out a questionnaire about their psychological and social demographics and the organizational conditions required for health care improvement, such as time, workforce, sponsorship and support from management. DISCUSSION: With this study, we will have an idea about when and why information brokers are effective. We will also identify predictors of which healthcare professionals are likely to change their behavior. This study will guide how to apply the guidelines and help improve stroke rehabilitation services.",0,0,
558,Do nurses have a different physical health profile? A systematic review of experimental and observational studies on nurses' physical health.,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence on nurses' health. OBJECTIVE: Nurses are one of the most important resources of a health system. They are exposed to biological, socio-economic, cultural and health system factors that determine their health. Although mental and physical health problems seem to be common among nurses, the literature is often contradictory. The literature on nurses' health styles, health behaviors and health perceptions is also not clear. DESIGN: A systematic review of experimental and observational studies on nurses' health. METHODS: Forty-three databases were searched. 2692 references identified as potential areas of interest"";"" 187 studies were included. Only results from studies on physical health are presented. No meta-analysis was possible. The Scottish Interuniversity Guidelines Network system was used to rank the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses were at greater risk of musculoskeletal injury and more prone to blood-borne pathogen infections than other healthcare workers. They had a higher risk of breast cancer than other female healthcare professionals. Nurses in hospitals were more at risk of tuberculosis. Overall, there was no risk of excess cancer, Hodgkin's disease, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreatic, ovarian, kidney, brain, or thyroid cancer, or lymphosarcoma. They have a higher prevalence of occupational allergies than office workers. DISCUSSION: Nurses suffer more from musculoskeletal disorders in accordance with the nature of the nursing job. Especially if they work in lung, medical or Human Immunodeficiency Virus services, they are at higher risk of contracting tuberculosis, which can result from repeated contact with infected patients. Nurses are also more prone to blood-borne pathogen infections, which can be explained by exposure while working. The susceptibility to occupational allergies can be explained by exposure to a range of chemicals. RELATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is not possible to develop specific occupational health programs without sound knowledge of nurses' health.",0,0,
559,Do pediatricians apply the 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux after receiving training?,"BACKGROUND: According to a recent study, the 2009 North American Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition-European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines for gastroesophageal reflux are not adequately followed by European primary care pediatricians. The main issue that emerged from the survey was the unnecessary prescription of acid-suppressing drugs, especially in infants. There was no investigation into its causes. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the guidelines in European primary care pediatricians with specific training. METHODS: One hundred pediatricians who participated in the previous survey agreed to participate and were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group trained on guidelines via an online podcast and the other group trained via a summary. During the following 3 months, each pediatrician involved was asked to register each consecutive infant, child, or adolescent with obscene reflux symptoms. Pediatricians filled out a report on diagnosis and treatment options for each registered patient. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients (boys/girls 186/196, infants/children/adolescents 194/123/65) were enrolled by pediatricians. Infants with unexplained crying and/or distressed behavior who were given proton pump inhibitors were 3.7% (P < 0.05) compared to 45.2% of pre-training survey data. Infants with uncomplicated recurrent regurgitation and vomiting who were prescribed proton pump inhibitors were 4.5% versus 37.1% of baseline survey data (P < 0.05). The overall proportion of children managed in full compliance with guidelines was 46.1% after education compared to 1.8% before education (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between pediatricians from the podcast and synopsis group. CONCLUSIONS: The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition-European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition gastroesophageal reflux guidelines currently have good applicability, although poorly followed by European primary care pediatricians. Simple, inexpensive training has been proven by pediatricians to be effective in increasing compliance. The increase in compliance clearly supports the role of continuing medical education through simple educational tools and subsequent practice evaluation.",0,1,
560,Does polypillary lifestyle lead to neglect of risk factors? Findings from an individual participant data meta-analysis among 3140 patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether polypill-based care for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is associated with a change in lifestyle risk factors compared with usual care in patients with CVD or high estimated cardiovascular risk. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of individual participant data from three studies involving patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand, comparing a strategy using a polypill containing aspirin, statins and antihypertensive therapy with regular care. those at high risk for a previous CVD event or initial event. The analyzes looked for any differential effects on anthropometric measures and the person's reported lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: Among 3140 patients (75% male, mean age 62 years and 76% with prior CVD event), there was no difference in lifestyle risk factors for those randomized to polypill-based therapy compared to usual care for a median of 15 months, either all combined. among participants or within a number of subgroups. Also, narrow confidence intervals (CIs) excluded any significant effects"";"" for example, differences between groups in body mass index were -0.1 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.1) kg/m(2), duration of moderate-intensity physical activity per week was -2 (-26 to 23) minutes, and the proportion was 16% for smokers at the end of the trial. versus 17% (RR 0.98, 0.84 to 1.15). CONCLUSION: This analysis addresses the concern that polypill-based care may lead to neglect of lifestyle risk factors, at least in high-risk patients. Maximally effective preventive approaches should address lifestyle factors alongside pharmaceutical interventions, as recommended by major international guidelines.",0,0,
561,Documentation-based clinical decision support to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Background and purpose Clinical guidelines do not recommend prescribing antibiotics for many acute respiratory tract infections (ARI), especially for appropriate non-antibiotic diagnoses. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support has the potential to improve antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. Methods We randomly assigned 27 primary care clinics to receive or provide usual care – the EHR-integrated, documentation-based clinical decision support system – the ARI Smart Form – for the care of patients with ARI. The primary outcome was the rate of prescribing antibiotics for ARIs in an interventional analysis based on administrative diagnoses. Results During the intervention period, patients made 21 961 ARI visits to study clinics. Intervention clinicians used the ARI Smart Form in 6% of 11 954 ARI visits. The rate of prescribing antibiotics in intervention clinics was 43% versus 39% in control clinics (odds ratio (OR), 0.8""; 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted for clustering by clinic 0.6_1.2). Antibiotic prescribing rate for appropriate ARI diagnoses was 54% in intervention clinics and 59% in control clinics (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5_1.3). (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6_1.4) When the ARI Smart Form was used, the rate of antibiotic prescribing was 49% based on diagnoses entered in the form, overall, 88% for antibiotic-appropriate diagnoses and 27% for non-antibiotic appropriate diagnoses. In one analysis used, the ARI Smart Form was associated with a lower rate of antibiotic prescribing for acute bronchitis (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3_0.8). Results The ARI Smart Form neither reduced overall antibiotic prescription nor significantly improved the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, but it is not widely used. When using the ARI Smart Form, it can improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the prescription of antibiotics for certain diagnoses compared to administrative diagnoses.",0,1,
562,Does collaborative development and dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines improve prescribing behavior: a pre/post study and randomized trial with concurrent control group,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to maintain control over prescribing behavior in general practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the dissemination strategy of multidisciplinary guidelines on the volume of drug prescribing. METHODS: The study included two designs, a quasi-experimental pre/post study with a concurrent control group, and a randomized GP sample within the intervention group. The intervention area with 53 GPs was compared with a randomly selected control group of 54 GPs in the south and center of the Netherlands. In addition, a randomization was performed in the intervention group to create two arms, with 27 GPs more heavily involved in the development of the guideline and 26 GPs in the control group. A multidisciplinary committee developed prescription guidelines. These guidelines were then distributed to all GPs in the intervention area. Additional effects were examined in the subgroup study, in which GPs were invited to participate more intensively in the guideline development procedure. The guidelines included 14 recommendations on antibiotics, asthma/COPD medications, and cholesterol medications. The main outcome measures were prescription data over a three-year period (one year before and 2 years after guideline release) and rate of change from recommendations. RESULTS: Significant short-term improvements were seen for one recommendation: mupirocin. Long-term changes in cholesterol drug prescriptions have been found. No additional changes were seen in the subgroup for the randomized controlled trial. Family physicians did not accept the invitation to participate. CONCLUSION: The dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines developed in a region does not have a clear impact on prescribing behavior, although GPs and specialists are more heavily involved in their development. It seems that more effort is needed to bring about change.",0,0,563.0

564,Does methadone maintenance therapy based on new national guidelines work in primary care?,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are being encouraged to treat more drug users, but there are few studies demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients continue methadone maintenance therapy for one year in a modern British primary care setting with prescribing protocols based on new national guidelines, using objective outcome measures to determine if they can achieve harm reduction results similar to those shown in other settings. available. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Primary Care Clinic for Drug Addiction, Sheffield. METHODS: The intervention consisted of a methadone maintenance therapy provided by GPs with prescribing protocols based on 1999 national guidelines. The first 96 consenting patients were included in the treatment"";"" Completed 65 studies. Outcomes were current drug use, HIV risk-taking behavior, social functioning, criminal activity, and mental and physical health, supported by urinalysis and criminal record data. RESULTS: Heroin use frequency ranged from 3.02 episodes per day (standard deviation [SD] = 1.73), mean 0.22 episodes per day (SD = 0.54), (chi 2 = 79.48, degrees of freedom [df] ] = 2, P < 0.001), confirmed by urinalysis. The average number of convictions and strikes for all offenses was reduced by 62% (z = 3,378, P < 0.001). HIV risk-taking behavior, social functioning, and physical and psychological well-being all showed significant improvements. CONCLUSION: Patients who continue methadone maintenance therapy in primary care for one year can generally achieve a range of harm reduction outcomes similar to those shown in studies in other higher-structured programs.",0,0,
565,Does Publication Bias Inflate the Apparent Effectiveness of Psychological Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of US National Health Funded Research Institutes,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of antidepressant drugs has been shown to be empirically overestimated due to publication bias, but this has been statistically excluded only for the psychological treatment of depression. We directly evaluated the extent of study publication bias in studies examining the effectiveness of psychological treatment for depression. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified US National Institutes of Health grants awarded during 1972–2008 to fund randomized clinical trials comparing psychological treatment with control conditions or other treatments in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder and determined whether these grants led to publications. . For unpublished studies, data were requested from researchers and included in meta-analyses. Thirteen (23.6%) of the 55 funded grants that started trials did not result in publication and the other two never started. Between comparisons with control conditions, adding unpublished studies (Hedges' g = 0.20""; CI95% -0.11~0.51; k = 6) to published studies (g = 0.52; 0.37~0.68; k = 20) reduced the psychotherapy effect size score (g = 0.39;"" 0.08~0.70) estimate 25%. Furthermore, because outcome reporting bias cannot be quantified, these findings may overestimate the ""true"" effect of psychological treatment for depression. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of psychological interventions for depression has been exaggerated in the published literature, just as in pharmacotherapy. Both are effective, but not to the extent suggested by the published literature. Funding organizations and journals should archive both original protocols and raw data from treatment trials to allow detection and correction of outcome reporting bias. Clinicians, guideline developers, and decision-makers should be aware that the published literature overestimates the effects of dominant treatments for depression.",0,0,
566,Does screening and intervention for multiple health-compromising behavioral and mental health disorders among young people presenting to primary health care improve health outcomes? a systematic review,"AIM: Adolescence and young adulthood are important developmental periods. Screening for health-threatening behaviors and mental health disorders during routine primary care visits has the potential to help clinicians identify areas of concern and provide appropriate interventions. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore whether screening and subsequent interventions for multiple health-compromising behaviors and mental health disorders in primary care settings improve youth health outcomes. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a literature search was conducted using search terms representing four thematic concepts in the Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases (Prospero registration number CRD4201305828): primary care, youth, screening and mental health and health-compromising behavior. To be eligible for inclusion, studies: ""include a measure of health outcome; include at least 75% of participants under the age of 25; use a screening tool that assesses multiple health domains;"" and should be conducted in a primary care setting. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Rating Scale. RESULTS: Of the 5051 identified articles, nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one pilot RCT, two clustered RCTs, one randomized study with multiple intervention groups and no control group, one cluster RCT with two active arms. , a longitudinal study and a preliminary study. Seven studies, including two RCTs and one clustered RCT, found positive changes in substance use, diet, sexual health or risky sexual behavior, alcohol-related risk behavior, social stress, stress management, helmet use, sleep, and exercise. One of only two studies reporting harms reported that increased alcohol use was an adverse health outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that the use of youth screening and intervention for mental health disorders or health-compromising behaviors in clinical settings improves health outcomes. Along with other evidence that teens value discussing health risks with their providers, these discussions should be part of teens' routine primary care. More quality studies are needed to strengthen this evidence.",0,0,
567,Does shared care help treat depression?,"INTRODUCTION: Shared or Collaborative Care in the treatment of depression is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to be more effective than the usual general Practitioner in the treatment of depression, but is not yet Government policy in the UK. We aimed to bring together all the studies conducted up to mid-2009 in one place to show the evidence that joint collaborative care has significant advantages in both depression outcomes and cost benefits. Adoption of this approach in the UK and n Europe. METHODS: We conducted a literature review using PUBMED to identify and describe all trials, systematic reviews, and Metaanalyses conducted on shared care up to mid-2009. In the late 1990s he engaged in development and work activities in Luton. We excluded articles describing trials that have not yet been performed and instead focused on reported trials. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous recent studies have shown shared care in the treatment of depression, which includes the training of General Practitioners in the treatment of depression and the provision of a Nurse in Primary Care or another professional to perform psychotherapy. education ensures compliance with drug therapy and can provide psychotherapy, leading to both improved treatment outcomes and increased physician and patient satisfaction, and also provides some cost-benefits despite somewhat increased immediate costs. This is true in both adult and adolescent patients, whereas depression improves in diabetic patients, although there is no improvement in glycemic control. The joint care intervention remains beneficial in patients with persistent depressive symptoms, but in such cases a longer input will be required. Patients with sub-threshold depression would not see as much benefit, and patients expressed greater satisfaction when psychological interventions were offered. It is also a condition in which collaborative or shared care is effective in treating depression in the elderly. This has also been demonstrated in studies of elderly patients, the poorer, those with suicidal ideation, as well as Ethnic Minorities, who also suffer from multiple health conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD. CONCLUSION: The results described above are mostly based on studies conducted in the USA, but similar studies have been reported from the UK and are consistent with the service experience in Luton that we have described. Based on these results, it is seen that collaborative care, shared with primary and secondary health care doctors (General Practitioners and Psychiatrists) as part of a single team, with the help of affiliated mental health practitioners in primary care, but with easy access to health services, is important. Second-line care is an efficient way to optimize depression treatment. In the UK, however, it has not yet been possible to develop such a service for the entire population. This is because in the UK General Practice is managed by Primary Care Trusts and Secondary Care, including Psychiatry, by Mental Health Trusts. This has prompted the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed local care commissioners, to focus on the Cascading Model for depression treatment; A key issue is access to secondary care (or referral) and discharge back to primary care. focuses on facilitating (or keeping doors on) these processes, rather than focusing on truly optimizing the outcomes of care with a group of Mental Health professionals. CONCLUSION: Evidence advocates the development of collaborative care between primary and secondary care for the treatment of Depression. This will require common medication guidelines in both Primary and Secondary Care, easy access for Practitioners to get advice about patients from Psychiatrists, and the use of Mental Health Professionals to provide patients with psychoeducation, adherence support and psychotherapy. . To achieve this, services may need to be restructured to allow easy communication between professionals.",0,0,
568,"Does therapeutic writing help people with long-term conditions? Systematic review, realistic synthesis and economic considerations","BACKGROUND: Writing therapy to improve physical or mental health can take many forms. The most researched model of therapeutic writing (TW) is unfacilitated, individual expressive writing (written emotional disclosure). Streamlined writing activities are less explored. DATA SOURCES: Databases searched from baseline to March 2013 (updated January 2015), including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. REVIEW METHODS: Four TW practitioners provided expert advice. Working procedures were conducted by a reviewer and checked for a second. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized comparative studies were included. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Non-facilitated and facilitated TW studies are analyzed separately under the chapter titles International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.2.6 where available (RevMan 2012, The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Costs were estimated from the UK NHS perspective and three cost-outcome case studies were prepared. Realist synthesis followed the Realist and Meta-narrative Synthesis of Evidence: Emerging Standards guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of TW for individuals with long-term conditions (LTCs) compared to any paper or other controls, reporting any relevant clinical results. Carrying out a realistic synthesis to understand how and for whom TW can work. RESULTS: From 14,658 unique citations, 284 full-text articles were reviewed and 64 studies (59 RCTs) were included in the final efficacy reviews. Five studies that facilitated TW were reviewed"", which were highly heterogeneous with unclear or high risk of bias, but suggested that facilitated TW interventions may be beneficial in individual LTCs. Non-facilitated significant typing was reviewed in 59 studies of variable or unreported quality. Overall, very Little or no evidence of any benefit in the following conditions (number of studies): human immunodeficiency virus (six), breast cancer (eight), gynecological and genitourinary cancers (five), mental health (five), asthma (four) ); psoriasis (three) and chronic pain (four) There was a reduction in disease severity in inflammatory arthropathies (six) [n = 191, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.96 to - 0.26] short term in a meta-analysis of four studies No or sparse or inconsistent data for all other LTCs Unfacilitated emotional writing, short (n = 1563, SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.17, forward significant heterogeneity) or long-term (n = 778, SMD -0.04 95% CI -0.18 to 0.18) depression. 0.10, small heterogeneity) follow-up or anxiety, physiological or biomarker-based outcomes. One study reported cost, no study reported cost-effectiveness, and 12 studies reported resource utilization,” and the meta-analysis suggested that drug use decreased but had no effect on health center visits. Estimated intervention costs were low, but there was insufficient evidence to judge cost. -efficacy Realistic synthesis findings suggested that facilitated TW is a complex intervention and group interaction contributes to perceived benefit. It was not clear from the available data who could benefit most from facilitated TW. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is little evidence to support the therapeutic efficacy or cost-effectiveness of unfacilitated meaningful writing interventions in people with LTCs. More research focusing on facilitated TW in people with LTCs may be informative. : This work is registered as PROSPERO CRD420120033. 43.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Manual search of journals and electronic databases, conference proceedings, and bibliographies through April 2006""; contacts with dressing manufacturers for unpublished studies. STUDIES REVIEWED All randomized controlled trials evaluating dressings for venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. Data from eligible studies , extracted and summarized independently by two reviewers using a data extraction sheet Methodological quality assessed independently by two reviewers RESULTS Search strategy identified 254 studies, 42 of which met inclusion criteria Hydrocolloids were no more effective than simple low-adhesive dressings used under compression (eight trials; 'relative risk for healing with hydrocolloid 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.28). For other comparisons, insufficient evidence was available to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. None of the dressing comparisons showed evidence that a particular class of dressing healed more ulcers. There were some differences between dressings in subjective outcome measures and ulcer healing rates. The results were not affected by the size or quality of the studies or the randomization unit. Insufficient data were available to allow conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of different dressings. CONCLUSIONS The type of dressing applied under compression has not been shown to affect ulcer healing. The results of the meta-analysis showed that application of hydrocolloid dressings under compression provided no benefit in terms of ulcer healing compared to application of simple low-adhesive dressings. No firm recommendation can be made as to which type of dressing is the most cost-effective. Decisions about which dressing to apply should be based on the local costs of dressings and the preferences of the practitioner or patient.",0,0,
571,"Driving simulators for occupational therapy screening, assessment and intervention","Simulation technology provides reliable, objective and repeatable performance measures of operational (for example, avoiding a collision) or tactical (for example, lane maintenance) driver behavior. Many occupational therapy researchers and others use driving simulators to test various applications in different populations. A growing body of literature provides support for the relationships between simulated driving and real road driving. One limitation of simulator technology is the occurrence of simulator disease, but management strategies exist to reduce or mitigate its onset. Based on the literature review and a consensus process, five consensus statements are presented to support the use of driving simulation technology among occupational therapy practitioners. Evidence suggests that occupational therapy practitioners can use driving simulators to identify underlying impairments in driving performance, identify driving errors in at-risk drivers; can distinguish the driving performance of disabled and healthy control groups; alleviates the onset of roadworks and simulator sickness. Much progress has been made among occupational therapy researchers and practitioners in the use of driving simulation technology; however, empirical support is needed to further justify the use of driving simulators in clinical practice settings as a valid, reliable, clinically useful and cost-effective tool for driving assessment and intervention.",0,0,

574,Medication use and the role of patients and prescribers,"Research methods need to be expanded to move towards rational drug use in any national or local setting. Both the public and private sectors should be addressed. In the second, the pharmacists, the audience, can be studied using an imaginary customer. Drug knowledge, an important factor influencing prescribing, has rarely been scientifically evaluated. However, experimental studies using group randomization are possible even in developing countries. The focus of drug research should be on individuals as individuals, and health and wellness should be at the forefront. The combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will help us achieve rational drug use that is culturally acceptable, economically viable, and pharmacologically sound.""; PIP: In an effort to improve rational drug use in local or national settings, particularly in developing countries, the behavior of prescribers and users is the most It is the subject of little research. The effectiveness of drugs depends on a complex set of factors related to prescribing and purchasing status. One issue that needs to be examined is the information provided to prescribers by drug advertisers and detailers. A shortcoming that has been addressed by an international network of prescribers. In many countries, drugs The biggest outlet for pharmacies is private sector pharmacies, where drugs are often dispensed without a prescription. A simple and inexpensive way to study prescription behavior is to use phantom trackers to track case management of specific conditions such as infant diarrhea There are many factors involved in the prescription ;"" The process should be studied with an epidemiological approach, namely through identification, analysis, intervention and evaluation. Standardized treatment programs, essential drug lists, treatment guidelines, and targeted intervention should be overseen by local therapeutic committees. Pharmaceutical information should also be evaluated scientifically with the same analytical principles. The experimental method of group randomization is recommended as a viable choice for developing countries. In this technique, groups of doctors are observed or interviewed and quantitative outcome data are collected.

An example of a challenge with this approach is the possible use of shorter courses of antibiotic therapy to reduce the risk of developing resistant organisms.",0,0,
575,MEDICINE system that increases the adherence of Chinese surgeons to antibiotic use guidelines in the perioperative period,"OBJECTIVE: The irrational use of antimicrobial agents to prevent postoperative SSIs is a common phenomenon in China, resulting in greater bacterial resistance, higher nosocomial infection rates, and the extra costs of antimicrobial agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the Rational Drug Use Guidelines System (DRUGS) on the surgeon's antimicrobial agent prescribing behavior. METHODS: Ten common surgical operations including 1543 cases (778 cases using paper-based guidelines and 765 cases using MEDICINE) were selected and demographic and clinical data were collected. Selected operations are thyroid resection, breast mass resection, myomectomy etc. includes. Evaluation criteria were antibiotic administration categories, starting dose, duration of administration, length of stay, antibiotic costs, SSIs, and drug adverse events (ADRs). . RESULTS: Antimicrobial agents were mostly administered 0.5 to 2 hours before the incision, 656 patients (85.75%) were treated with MEDICINE and 256 (32.90%) patients were treated with paper-based guidelines according to the protocol. For clean wound incision, 547 patients (91.62%) were within 24 hours of discontinuing antibiotics when paper-based guidelines were used, while 91 patients (14.79%) were using DRUGS. A total of 19 types of antibiotics were used in 1543 cases. Piperacillin and sulbactam sodium, cefatiamidine and cefoperazone took the first three places in the frequency list. After the intervention, the frequency list was changed to cefazolin, cefatiamidine, and cefoperazone. Mean length of stay in hospital was (7.00+/-4.31)d with paper-based guidelines and (2.54+/-1.57)d with DRUGS, respectively. The average cost of antibiotics in paper-based guidelines was yen(3481.36+/-2584.46) and MEDICINES and yen(1693.39+/-1478.27), respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of CAE and ADR between the two groups.

576,Lasting improvements in prostate cancer screening from online interval training in a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer is frequently performed in violation of clinical practice guidelines. BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that an email-based intervention called ""interval education"" could reduce clinicians' inappropriate screening for prostate cancer. DESIGN: The study was conducted as an RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study included 95 primary care clinicians at eight Veterans Affairs medical centers from January 2007 to February 2009. Intervention: Participants were divided into two cohorts: interval training clinicians received four isomorphic cycles of nine emails (zero) over 36 weeks. two e-mails a week), control clinicians did not receive any intervention. Each email presented a clinical scenario and asked if it was appropriate to have a PSA test. Participants received feedback immediately after submitting their responses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number and percentage of inappropriate PSA screening tests ordered. Inappropriate testing was defined as the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients >76 or <40 years of age. The suitability of the screening was divided into two according to the age of the patient at the time of screening. Patients undergoing PSA testing for non-screening reasons were excluded using a validated protocol. Adjusted logistic regression for patient clustering was performed by the clinician. Analyzes were made in 2009. RESULTS: Clinicians who received interval training emails during the intervention period (Weeks 1-36) requested significantly fewer inappropriate PSA screening tests than control clinicians (14.2% versus 10.5%, p=0.041). During the 72-week period following the intervention (Wks 37–108), interval training clinicians continued to order fewer inappropriate tests compared to controls (7.8% and 13.1%, p=0.011, respectively), resulting in a relative inappropriateness of 40%. represents the decrease. scanning.

577,Dynamic distribution of happiness in a major social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether happiness spreads from person to person and whether happiness niches are formed in social networks. DESIGN Longitudinal social network analysis. SET The Framingham Heart Study social network. PARTICIPANTS 4739 people were followed from 1983 to 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Happiness measured on a validated four-item scale"";"" broad features of social networks and their various social ties. RESULTS Clusters of happy and unhappy people can be seen in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends to three degrees (for example, a friend's friend's friend's). People who are surrounded by many happy people and are central to waxing are more likely to be happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness arise not simply from people's tendency to associate with similar individuals, but from the spread of happiness. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and is happy increases a person's probability of being happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1 to 57%). Similar effects are seen in spouses living in the same household (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings living within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next-door neighbors (34%, 7% to 70%). No effects are seen among co-workers. The impact diminishes with time and geographic separation. RESULTS People's happiness depends on the happiness of others they depend on.

578,"Dyslipidemia in primary care -- prevalence, recognition, treatment and control: data from the German Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Project (GEMCAS)","BACKGROUND: Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) define low thresholds for the diagnosis of dyslipidemia using total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide treatment. Although primarily a prevention tool, its thresholds are difficult to meet in clinical practice, especially in primary care. METHODS: We determined the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and control rates of dyslipidemia in a nationwide study of 1,511 primary care physicians and 35,869 patients. The diagnosis of dyslipidemia was based on TC and LDL-C. Basic descriptive statistics and prevalence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia was quite common in primary care (76% overall). 48.6% of male patients and 39.9% of female patients with dyslipidemia were diagnosed by doctors. However, lifestyle intervention controlled dyslipidemia in only 10% of patients. A higher proportion (34.1% of men and 26.7% of women) were controlled while receiving pharmacotherapy. The chances of being diagnosed and subsequently controlled with pharmacotherapy were higher in men (PRR 1.15""; 95% CI 1.12-1.17), in patients with concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with hypertension (PRR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37) and cardiovascular about the disease (PRR 1.46; 95% CI 1.29-1.64), previous myocardial infarction (PRR 1.32; 95% CI 1.19-1.47), and previous myocardial infarction if patients know or know they are hypertensive (PRR 1.18; 95% CI 1.04-1.34) ( PRR 1.17;""95% CI 1.23-1.53). CONCLUSION: The thresholds of ESC seem difficult to meet.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a leading global problem and nurses have an increasing role in weight management with patients. The literature has described a variety of theory-based behavior modification techniques that have successfully aided weight management in patients. Therefore, educating nurses in behavior modification techniques related to obesity is appropriate in preparing them for their future professional roles. However, the effectiveness of these educational interventions has yet to be evaluated. METHODS: Center for Review and Dissemination guidelines informed this systematic review. Four databases were systematically searched and articles were evaluated according to inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment forms were developed and completed to identify salient features in the articles. RESULTS: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. Only two, one of which was a randomized controlled trial, included both baseline and outcome measures. In addition, only one study included a clearly defined behavior modification technique. Interventions were performed by a range of methods, but quality assessment showed that all of the studies had poor methodologies and were at high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in this research area are sparse and methodologically inconsistent. Therefore, it is not possible to identify effective educational interventions for weight management for nursing students. APPLICATIONS: More robust research is needed to explore how nurses can be trained to facilitate weight management. Greater transparency in definitions of intervention, particularly what behavior modification techniques are taught, will allow for replication and appropriate evaluation. Until then, it was unknown whether current teaching adequately equips nurses to manage obese and overweight patients.",0,0,

However, in published studies, the definition of 'early' has varied (in terms of time, pain intensity, or presence of allodynia) or is unclear. Therefore, clear clinical indications have not been established. Appropriately designed essays to address this issue remain a priority. Early treatment with triptans can also have disadvantages, such as the inadvertent treatment of tension-type headaches and the danger of drug overuse.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in our understanding of treatments for eating disorders in adults, and especially pharmacological treatments for these disorders. Multiple double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of antidepressant medications in bulimia nervosa. While the benefit of pharmacological treatments for the acute treatment of anorexia nervosa is less clear, recent evidence suggests a role for the drug in preventing relapse.

588,Economic analyzes of the Be Fit Be Well program: a weight loss program for community health centers,"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force has published new guidelines on obesity, encouraging primary care physicians to provide intensive, multi-component behavioral interventions to obese patients. However, there are very few real-world studies of weight loss in non-academic primary care settings, and even fewer in largely racial/ethnic minority, low-income samples. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recruitment, intervention, and repeat costs of a 2-year, moderate-intensity weight loss and blood pressure control intervention. DESIGN: A comprehensive cost analysis associated with a weight loss and hypertension management program delivered at three community health centers as part of a pragmatic randomized trial was conducted. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty-five high-risk, low-income, inner-city, minority (71% Black/African-American and 13% Hispanic) patients who were both hypertensive and obese. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included total recruitment costs and intervention costs, cost per participant, and incremental costs per unit reduction in weight and blood pressure. KEY RESULTS: Recruitment and intervention costs for the 2-year program were calculated as $2,359 per participant. Compared with the control intervention, the cost per additional kilogram lost was $2,204/kg and for blood pressure $621/mmHg. Sensitivity analyzes show that if the program is presented to a larger sample and minor changes are made, the cost per participant can be reduced to the level of many commercially available products. RESULTS: The costs associated with the Be Fit Be Well program were found to be significantly more expensive than many commercially available products and much higher than what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid paid physicians for obesity counseling. However, given the serious and costly health consequences associated with obesity in high-risk, multimorbid, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, the resources needed to provide interventions such as those described here may still prove cost-effective in terms of producing long-term behavior change.",0,0,

Results The patients surveyed filled more than 2.05 million antihypertensive drug prescriptions in 2001 at an annual program cost of $48.5 million ($363 per patient). We identified 815 316 prescriptions (40%) in which an alternative regimen seemed more appropriate based on evidence-based recommendations. Such changes would have reduced the cost to payers by $11.6 million (about a quarter of the program spending on antihypertensive drugs) in 2001 and would have been more clinically relevant overall. Replacing calcium channel blockers resulted in the greatest potential savings. Using pricing limits similar to those in the Medicaid program could have resulted in even greater potential savings of $20.5 million (42% of program costs). Conclusions Adherence to evidence-based prescribing guidelines for hypertension can result in significant savings in prescription costs for elderly patients with hypertension, which will save approximately $1.2 billion nationally. Identifying similar areas where prescribing could be improved will be critical to the affordability of prescription drug benefit programs.",0,0,

593,Educational and organizational interventions to improve depression management in primary care: a systematic review.,"CONTEXT: Depression is common in primary care, but is often overlooked or poorly managed. A number of organizational and educational strategies have been proposed to improve depression management. The clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies have yet to be systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of organizational and educational interventions to improve depression management in primary care. DATA SOURCES: We searched electronic medical and psychological databases from inception to March 2003 (MEDLINE, PsycLIT, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Assessments Database, Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group register and Cochrane Influential Professional and Organizational Change Group expert registration)""; corresponded with authors;"" and the reference lists used. The search terms were related to depression, primary health care, and all guidelines and organizational and educational interventions. STUDY SELECTION: We selected 36 studies, including 29 randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled clinical trials, 5 pre- and post-controlled trials, and 2 interrupted time series studies. Results regarding the management and outcomes of depression were investigated. DATA DRAWING: Methodological details and conclusions were drawn and checked by 2 reviewers. Where possible, summary relative risks were calculated from the original data and attempts were made to correct for unit of analysis error. DATA SYNTHESIS: A narrative synthesis has been made. Twenty-one studies were found with positive results. Effective strategies for improving patient outcomes are often those with complex interventions that include clinician training, the enhanced role of the nurse (nurse case management), and a higher degree of integration (counsel-linkage) between primary and secondary care. Telephone medication counseling by practice nurses or trained counselors was also effective. Simple guide application and training strategies were often ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant potential to improve depression management in primary care. Commonly used guidelines and training strategies are likely to be ineffective. Applying the findings from this research will require substantial investment in primary health care and a major shift in the organization and delivery of care.",0,0,
594,Educational Intervention on Hepatitis B Vaccination Knowledge and Performance of Primary Care Assistants in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus,"OBJECTIVES: Although guidelines recommend hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization for adults with diabetes mellitus (DM), vaccination rates remain low. Our aim was to evaluate the knowledge and practices related to HBV and to evaluate the effectiveness of a versatile education program. METHODS: Primary care residents (n = 244) at three academic institutions were surveyed about various aspects of HBV. Residents in a training program were then randomly assigned to a training intervention (E) (n = 20) and a control group (C) (n = 19). Group E received periodic email reminders with a focused didactic lesson and immediate feedback. We compared the knowledge scores before and after the intervention. Chart inspections were carried out to assess the behavior of residents. RESULTS: A total of 103 people (42%) responded to the survey. The survey showed that residents lacked the necessary knowledge and risk assessment skills regarding HBV in patients with DM. In the controlled trial of intervention E, both groups had similar baseline knowledge scores. Group E showed a significant increase (65%"";"" P < 0.001) in knowledge scores immediately after intervention, from a mean of 29% at baseline to 70% (P < 0.001) maintained 6 months after intervention. In group C, 6-month post-intervention scores were not different from baseline (38% vs. 29%). No significant difference was observed in documentation skills. CONCLUSIONS: A combined education program was effective in increasing knowledge about HBV and vaccination in DM, but had limited impact on physician practice. More work is needed, including system changes with educational initiatives to improve clinical practice.",0,1,
595,Educational interventions for general practitioners to identify and manage depression as a suicide risk factor in youth: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health problem and is the second leading cause of death in young adults globally. Globally, there are 164,000 suicides per year among young people under the age of 25. Depression is a strong risk factor for suicide. Evidence shows that 45% of those who complete suicide, including young adults, contacted their general practitioner rather than a mental health professional one month before their death. More evidence suggests that risk factors or early warning signs of suicide in young people go unnoticed and untreated by GPs. Healthcare-based suicide prevention interventions targeting general practitioners are designed to increase the detection of at-risk youth. The rationale for this type of intervention is that early identification of individuals at risk and improved clinical management will reduce morbidity and mortality. This systematic review will synthesize the evidence for the effectiveness of education interventions for general practitioners in identifying and managing depression as a suicide risk factor in youth. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis following the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adhere to the reporting guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting recommendations. Electronic databases will be systematically searched for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies investigating the efficacy of general practitioner interventions in identifying and managing depression as a suicide risk factor in youth compared with any intervention, no intervention, usual care or waiting. list. Gray literature will be searched by scanning trial records. Only studies published in English will be included. No date restrictions will be applied. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of potential studies. The primary outcome is the identification and management of depression. Secondary outcomes were suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, intentional self-harm, knowledge of suicide risk factors and suicidal-related behaviors, attitudes toward suicide risk and suicidal-related behaviors, confidence in coping with suicide risk factors, and suicidal-related behaviors. CONCLUSION: Our study will inform the development of future educational interventions and provide evidence of feasibility and acceptability to help general practitioners identify and manage suicidal behavior in youth.

596,Educational interventions to improve the prescribing and dispensing of antibiotics: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics contributes to the increase of antibiotic resistance, which is an important public health problem. Strategies should be developed to improve antibiotic prescribing. Our aim is to review educational programs aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing by physicians and/or antibiotic delivery by pharmacists in both primary care and hospital settings. METHODS: We conducted a critical systematic search and review of the relevant literature published between January 2001 and December 2011 on educational programs aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing and dispensing practices in primary care and hospital settings. RESULTS: We identified 78 studies for analysis, 47 in primary care and 31 in hospital settings. Studies have reported mostly positive results, although they vary widely in design. Outcomes measured in the studies reviewed were adherence to guidelines, total or both of antibiotics prescribed, attitudes and behaviors related to antibiotic prescribing, and quality of pharmacy practice regarding antibiotics. Twenty-nine (62%) studies in primary care and twenty-four (78%) in a hospital setting reported positive outcomes for all measured outcomes”; fourteen (30%) studies in primary care and six (20%) in a hospital setting reported positive outcomes for some outcomes and for others, outcomes that were not statistically affected by the intervention; only four studies in primary care and one study in a hospital setting did not report significant post-intervention improvements for all outcomes. Behavioral changes related to antibiotic prescribing and improvement in the quality of pharmacy practice were observed in four studies and one study, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that antibiotic use can be improved with educational interventions, mostly multifaceted interventions.",0,0,
597,Educational visitation and hypnotic prescribing in general practice,"Public concern about prescribing hypnosedative drugs (mostly benzodiazepines) has led to a trial of a controlled educational intervention by general practitioners (GPs) to promote rational prescribing. This article describes the training intervention and process evaluation. In urban and rural New South Wales, 137 GPs were visited during office hours by a GP or pharmacist trained in communication skills. Materials available to GPs included a booklet of relaxation tapes and problem-focused management guides. The interview had three phases: alignment was achieved, then educational material was presented, and finally, the visitor sought physician approval to review five patients on long-term benzodiazepines. Visits were well received. Various measures have been created to reflect doctors' motivations and interests in non-drug therapy"";"" There was almost no relationship between any of these process measures and trial outcome: a change in prescribing behavior. Self-assessment of benzodiazepine prescribing greatly underestimated actual self-reported prescribing events. We interpret this as a reminder that we don't always do what we want to do and that we don't always do what we think we are doing.",0,0,
598,The effect of computerized body mass index system on diagnosis and treatment of adult obesity.,"Background: In obese adults, doctors often fail to detect obesity and prescribe treatment for it. We sought to determine whether requesting a computerized body mass index (BMI) chart would increase the likelihood that family physicians would refer patients for obesity diagnosis and treatment for obesity. Methods: A total of 846 obese patients from 37 family physicians were randomly assigned to either have a patient's BMI chart request placed in their electronic medical record (intervention group) or not have a BMI request in the registry (comparison group). . We then reviewed patient medical records for evidence of an obesity diagnosis and referral for specific obesity treatments. We also measured whether the presence of comorbidity in obese patients affects the likelihood of diagnosis and treatment by physicians. Results: Obese patients of physicians who had a BMI chart request in their medical record were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with obesity than obese patients from physicians who did not request a BMI chart (16.6% vs 10.7%"";"" P= .016). Patients of physicians who were given a BMI chart prompt were more likely to receive referrals for diet therapy (14.0% vs. 7.3%, P=0.002) and exercise (12.1%) than patients from doctors who did not receive a chart prompt. 7.1% versus P=.016). Of the obesity comorbidities, only obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicted that one patient was diagnosed with obesity (OR=.49, 95% CI=0.281, 0.869, P=.014). Conclusions: The inclusion of a computerized BMI chart prompt has increased the likelihood that doctors will diagnose obesity in obese patients and refer them to treatment.",0,1,
599,Effect of minimal pharmacy intervention in improving adherence to asthma guidelines.,"Purpose To examine the effectiveness of a minimal intervention strategy for improving compliance with pediatric asthma guidelines. Design and setting A group of pharmacists was encouraged to discuss key aspects of asthma management with their GPs they normally work with. Compliance with guidelines was assessed by examining prescriptions for children with asthma. We compared the treatment of children enrolled in participating pharmacies (intervention group) with a control group (reference group) enrolled in other non-participating pharmacies and the results of a previous study. Key outcome measures Number of children not using short-acting betamimetics, not using inhaled corticosteroids while using long-acting betamimetics, and having more than one type of inhaler. Results The number of children without short-acting betamimetics was significantly lower in the intervention group (176/1447 vs. 534/3527""; p<0.01), and fewer children did not have inhaled corticosteroids despite using long-acting betamimetics (6/219 versus 41). /477; p=0.03) The number of children with more than one type of inhaler was equal in both groups (5.1%), but significantly lower than in this previous study (239/3217 versus 119/2311; ""p<0.01). Conclusions Pharmacists' assistance in compliance with pediatric asthma guidelines is helpful. Pharmacists should be actively involved in the care of children with asthma.",0,1,
600,Effect of Web-Based Guided Self-Help Intervention on the Prevention of Major Depression in Adults with Sub-threshold Depression,"Significance Evidence-based treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are not very successful in improving functional and health outcomes. Attention has increasingly focused on the prevention of MDD. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based guided self-help intervention for the prevention of MDD. Design, Environment, and Participants A two-group randomized clinical trial conducted between March 1, 2013 and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited through a statutory health insurance company (ie co-employer funded insurance) larger than the general population in Germany. employee contributions). Participants consisted of 406 self-selected adults with sub-threshold depression (Central Epidemiological Studies Center Depression Scale score Â¡Ã 16, no current MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] criteria). Interventions All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (primary care clinician visits) or either a web-based guided self-help intervention (cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving therapy assisted by an online trainer""; n?= ?202) or a web-based psychoeducation program ( n?=?204) Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the time of onset of MDD during a 12-month follow-up period in the intervention group compared to the control blind diagnostic assessors using telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6 and 12 months follow-up. and included time to previous evaluation.

602,Effect of an outpatient antimicrobial management intervention on broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing by primary care pediatricians: a randomized trial.,"Importance Antimicrobial management programs have been effective for inpatients, often prescribing supervision and feedback. However, most antimicrobial uses occur in outpatients with acute respiratory infections (ARTIs). Purpose To evaluate the impact of an antimicrobial management intervention on antibiotic prescribing for outpatient pediatric patients. Design Cluster, randomized trial of outpatient antimicrobial management comparing prescribing between intervention and control practices using a common electronic health record. After excluding children with chronic medical conditions, antibiotic allergies, and pre-existing antibiotics, we estimated prescribing rates for targeted PLUS standardized for age, gender, race, and insurance from 20 months before to 12 months after intervention (October 2008-June 2011) . ).

604,"The effect of peer review, supervision, and feedback on general practitioners' prescribing and test ordering performance: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Most worldwide research focuses on controlling costs and better compliance with guidelines in healthcare. Research focused on professional behavior is usually conducted in a well-controlled research environment. In this study, a large-scale application of a peer review strategy was tested on both test ordering and prescribing behavior in primary care in the normal quality improvement setting. METHODS: We planned a cluster of RCTs in primary care existing local quality improvement collaborations (LQICs). The study lasted from January 2008 to January 2011. LQICs were randomly assigned to one of the two trial arms, and each arm received the same supervisory intervention and feedback along with peer review. Five different clinical subjects were presented in both arms and served as a blind control for the other arm. Differences in test ordering rates and prescribing rates between both arms were analyzed in an intent-to-post analysis and a per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one LQIC groups participated in the trial, including 197 GPs working in 88 practices. Treatment-directed analysis showed no difference in changes in test rank or prescribing performance between the intervention and control groups. Per-protocol analysis showed positive results for half of the clinical subjects. The increase in total tests ordered was 3% in the intervention arm and 15% in the control arm. For prescribing, the increase in prescriptions was 20% in the intervention arm and 66% in the control group. It was observed that the groups with the highest initial test order and prescription volume showed the greatest improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that results from previous studies cannot be confirmed by our attempt to implement the strategy in the field. We did not see a decrease in the volumes of tests ordered or drugs prescribed, but rather a lesser increase. In the Netherlands, it has proven impossible to implement supervision and feedback and peer review in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the Dutch trial register on 7 August 2007 with the number ISRCTN40008171.",0,1,
605,The effect of supervision and feedback and reminder messages on primary care radiology referrals: a randomized trial.,"Background Radiological tests are often used by general practitioners (GPs). These tests can be overused and contribute little to clinical management. In accordance with the UK Royal College of Radiologists guidelines on lumbar spine and knee radiographs, we aimed to evaluate two methods for reducing GP demands for radiological testing. Methods We evaluated supervision and feedback and educational reminder messages across six radiology departments and the 244 general practices they serve. The study was a pre- and post-pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial with a 2Â·2 factorial design. A random subset of GP patients' records were reviewed for compliance with guidelines. The main outcome measure was the number of radiograph requests per 1000 patients per year. The analysis was therapeutic. Results The effect of educational reminder messages (ie change in post-intervention request rate) was -1Â·53 (95% CI -2Â·5 to -0Â·57) and -1Â·61 absolute change for the lumbar spine. For (-2Â·6 to -0Â·62) knee radiographs, both are about 20% relative reduction. The effect of supervision and feedback was an absolute change from 0Â·04 (-0Â·95 to 1Â·03) to -0Â·07 (-1Â·3 to 0Â·9) for the lumbar spine, both relative reductions. is about 1%. The agreement between the groups did not differ significantly. Interpretation 6-month feedback of audit data is ineffective, but the routine addition of educational reminder messages to radiographs is effective and does not affect the quality of referrals. Any radiology department that handles primary care referrals can do well with this intervention.",1,1,
606,The Effect of Behavior Change on the Outcome in Early-Mid-stage Chronic Kidney Disease: A Cluster-Randomized Study,"OBJECTIVES: Thanks to recent changes in our understanding of the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the importance of lifestyle modification to prevent the progression of kidney dysfunction and its complications has become clear. In addition, effective collaboration between general practitioners (general practitioners) and nephrologists is essential to provide a better system of care for the treatment of CKD. In this cluster randomized study, we examined the impact of behavior change on the outcome of early to mid-stage CKD. DESIGN: Stratified open cluster randomized trial. SETTING: A total of 489 GPs belonging to 49 local medical societies (clusters) in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,379 patients (1195 in group A (standard intervention) and 1,184 in group B (advanced intervention)) aged 40 to 74 years, with CKD and under consultation with general practitioners. INTERVENTION: All patients were managed according to current CKD guidelines. Group B clusters received three additional interventions: patients were given both an educational intervention for lifestyle change and a CKD status letter that sought to prevent withdrawal from treatment, and group B GPs received datasheets to facilitate reducing the gap between target and practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measures were 1) the rate of non-adherence to patients' acceptance of continued medical follow-up, 2) the rate of collaboration between GPs and nephrologists, and 3) the progression of CKD. RESULTS: The rate of intermittent clinical visits was significantly lower in group B (16.2% in group A and 11.5% in group B, p = 0.01). Significantly higher referral and co-treatment rates were observed in Group B (p<0.01). The mean rate of eGFR deterioration tended to be lower in group B (group A: 2.6+/-5.8 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, group B: 2.4+/- 5.1 ml/ min/1.73 m2/year, p = 0.07). In subjects with stage 3 CKD (group A: 2.4+/-5.9 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, group B: 1.9+/-4.4 ml/min/1.73 m2/year, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our care system significantly reduced behavior change of CKD patients, i.e. discontinuous clinical visits, and resulted in significantly higher referral and co-treatment rates of both GPs and nephrologists, resulting in delayed CKD progression, especially in patients. with proteinuric Stage 3 CKD.

Evidence for outcomes is insufficient. The review expands knowledge in the field by demonstrating the benefits of CDSSs outside of experienced academic centres.",0,1,
609,Impact of computer-assisted implementation of European Best Practice Guidelines on commitment and goal achievement: ORAMA results.,"Background: The success of guidelines largely depends on their effective implementation and adoption in clinical practice. The Optimal Renal Anemia Management Assessment (ORAMA) study investigated the impact of the European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) on patient outcomes. Methods: ORAMA was a prospective, international, multicenter, cluster randomized study. Fifty-three centers in eight European countries enrolled patients with stage V chronic kidney disease receiving chronic dialysis treatment. Patients were either anemic (hemoglobin [Hb] <11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or were treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and/or iron supplementation. Centers were randomized into two groups with or without access to a computerized clinical decision support (CDS) system. In a post hoc analysis, patients were further subdivided into whether or not investigators adhered to EBPG, regardless of CDS use. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with Hb >11 g/dL (110 g/L) reflecting hematological targets in the revised EPBG. Results: In this population of 599 dialysis patients, hematological targets did not differ in the presence or absence of a CDS system. While the width of the distribution curves remained unchanged, there was an overall shift towards improved patient distribution by Hb categories. The proportion of patients with Hb >11 g/dL (110 g/L) was higher among adherents (79% and 84% with or without CDS, respectively) than among those without (59% and 57%, respectively). Conclusions: ORAMA is the first international study to show that adherence to EBPG improves the acquisition of anemia indices. Availability of a CDS system did not affect anemia management.",0,1,
610,The effect of computerized evidence-based guidelines on the management of asthma and angina in adults in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Summary Objective: To evaluate the use of a computerized support system in decision-making for the implementation of evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of asthma and angina in adults in primary care. Design: Before and after a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial using a two-by-two incomplete block design. Setting: 60 general practices in north east England. Participants: GPs and nurse practitioners involved in the study practices, and patients aged 18 years or older with angina or asthma. Key outcome measures: Adherence to guidelines based on review of case notes and patient-reported generic and case-specific outcome measures. Results: The computerized decision support system had no significant impact on consultation rates, the course of care measures (including prescribing), or patient-reported outcomes for both conditions. The usage levels of the software were low. Conclusions: Computed evidence-based guidelines for the management of asthma or angina in adults in primary care had no effect. This was probably due to low usage of the software, even though the system was as optimized as technically possible. While the technical issues of producing a system that fully supports chronic disease management have been resolved, the challenge remains of integrating systems into clinical encounters where intensive practitioners manage patients with complex, multiple conditions.",0,1,

612,The impact of exercise referral plans in primary care on improving physical activity and health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of exercise referral plans on physical activity and health outcomes. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and trial records through October 2009. We also checked the working references. Study selection Design: randomized controlled trials or non-randomized controlled (cluster or individual) studies published in peer review journals. POPULATION sedentary individuals, with or without a medical diagnosis. Exercise referral schemes are defined as: open referrals by primary health care professionals to third-party service providers to increase physical activity or exercise, physical activity, or individualized exercise programs, and initial evaluation and monitoring throughout programs. Comparators: usual care, non-intervention or alternative exercise referral plans. RESULTS Eight randomized controlled trials comparing exercise referral schemes with usual care (six trials), alternative physical activity intervention (two), and an exercise referral scheme plus a self-determination theory intervention (one) met inclusion criteria. Compared with usual care, follow-up data for exercise referral schemes showed an increased number of participants performing at least 90-150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week (added relative risk 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and a reduced level of depression (aggregated standardized risk). mean difference -0.82, -1.28 to -0.35). Evidence for a difference between groups in moderate or vigorous-intensity physical activity or other health outcomes was inconsistent at follow-up. We did not find any difference in outcomes between the exercise referral schemes and the other two comparator groups. None of the included studies reported individual outcomes in individuals with specific medical diagnoses. Significant heterogeneity in the nature and quality of exercise referral plans between studies may have contributed to the inconsistency in the outcome findings. Conclusions Significant uncertainties remain about the effectiveness of exercise referral plans to increase indicators of physical activity, fitness or health, or the efficient use of resources for sedentary people with or without a medical diagnosis.",0,0,

DESIGN: Economic evaluation as well as a randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals) in the Netherlands 2005-9. PARTICIPANTS: 134 adults aged 18-65 years listed for chronic low back pain: 66 were randomized to integrated care and 68 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Integrated care consisted of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics with the participation of a supervisor and a graded activity program based on cognitive behavioral principles. Normal care was provided by general practitioners and occupational physicians according to Dutch guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to return to sustainable work. The secondary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured using EuroQol. RESULTS: Total costs in the integrated care group (£13165, £13600) were significantly lower than in the regular care group (£18475, £13616). Cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves demonstrated that integrated care is cost-effective compared to regular care for return to work and QALYs earned. Cost-benefit analyzes showed that every pound1 invested in integrated care would return an estimated £26. The net societal benefit of integrated care compared to regular care was 5744 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an integrated care program for the listed chronic low back pain patients has great potential to significantly reduce societal costs, increase the effectiveness of care, improve quality of life and improve function on a large scale. Therefore, integrated care has huge gains for both patients and society as well as employers.",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING 60 primary schools in the southwest of England. PARTICIPANTS Primary school children at 4th year (8-9 years) of school at recruitment and baseline assessment, 5th year at intervention, and 5th year at follow-up assessment (9-10 years). INTERVENTION The Active Lifelong Year 5 (AFLY5) intervention consisted of teacher education, tutoring and child-parent interactive homework plans, all required materials for lessons and homework, and school newsletters and written materials for parents. The intervention took place in the children's 5th academic year (9-10 years). Schools allocated to control received standard instruction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Predetermined primary outcomes were accelerometer-assessed minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day, accelerometer-assessed minutes of sedentary behavior per day, and daily fruit and vegetable serving consumption. RESULTS 60 schools with more than 2221 children were recruited"";"" Valid data were available for fruit and vegetable consumption for 2121 children, for accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior for 1252 children, and secondary outcomes for 1825 to 2212 children for the main analyses. None of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools allocated to the AFLY5 intervention and children allocated to the control group. The difference between the averages between the intervention group and the control group was -1.35 (95% confidence interval -5.29 to 2.59) minutes per day for moderate to vigorous physical activity, -0.11 (-9.71 to 9.49) minutes per day for sedentary behavior, and fruit and vegetable consumption. 0.08 (-0.12 to 0.28) servings per day for The intervention was effective for three out of nine of the secondary outcomes after considering multiple tests: time spent watching screens on weekends (-21 (-37 to -4) minutes per day), self-reported servings. daily snacks (-0.22 (-0.38 to -0.05)) and daily high-energy drink servings (-0.26 (-0.43 to -0.10)) were reduced. Results from a series of sensitivity analyzes and per-protocol analyzes testing different assumptions about missing data yielded similar results. CONCLUSION Findings show that the AFLY5 school-based intervention is not effective in increasing physical activity levels, reducing sedentary behaviors, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in primary school children. Change in these activities may require more intense behavioral interventions with children or upstream interventions at the family and community level as well as at the school setting level. These findings have implications for researchers, policy makers, public health practitioners, and physicians involved in health promotion, policy making, and commissioning services.

PARTICIPANTS 2591 non-pregnant smokers aged 16 years or older who called the quit line between February 2009 and February 2010 and agreed to set a quit date: 648 each with standard support, proactive support or nicotine replacement therapy. were randomized to support, and 647 were randomized to standard support with nicotine replacement therapy. INTERVENTIONS In addition to standard support, two interventions were offered: six weeks of nicotine replacement therapy, free and proactive counseling sessions provided (repeated phone calls from cessation counselors and interaction with them). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported smoking cessation six months or more after the quit date. The secondary outcome was cessation confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide measured at six or more months. RESULTS At 6 months, 17.7% (n = 229) of those who received nicotine replacement therapy reported smoking cessation, while 20.1% (n = 261) did not recommend such therapy (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.04) and 18.2%. Compared to 19.6 (n = 254), % (n = 236) of proactive counselors offered standard support (0.91, 0.75 to 1.11). Data confirmed by carbon monoxide readings only changed the findings for nicotine replacement therapy; smoking cessation was confirmed in 6.6% (85/1295) of those who received nicotine replacement therapy, compared with 9.4% (122/1296) for whom no such treatment was recommended (0.67, 0.50 versus 0.90).

621,The impact of patient-specific ratings on angina research decisions versus conventional guidelines: Relevance of Referral and Investigation in the Angina (ARIA) Study,"BACKGROUND: Conventional guidelines have limited effect in changing physicians' testing order. We sought to determine the effect of patient-specific ratings on appropriate angina research versus conventional guidelines. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial in which 145 physicians with patient-specific ratings (online prompt indicating whether certain vignettes were deemed appropriate or inappropriate for research, with access to detailed information on how ratings were derived) and 147 physicians received conventional guidelines from the American Heart Association and Europe Society of Cardiology. Physicians provided recommendations on 12 Web-based patient vignettes prior to these interventions and 12 vignettes thereafter. The result was the proportion of appropriate research decisions defined by the 2 independent expert panels. RESULTS: Exercise electrocardiography decisions were more appropriate with patient-specific ratings (819/1491 [55%]) compared to conventional guidelines (648/1488 [44%]) (odds ratio [OR], 1.57""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36–1.82). The effect was stronger for 1009/1576 [64%] [OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.90] with conventional guidelines compared to patient-specific ratings with angiography (1274/1595 [80%] -2.62]) Intra-arm comparisons confirmed no effect of conventional guidelines, but patient-specific ratings significantly altered physicians' decisions regarding appropriate recommendations for exercise electrocardiography (55% vs. 42%; OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.14–3.22) and angiography. for (65% versus 80%; OR, 2.10; ""95% CI, 1.79-2.47). These effects were robust for vignetting characteristics, including physician specialty (cardiologists and GPs) and old age, female gender, and non-white race/ethnicity.

622,The effect of doctor's advice and patient compliance on colorectal cancer test rates.,"This study investigated (1) patient characteristics associated with physician recommendation and patient adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, and (2) the combined impact of recommendation and compliance on broadly defined CRC testing. Data are from the 1999 MA BRFSS and a callback survey of 869 BRFSS participants aged 50 and over. Logistic regression was used to determine the correlations between recommendation, adherence, and testing. Patient-physician factors were positively associated with advice, adherence, and testing. Inadequate health insurance was negatively associated with recommendation (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.27-0.78%) and testing (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.38--1.1) . Men were not more likely to be recommended (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.78--1.5), but were more likely to comply (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0) and be tested (OR = 1.4, 95%). CI = 1.0–1.9).

DESIGN Multicenter, randomized controlled trial. SETTING 13 emergency services in the north of France. PARTICIPANTS 605 people who deliberately attempted to commit suicide by poisoning themselves were discharged from the emergency room. INTERVENTION The intervention consisted of contacting patients by phone who had attempted suicide one month or three months after discharge from the emergency department to assess the success of the proposed treatment or to adjust the treatment. Control patients were treated as usual and in most cases referred back to their GP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who attempted suicide again, the number of deaths by suicide, and the 13-month follow-up losses. Secondary outcome measures were the types and number of health care contacts. RESULTS On a treatment basis, the three groups did not differ significantly in subsequent suicide attempts, deaths by suicide, or loss of follow-up: contact at one month (23% intervention (23% (34/147) vs controls 30% (93)/312), difference 7%, % 95 confidence interval - 2% to 15%, three months (25% (36/146) v 30%, difference 5%, - 4% to 14%.

The observation tool documented the tools and procedures recommended by the dietary guidelines and adopted in patient charts and in the office setting. The face-to-face structured interview evaluated self-reported nutrition-related activities by physicians and staff, reflecting the recommendations of the dietary guidelines. Data from these two tools were used to generate four compliance scores corresponding to the following areas: office organization, nutritional screening, nutritional advice/referral, and patient follow-up. KEY RESULTS: Adoption of the handbook's recommendations was highest among practices in the training group, as reflected by higher engagement scores. They organized their offices (P = .005) and screened their patients for their eating habits (P = .046) (P = .046), significantly closer to the recommendations of the nutritional guideline compared to practices in the manual group alone. However, despite being the highest in terms of compliance, education group practices only adhered to the guidelines' recommendations on nutrition advice/referral at 54.9%, and 28.5% to recommendations on office organization, 23.5% to nutritional screening recommendations, and 14.6% to Patient follow-up recommendations. . CONCLUSIONS: Basic care practices exposed to the nutritional guideline in a training session adopted more than the recommendations of the guideline. Specifically, practices invited to the training were more likely to conduct nutritional screening and structure their office environments to be conducive to providing nutrition-related services for cancer prevention. The effect of education was moderate and not statistically significant for nutritional advice/referral or patient follow-up, which is important in achieving long-term dietary changes in patients. Low overall scores of commitment to nutrition-related activities indicate that there is much room for improvement among practices in the training group.",0,0,

Methods. Fifty-six internists were randomized to evaluate clinical scenarios without DSA after initial evaluation of scenarios with a written or computerized DSA. Pairwise differences between assisted and unassisted scores were determined for diagnostic accuracy, treatment choice, severity and subtype classification, antipsychotic use, and mental health consultations. Results. Diagnostic accuracy decreased from 64% to 73% with written DSA and from 67% to 64% with computerized scanning (P = 0.0065). Residents using computerized DSA (vs DSA) requested fewer consultations (65% vs. 52%, P = 0.028). In post hoc analysis, written DSA increased sensitivity (66% vs 89%, P < 0.001) and computerized DSA improved specificity (66% vs 86%, P = 0.0020), but decreased sensitivity (67% vs 49%, P = 0.0020). 0.011). Conclusions. A written DSA improved diagnostic accuracy, while a computerized DSA did not. However, computerized DSA improved specificity and reduced mental health consultations.",0,1,

632,Effective weight management practice: a review of lifestyle intervention evidence.,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the existence of guidelines for obesity management, uncertainty remains about which interventions encompass effective implementation. This uncertainty can be a barrier for busy healthcare professionals who do not have the time and expertise to fully evaluate the huge amount of literature published each year on obesity management. Therefore, the aims of this review were to synthesize the available evidence, identify the most effective and promising practices for adult obesity management using an established methodology, and present this information according to its quality. EVIDENCE GATHERING: This synthesis review has been conducted since January 2009. A detailed search of the relevant databases was carried out up to September 2010. The most effective and promising practices were identified through systematic reviews (with/without meta-analysis) using the Canadian Best Practice Initiative Methodology Background Paper. ) as the most rigorous methodology (level 1) to develop recommendations considered to be most effective, and non-systematic reviews (level 2) to develop recommendations considered most promising. The literature was reviewed and classified at these two levels of rigor and supplemented by primary studies to further refine the recommendations. RESULTS: Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses was classified into three intervention themes or context areas where more specific, most effective, and/or promising practice recommendations could be placed. These intervention themes were (1) targeted multicomponent interventions for weight management, (2) dietary manipulation strategies, and (3) delivery of weight management interventions, including the roles of healthcare professionals and delivery method. Each theme was accompanied by specific recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the long-term value of multi-component interventions and strengthens the role of healthcare professionals. The findings will help inform evidence-based practice for health care practitioners involved in obesity management and prevention.",0,0,
633,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention in all populations: a modeling study,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of a population-wide risk factor reduction program aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. DESIGN Economic modeling analysis. SET England and Wales. Population The entire population. The Spreadsheet Model Model to measure reductions in cardiovascular disease over ten years, assuming that the benefits apply consistently to men and women of all ages and risk groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prevented cardiovascular events, quality-adjusted life years gained, and savings in health care costs for a given activity""; estimates of how much it would be worth to achieve a particular outcome. RESULTS A program covering the entire population of England and Wales (approximately 50 million people ) would reduce cardiovascular events by just 1%, saving at least Ã‚Â 30 million (â€š34 million; “$48 million) per year without additional intervention in healthcare. . Reducing the average cholesterol concentrations or blood pressure levels in the population by 5% (as already achieved with similar interventions in some other countries) would save at least £80 million to £100 million annually. Legislation or other measures to reduce dietary salt intake by 3g per day (average daily intake of about 8.5g) would prevent around 30,000 cardiovascular events with a savings of at least £40m per year. Legislation that would reduce industrial trans fatty acid intake by around 0.5% of total energy content could save around 570,000 life years and save NHS worth at least £230m per year. CONCLUSIONS Any intervention that achieves a modest population-wide reduction in any major cardiovascular risk factor will not only improve health but also result in clear cost savings for the NHS. Given the conservative assumptions used in this model, the real benefits will likely be greater.",0,0,
634,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an exposure-based return-to-work program for patients on sick leave for common mental disorders: design of a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: To reduce sick leave time and loss of productivity due to common mental disorders (CMDs), we have developed a return-to-work program to be provided by occupational physicians (OPs) based on in vivo (RTW) exposure principles. -E program). This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this program by comparing it with the usual care (CAU). The three research questions we have are: 1) Is an RTW-E program more effective at reducing sick leave for employees with common mental illnesses than usual care? 2) Is an RTW-E program more effective in reducing sick leave for employees with anxiety disorders than for employees with other common mental disorders? 3) From a societal perspective, is an RTW-E program cost-effective compared to usual care? METHODS/DESIGN: This study was designed as a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial with one-year follow-up and randomization at the OPs level. We targeted 60 OPs to include 200 patients. Patients in the intervention group received the RTW-E program. Patients in the control group received care as usual. Eligible patients were on sick leave for at least two weeks and no longer than eight weeks due to pervasive mental disorders. As primary outcome measures, we calculated the time to full return to work and the duration of sick leave. Secondary outcome measures were time to partial return to work, prevalence of sick leave at 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-ups, and scores for distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and fatigue symptoms""; perceived work conditions; self-efficacy for return to work; coping behavior; avoidance behavior; patient satisfaction;"" and business adaptations. As process criteria, we used intervention compliance indices in the intervention group and employee-manager communication in both groups. Economic costs were calculated from a societal perspective. Total costs consisted of healthcare consuming costs, sick leave and lost production costs due to reduced productivity, and out-of-pocket costs for patients to travel to their OP. DISCUSSION: Results will be published in 2009. The strengths and weaknesses of the study protocol are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN72643128.",0,0,

The Diabetes Intervention study in the Canary Islands (INDICA study) aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of educational interventions supported by new technology decision tools for type 2 diabetes patients and primary care workers in the Canary Islands. Methods/design The INDICA trial is an open, population-based, multicenter, clinical-controlled trial randomized by clusters to one of three interventions or usual care. The setting is primary care where doctors and nurses are invited to participate. Patients diagnosed with diabetes, 18Â¨C65 years old and using mobile phones regularly were randomly selected. Patients with serious comorbidities were excluded from the study. Clusters are primary health care practices that have adequate professionals and appropriate locations to provide the response. The calculated sample size was 2,300 patients. Patients in Group 1 receive an eight-session training group program every 3 months, led by trained nurses and monitored via diaries, a web-based platform, and dedicated semi-automatic SMS for ongoing support. Primary care workers in Group 2 receive a short training program that includes a decision support tool embedded in electronic clinical records and a monthly patient feedback report to update their diabetes information. Group 3 receives a combination of interventions for patients and professionals. The primary endpoint is change in HbA1c within 2 years. Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular and microvascular diabetes complications, quality of life, psychological outcomes, diabetes knowledge, and healthcare use. Data are collected from interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations and records. Generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements will be used to analyze changes in results.

637,Efficacy of a behavioral intervention to prevent excessive weight gain in infancy (The Baby Milk Trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Infancy is a period of rapid growth and habit formation and can therefore be a critical period for obesity prevention. Excess weight gain in infancy is associated with later obesity, and formula-fed infants are more likely to gain excess weight compared to breast-fed infants. The primary trial outcome is a change in weight standard deviation score from birth to 1 year. METHODS/DESIGN: We will enroll 650 to 700 formula-fed parents in a single (evaluator) blind, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial within 14 weeks of the birth of their infant. The focus of the intervention is the caregiver (usually the mother) and the primary outcome is the infant. The intervention group will receive behavioral intervention aimed at reducing formula milk intake, promoting responsive feeding and healthy weaning, and preventing excessive weight gain in infancy. The intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory and action planning ('implementation intentions'). It consists of three components: (1) a motivational component to strengthen parents' motivation to follow Baby Milk feeding guidelines, (2) an action planning component to help turn motivation into action, and (3) a coping planning component to assist parents in dealing with difficult situations. . It will be delivered by trained facilitators (research nurses) for 6 months in three face-to-face, two telephone and written materials. The control group will have the same number of contacts as the facilitators and general nutritional issues will be discussed. Anthropometric results will be measured at baseline, 6 months and 12 months following standard operating procedures by trained research personnel blinded to group allocation. Validated questionnaires will assess milk intake, temperament, appetite, sleep, maternal quality of life, and maternal psychological factors. A 4-day food diary will be completed in 8 months. DISCUSSION: The results of the research will help inform infant feeding guidelines and understand the links between infant feeding, behavior, appetite and growth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRTCN20814693 .

638,Efficacy of a combined strategy to improve therapeutic adherence and degree of control in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND: Cholesterol values remain above guideline levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. One of the factors limiting the achievement of goals in such patients is therapeutic non-compliance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to improve control of hypercholesterolemic patients, consisting of a combined strategy that included the delivery of printed information, compliance-to-treat check cards, and the sending of text messages as complementary measures. support of intervention in the GP practice. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized parallel group clinical trial will be conducted in family medicine outpatient facilities of eight health centers in three Autonomous Regions of Spain (Comunidades Autonomas), involving a total of 358 subjects aged 18 years and over. hypercholesterolemia. Printed material informing patients in the intervention group about the disease and its management, cell phone text messages with guide summaries, reminders of upcoming appointments and/or self-report cards to check compliance with new appointment arrangements and recommendations in case of absence. Both groups - intervention and control - will receive routine recommendations from their physicians in accordance with current European clinical practice guidelines for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk management. Regarding the measurements to be made, the main variable is the proportion of subjects achieving the target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels over a 24-month follow-up period. Secondary variables are: adherence to lifestyle recommendations and adherence to medication""; change in lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk levels; outlook for cardiovascular events; physical activity; food consumption; smoking habit; anthropometric measures; blood pressure; health problems; use of hypolipidemic agents; sociological -demographic data; beliefs and expectations regarding preventive recommendations; and degree of satisfaction with the combined strategy.

639,The effectiveness of a potential physician self-monitoring transfusion monitoring system.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to search for a more effective transfusion monitoring system than the existing retrospective peer review system. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used a study-control, pre-intervention, and post-intervention design to evaluate the effectiveness of a functioning physician trainee self-supervision transfusion monitoring system without the direct involvement of transfusion service physicians. This research also evaluated the effectiveness of giving doctors a note with transfusion guidelines. Three process indicators were used to assess physician behavior at various stages of the blood ordering process: 1) the number of crossmatches ordered per referral, 2) the transfusion-to-crossmatch rate, and 3) the number of blood units returned to the patient. laboratory after physician self-examination. The study used two outcome indicators to reflect overall blood usage: 1) the percentage of patients transfused with red blood cells and 2) the number of blood units transfused per recipient per month. CONCLUSIONS: Physician-candidate self-regulation system implemented in the research hospital did not reverse physician transfusion decisions, and a grading process with transfusion guidelines to physicians in the control hospital did not reduce blood use. However, a temporary reduction in blood use was observed in the study hospital. CONCLUSION: The decline was hypothesized to be due to a Hawthorne effect, in which the observed behavior was influenced by the subject's awareness of the research study.",0,1,

METHODS: A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases of all English-language articles was conducted between January 1983 and July 2010. We manually searched bibliographies of articles from the electronic search to identify additional studies. Inclusion criteria were: full-length articles describing the original trial""; randomized controlled trial (RCT) or observational study design with a control group; AD studies for ADs, AD as an independent intervention; drug prescription as target behavior. Data extraction independently by two reviewers The outcomes evaluated were: the difference in relative change in prescription rate between the intervention and control groups; the difference in absolute change in prescription rate between the intervention and control groups; and the effect size calculated as the standardized mean difference RESULTS: Including 11 RCTs and 4 observational studies Five RCTS reported results demonstrating efficacy, while 2 RCTs reported a positive effect on some of the target drugs. Two observational studies found AS effective and 2 not. The median difference in relative change between studies reviewed was for RCTs 21% (43.75% interquartile range) and observational work 9% for malaria (8.5% interquartile range). Among the studies reviewed, the median effect size was -0.09 (interquartile range 2.73). CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows that AD can be effective in optimizing drug prescription by APs. Although variable, the magnitude of the effect was moderate in most studies. This systematic review also provides evidence supporting the use of AD as a strategy to promote evidence-based prescribing of drugs or incorporation of clinical guidelines into clinical practice.

641,The effectiveness of voice reminder in hand hygiene compliance,"Multimodal interventions aim to improve HCWs' adherence to hand hygiene guidelines. Visitors are not primarily targeted, but can spread epidemic infections. Effective interventions that increase visitor adherence to hand hygiene guidelines are needed to prevent the transmission of epidemic infections to and from healthcare settings. Methods An audible hand hygiene reminder triggered by an electronic motion sensor was placed at the hospital ward entrances. An 8-month pre-intervention and post-intervention study was conducted to measure the compliance of hospital visitors and staff with hand hygiene guidelines. Results Overall hand hygiene compliance increased from 7.6% to 49.9% (P < .001). Engagement of visitors and non-clinical staff immediately increased from 10.6% to 63.7% and from 5.3% to 34.8%, respectively (P < .001).

Electronic order sets have shown promise as a way to integrate guidance information with electronic order entry systems and facilitate safer, more effective maintenance. Purpose The aim was to examine the efficacy of a computer-based antibacterial ordering in increasing the proportion of patients discontinued from antibacterial wound prophylaxis within the appropriate time frame. Design The authors performed a quasi-experimental discontinuous time series analysis over an 8-month study period with the implementation of a computer-based ordering system designed to prevent overtime of surgical prophylaxis antibacterials. Measurement The primary outcome was the proportion of surgeries using antibacterials that were discontinued in the appropriate time frame. In addition, we evaluated the percentage of surgeries with documentation of infection after application of the electronic intervention among surgeries where the prescriber indicated that the cause of antibacterial therapy was therapy. Results Computer-based order intervention significantly improved the rate of surgeries from 38.8% to 55.7% (p<0.001) with timely discontinuation of antibacterials in the intervention hospital, while the control hospital remained at 56-57% (p=0.006) treatment difference between controlled and controlled hospitals).

644,Efficacy of an Intervention to Improve Occupational Physicians' Guidelines on Duration of Illness Absence in Workers with Pervasive Mental Disorder: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial,"Purpose Evidence-based guidelines in occupational health care improve the quality of care and can reduce sick leave time. However, compliance by occupational physicians (OPs) with the guideline is limited. Based on the literature on guideline implementation, an intervention was developed that has been shown to effectively improve self-reported compliance in OPs. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this intervention leads to earlier return to work (RTW) in workers with generalized mental disorder (CMD). Methods In a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial, 66 OPs were randomized. The study included 3379 workers, of whom 1493 were in the intervention group and 1886 in the control group. Outcomes were: time to full RTW, time to first RTW, and total disease-free hours. Cox regression analyzes and generalized linear mixed model analyzes were used for evaluations. Results Among the 3228 workers with CMD, the median time to RTW was 154 days. There was no significant difference in full RTW (time) between the intervention and control group HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.81-1.15) or the initial RTW HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.80-1.15). The mean total disease-free hours were 478 hours in the intervention group and 483 hours in the control group. Results Intervention to increase OPs adherence to guidelines did not lead to earlier RTW in workers with CMDs who were guided by OPs. Possible explanations are remaining external barriers to guide use, and this perceived guideline compliance may not represent actual guideline compliance and improved maintenance.

646,Efficacy of Cholinesterase Inhibitors and Memantine in the Treatment of Dementia: Evidence Review for a Clinical Practice Guideline,"Background: 5 US Food and Drug AdministrationÂ¨The effectiveness of approved pharmacological treatments for dementias in providing clinically meaningful improvements is unclear. Purpose: To review the evidence for the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and the neuropeptide-modifying agent memantine, particularly in providing clinically significant improvements in cognitive, general function, behavior, and quality of life. patients with dementia. Data Sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, AgeLine, and PsycINFO from January 1986 to November 2006. Study Selection: Randomized, controlled studies in English were included in the review. have evaluated pharmacological agents for adults with a diagnosis of dementia, have not used a crossover design, and have a quality score of at least 3 on the Jadad scale. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on study characteristics and outcomes, including adverse events. Effect sizes were calculated and data were combined when appropriate. Data Synthesis: 96 publications representing 59 unique studies were eligible for this review. Both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine had consistent effects in cognition and overall assessment, but summary estimates showed small effect sizes. Outcomes in the behavioral and quality of life domains were evaluated less frequently and showed less consistent effects. Most studies were of short duration (6 months), which limited their ability to detect a delay in the onset or progression of dementia. Three studies directly compared different cholinesterase inhibitors and found no differences in cognition and behavior. Limitations: Limitations of current studies include only inclusion of patients with short-term, mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, poor reporting of adverse events, lack of clear definitions for statistical significance, limited evaluation of behavior and quality of life outcomes, and limited direct comparison of different treatments. Conclusions: Treatment of dementia with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may result in statistically significant but clinically marginal improvement in cognition measures and overall assessment of dementia.",0,0,
647,The effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease in primary care: a randomized controlled trial.,"CONTEXT: Most older adults with dementia will be cared for by primary care physicians, but the primary care practice setting presents significant challenges for providing quality care. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a collaborative care model to improve the quality of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT, AND PATIENTS: Controlled clinical trial in 153 older adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers who were randomized by physician to receive joint care management (n = 84) or enhanced usual care (n = 69) in primary care settings within 2 January 2002 U.S. university affiliated healthcare systems until August 2004. Eligible patients (identified through screening or medical record) met diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and had a self-identified caregiver. INTERVENTION: Intervention patients received 1 year of care management by an interdisciplinary team led by an advanced practice nurse who worked with the patient's family caregiver and integrated with primary care. The team used standard protocols to initiate treatment and identify, monitor and treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, emphasizing non-drug management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months. Secondary outcomes included the Cornell Scale of Depression in Dementia (CSDD), cognition, activities of daily living, resource use, and the caregiver's severity of depression. RESULTS: 89% of intervention patients initiated by caregiver reports triggered at least 1 protocol for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, with a mean of 4 per patient out of a total of 8 possible protocols. Intervention patients were more likely to take cholinesterase inhibitors (79.8% vs 55.1%; P = .002) and antidepressants (45.2% vs 27.5%; P = .03). Significantly less behavioral and Intervention caregivers reported significant improvements in distress as measured by caregiver based on overall NPI score at 12 months (mean difference, -5.6; P = .01) and 18 months (mean difference, -5.4; P = .01). NPI at 12 months;"" At 18 months, caregivers showed improvement in depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. No group differences were found in CSDD, cognition, activities of daily living, or rates of hospitalization, nursing home placement, or mortality. RESULTS: Collaborative care for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of care and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia among primary care patients and their caregivers.

651,The effectiveness of guided care given by occupational physicians on the return to work of workers with generalized mental disorders: a cluster-randomized controlled research design.,"BACKGROUND: Illness absenteeism due to common mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder) is a problem in many Western countries. Long-term sickness absence entails significant societal and financial costs. For workers with pervasive mental disorders, sickness absence costs are much higher than medical costs. In the Netherlands, a practice guide has been developed that supports an enabling approach of the occupational physician to ensure faster return to work by increasing the problem-solving capacity of employees, particularly in relation to work environments. Studies on this guideline show that there is a promising relationship between adherence to the guideline and shortening of sick leave, but at the same time, occupational physicians adhere to the guideline at a minimal level. Therefore, this study evaluates the impact of guide-based care on the full return to work of workers who are listed ill due to common mental disorders. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial with occupational physician-level randomization. For one year, occupational physicians in the intervention group receive innovative training to improve their guidance-based care, while occupational physicians in the control group provide care as usual. A total of 232 workers, who were listed for common mental disorders and were counseled by the participating workplace physicians, will be included in the study. Data are collected through the occupational health service registry system and through questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary result is time to full return to work. Secondary outcomes were partial return to work, total sick leave days, symptoms, and workability. Personal and job characteristics are prognostic measures. Additional measures include coping, self-efficacy, relapse, personal experiences, satisfaction with occupational physician consultations and supervisor contact, supervisor's experiences and behaviors, and extent of guideline compliance. DISCUSSION: If the results show that guided care actually leads to a faster and more sustainable return to work, this study will contribute to lower personal, societal and financial costs.

652,Efficacy of medical nutrition therapy provided by dietitians in the management of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Objective To evaluate the impact of dietitian-provided medical nutrition therapy (MNT) on medical and clinical outcomes for adults with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and compare MNT administered according to practice guidelines nutritional care (PGC) versus basic nutritional care (BC) administered to MNT. Design A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial of two levels of MNT on metabolic control in people newly diagnosed with or currently receiving NIDDM was conducted at diabetes centers in three states (Minnesota, Florida, and Colorado). BC consisted of a single visit with a dietitian""; PGC included an initial visit with a dietitian followed by two visits during the first 6 weeks of the study period. Data were collected at study entry and at 3 and 6 months. Subjects Results 179 men aged 38 to 76 years and reported for female: 85 randomly assigned to BC and 94 to PGC This represents 72% of 247 enrolled subjects Defined as a nonrandom comparison group Outcomes Fasting plasma glucose among medical outcome measures (ABG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and serum lipid levels included clinical outcomes Weight, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and medical changes Treatment Statistical analyzes Initial analysis of discrete variables was performed using Yates-corrected ?2 statistic Initial analysis of continuous variables were performed by analysis of variance, analyzed by paired t-test, and comparisons between groups were made using test for independent groups. was analyzed. Results at 6 months resulted in significant improvements in blood glucose control as indicated by PGC, FPG and HbA1c levels and BC resulted in significant improvements in HbA1c level. Participants assigned to the PGC group had an average FPG level of 10.5% lower than baseline at 6 months, and those in the BC group had a 5.3% lower value. Among subjects with diabetes for more than 6 months, those who received PGC had significantly better HbA1c at 3 months compared to those who received BC. The comparison group showed no improvement in glycemic control over the comparable 6 months. PGC subjects had significant improvements in cholesterol values at 6 months, and subjects in both the PGC and BC groups had significant weight loss. Results MNT provided by dietitians resulted in significant improvements in medical and clinical outcomes in both the BC and PGC groups and is beneficial for people with NIDDM. People with diabetes duration longer than 6 months tended to do better with PGC than with BC. Due to the increasing trend in glucose levels after 3 months, continued MNT by dietitians is important for long-term metabolic control. J Am Diet Assoc. 1995;"" 95:1009-1017.",0,1,
653,Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in improving lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia supported by general practitioners: The Dislip-EM study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The non-pharmacological approach to cholesterol control in patients with hyperlipidemia is based on the support of a healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, it is essential to identify the most effective approach to helping patients change their habits. Many efforts have been made to explain changes in or adherence to certain health behaviors. Such efforts have resulted in the development of theories that have been applied in prevention campaigns and include brief advice and counselling. In this context, Motivational Interviewing has proven effective in changing health behaviors in certain situations. However, more robust evidence is needed on the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing in the treatment of chronic pathologies such as dyslipidemia in patients supported by general practitioners. This article describes a protocol to evaluate the efficacy of MI compared to general practice to improve lipid level control in patients with dyslipidemia, assisted by a general practitioner (short recommendation). METHODS/DESIGN: An open, two-arm parallel, multicenter, cluster, controlled, randomized, clinical trial will be conducted. A total of 48-50 general practitioners from 35 public primary care centers in Spain will be randomly selected and recruited to 436 patients with dyslipidemia. They will perform an intervention based on the Motivational Interview or the usual brief advice. Follow-up will be done at 2, 4, 8 and 12 months after the initial assessment. Primary outcomes are lipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and cardiovascular risk. The study will evaluate the degree of diet and physical activity improvement, weight loss in overweight patients, and adherence to treatment guidelines. DISCUSSION: Motivational interviewing skills constitute the primary strategies that GPs use to treat their patients. Having techniques that are affordable, simple, effective and feasible is essential for primary care professionals to help their patients change their lifestyles and improve their health. This study will provide scientific evidence about the effectiveness of Motivational interviewing and will be conducted under strict control over the data collected, ensuring that therapeutic integrity is maintained.

654,The effectiveness of motivational interviewing in patients with dyslipidemia: a randomized cluster trial.,"OBJECTIVE: It is known that it is difficult for people to change their habits. It is crucial to identify the most effective approach that general practitioners (GPs) should use to help their patients change their unhealthy habits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a Motivational Interview-based multifactor intervention performed by GPs to increase lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia compared to standard care. METHODS: A multicenter, controlled, randomized, cluster, two parallel-arm trial with 12-month follow-up conducted in 25 community health centers in Spain. 38 general practitioners and 227 primary care patients with uncontrolled dyslipidemia were included in the study. GPs conducted an intervention based on Motivational Interviewing (MI) or standard practice. Lipid levels were measured and the degree of control analyzed according to the criteria of clinical guidelines. RESULTS: 107 of them were assigned to the Experimental Group (EG) and 120 of them to the Control Group (KG). There was an overall improvement in total cholesterol levels (Mean Difference -MD- = -19.60""; 95% CI: -15.33 at -23.87 mg/dl; p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol levels (MD = -13.78; 95%) CI: -9.77 at -17.79 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and triglycerides (MD = -19.14; CI 95 %: -11.29 at -26.99 mg/dl; p < 0.001) There was no difference between the two groups. however, when we evaluated the degree of lipid control by combining the parameters cholesterol <200 mg/dl and LDL-cholesterol <130 mg/dl, a higher percentage of patients achieved target values in EG compared to CG (13.1% vs. 13.1%). 5.0%; adjusted OR = 5.77, 95% CI: 1.67-19.91 CONCLUSION: A Motivational Interview-based approach by Primary Care physicians targeting patients with dyslipidemia resulted in a significant reduction in all lipid parameters, cardiovascular risk, weight reduction, and reduction of adherence to a Mediterranean diet. compliance, similar to that obtained with the usual intervention and superior combined lipid control in pa ratio achieve their goals and level of physical exercise.

655,The effectiveness of multicomponent interventions in primary health care to promote sustained smoking cessation in adults: a systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to evaluate multicomponent/complex primary care (PC) interventions for their effectiveness in sustained smoking cessation by adult smokers. Design: A systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials was conducted. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: Selected studies met the following criteria: effects of a multicomponent/complex intervention (with 2 or more intervention components) in achieving at least 6 months abstinence in adult smokers visiting a PC, biochemical confirmation of abstinence, therapeutic intent analysis and results are published in English/Spanish. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA statement to report review. We searched the following data sources: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus (from inception to February 2014), 3 major journals, and a tobacco research bulletin. Scottish Interuniversity Guidelines Network checklists were used to assess methodological quality. Data selection, evaluation, and extraction were performed independently using a paired review approach. Due to the heterogeneity of interventions in the included studies, a meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: Nine studies were selected from 1147 references identified (10,204 participants, follow-up up to 48 months, acceptable methodological quality). The methodologies used were mostly individual or group sessions, phone calls, brochures or smoking cessation kits, medicines and economic incentives for doctors, and free medicines for smokers. Complex interventions yielded long-term sustained abstinence ranging from 7% to 40%. Behavioral interventions were effective and had a dose-response effect. Both nicotine replacement and bupropion therapy were safe and effective with no differences observed. CONCLUSIONS: Multicomponent/complex interventions in PC are effective and safe, appearing to provide longer-term sustained smoking cessation success than usual care and counseling alone. The selected studies were heterogeneous and some suffered significant losses in follow-up. Our results suggest that smoking interventions should include multiple components and vigorous patient monitoring is required to maximize outcomes.",0,0,
656,The effectiveness of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders,"BACKGROUND: Nurses often provide care to people with personality disorders on a daily basis. As a result, it is important to determine how effective nursing interventions are in terms of both general management and more specific therapeutic approaches in patients with personality disorders. These are also current political and professional topics of discussion. However, the crucial question for planners, providers, and service brokers is: What research evidence is there about effectiveness? There is also a need to determine that more research is needed to evaluate programs for managing or changing behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to report a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders, whether administered by nurses or with other health professionals. METHOD: The review was conducted according to the UK National Health Service Center Review and Dissemination guidelines. Literature was identified from electronic database searches, footnote tracking, manual search of journals, and contact with authors of studies. A narrative synthesis was made regarding the study design, the participants, and the type of intervention. RESULTS: Eighteen separate studies were included in the review: four randomized controlled trials, four non-randomized controlled trials, seven before and after studies, and three case studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a weak evidence base as to what constitutes effective nursing intervention in persons with personality disorders. The evidence from intervention studies in mixed disciplines is stronger than from nursing intervention studies alone. Intervention studies based on psychological approaches show greater improvements in outcomes than nursing management studies.",0,0,
657,Efficacy of pharmacist care in patients with reactive respiratory disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context It is unknown whether patient outcomes are enhanced by effective pharmacist-patient interactions. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care program for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Design, Environment, and Participants Randomized controlled trial conducted in 36 community pharmacies in Indianapolis, India. From July 1998 to December 1999, we enrolled 1113 participants with active COPD or asthma. Outcomes were evaluated in 947 (85.1%) participants at 6 months and 898. (80.7%) at 12 months. Interventions Pharmaceutical care program (n = 447) provides pharmacists with the latest patient-specific clinical data (peak expiratory flow rates [PEFRs], emergency room [ED] visits, hospitalizations, and medication adherence), education, customized patient education materials, and implementation of the Program. resources to facilitate. The PEFR monitoring control group (n = 363) received a peak flowmeter, instructions on its use, and monthly calls to elicit PEFRs. However, PEFR data were not provided to the pharmacist. Patients in the usual care group (n = 303) were neither given peak flowmeters nor instructed on their use""; PEFR rates were not revealed during monthly phone calls. Pharmacists in both control groups received a training session but received no component of the pharmaceutical care intervention Main Outcome Precautions Peak expiratory flow rates, respiratory emergency room or hospital visits, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), medication adherence, and patient satisfaction Outcomes At 12 months, patients who received pharmaceutical care had significantly higher peak flow rates than the usual care group (P = .02), but not from PEFR monitoring controls (P = .28). (odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.76-2.63; ""P<.001). Patients receiving pharmaceutical care were more satisfied with their pharmacists than the usual care group (P = .03) and the PEFR monitoring group (P = .001), and were more satisfied with health care than the normal care group at only 6 months (P = .01). Despite ample opportunities to implement the program, pharmacists only accessed patient-specific data about half the time and documented actions about half the time records were accessed. Results This pharmaceutical maintenance program increased patients' PEFRs compared to usual care, but provided little benefit compared with peak flow monitoring alone. Pharmaceutical care has increased patient satisfaction but has also increased the amount of respiratory medical care sought.",0,1,
658,The effectiveness of physical therapy in patients with neck pain: an individualized approach using a clinical decision-making algorithm.,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an individualized physical therapy intervention in the treatment of neck pain based on a clinical reasoning algorithm. The efficacy of treatment was examined by assessing changes in deterioration, physical performance, and disability in response to intervention. Design: A treatment group of 30 patients with neck pain completed physical therapy therapy. The eligibility control group was formed by a cohort of 27 individuals with neck pain who did not receive treatment for various reasons. There was no significant difference between groups in demographic data and initial test scores of outcome measures. A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent, pretest-posttest control group design was used. A physical therapist administered an eclectic intervention to the treatment group based on a clinical decision-making algorithm. Treatment outcome measures included the following five dependent variables: cervical range of motion, numerical pain rating, timed-weighted overhead endurance, supine capital flexion endurance test, and Patient-Specific Functional Scale. Both the treatment and control groups completed baseline and follow-up examinations with an average of 4 weeks between tests. Results: Five mixed analyzes of variance with follow-up tests showed a significant difference for all outcome measures in the treatment group compared with the control group. After an average of 4 weeks of physical therapy intervention, patients in the treatment group showed statistically significant increases in cervical range of motion, reductions in pain, increases in measures of physical performance, and decreases in disability level. The control group showed no difference in all five outcome variables between baseline and follow-up test scores. Conclusions: This study described algorithmic-based clinical reasoning strategies to evaluate and treat patients with cervical pain. The algorithm can help clinicians classify patients with cervical pain according to clinical models and provides model-specific guidelines for physical therapy interventions. An organized and specific physical therapy program was effective in improving the condition of patients with neck pain.",0,1,
659,Efficacy of physiotherapy exercise after knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy exercise after elective primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis.

Hand searches: Journal of Physiotherapy, Physical Therapy, Bone and Joint Surgery (British) Conference Proceedings. Methods of review Randomized controlled trials were reviewed if they included a physiotherapy exercise intervention compared to normal or standard physiotherapy care, or if they compared two types of exercise physiotherapy interventions that met review criteria after hospital discharge after elective primary total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. RESULT MEASURES Functional activities of daily living, walking, quality of life, muscle strength and range of motion in the knee joint. Trial quality was evaluated extensively. Narrative synthesis plus meta-analyses with fixed effects models, weighted mean differences, standardized effect sizes and heterogeneity tests. RESULTS Six studies were identified, five of which were eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses. Three to four months after surgery, there was a small to medium standardized effect size (0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.58) in favor of functional exercise for function. Three to four months post-surgery, there were small to moderately weighted mean differences of 2.9 (0.61 to 5.2) for joint range of motion and 1.66 (-1 to 4.3) for quality of life. The benefits of treatment were not apparent at a leap year. CONCLUSIONS Post-discharge interventions that include physiotherapy and functional exercises provide short-term benefit after elective primary total knee arthroplasty.

660,The effectiveness of provider incentives for anemia reduction in rural China: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVES To test the effect of provider performance fee for reducing anemia in rural China. DESIGN A randomized cluster trial of information, subsidies, and incentives for school principals to reduce anemia among their students. Enumerators and study participants were not informed of the task force assignment. SETTINGS 72 randomly selected rural primary schools in northwest China. PARTICIPANTS 3553 fourth and fifth grade students aged 9-11. All fourth and fifth grade students in the sample schools participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS Sample schools were randomly assigned to a control group or one of three treatment arms without any intervention: (a) an information arm from which principals receive information about anemia; (b) a subsidy arm from which principals receive information, and unconditional subsidies; and (c) an incentive arm where principals receive information, subsidies and financial incentives to reduce anemia among students. Twenty-seven schools were assigned to the control arm (1816 students at baseline, 1623 at endpoint), 15 knowledge arms (659 students at baseline, 596 at endpoint), 15 (726 students at baseline) subsidy. , 667 at endpoint) and 15 incentive arms (743 students at baseline, 667 students at endpoint). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Student hemoglobin concentrations. RESULTS The average student hemoglobin concentration was 1.5 g/L (95% CI -1.1 to 4.1) in knowledge schools, 0.8 g/L (-1.8 to 3.3) in subsidized schools, and increased by 2.4 g/L (0 to 4.9) in encouragement compared to the control group of schools. This increase in hemoglobin corresponded to a 24% reduction in the prevalence of anemia (Hb <115 g/L) in foster schools. Interactions with pre-existing incentives for principals to achieve good academic performance led to significantly greater gains in the knowledge and incentive arms: when combined with incentives for good academic performance, the associated effects on student hemoglobin concentration were 9.8 g/L (4.1 to 15.5). greater in knowledge schools and 8.6 g/L (2.1 to 15.1) greater in incentive schools. RESULTS Financial incentives for health promotion were moderately effective. Understanding interactions with other motives and pre-existing incentives is crucial.

661,Efficacy of screening and brief alcohol intervention in primary care (SIPS trial): pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of different brief intervention strategies in reducing hazardous or harmful smoking in primary care. The hypothesis was that more intense intervention would lead to a greater reduction in hazardous or harmful drinking. DESIGN Pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial. LOCATION Primary care practices in the north east and south east of England and in London. PARTICIPANTS Of the 3562 patients aged 18 years and older who routinely present to primary care, 2991 (84.0%) were eligible to enter the study: 900 (30.1%) were screened positive for hazardous or noxious drinking, and 756 (84.0%) received a brief intervention. The sample was predominantly male (62%) and white (92%), and 34% were current smokers. INTERVENTIONS Treatments were randomized to three interventions, each based on the previous one: a patient information leaflet control group, five minutes of structured brief advice, and 20 minutes of brief lifestyle counselling. Delivery of the patient brochure and brief advice took place immediately after screening and brief lifestyle counseling at a subsequent consultation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was patient self-reported hazardous or harmful drinking status, as measured by the six-month alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDITING). A negative AUDIT result (score < 8) indicated nonhazardous or nonharmful drinking. Secondary outcomes were a negative AUDIT result at 12 months, experience of alcohol-related problems (alcohol problems questionnaire), healthcare (EQ-5D), service use, and patients' motivation to change their drinking behavior (readiness for change). modified preparation chart. RESULTS Patient follow-up rates were 83% (n=644) at 6 months and 79% (n=617) at 12 months. At both time points, an intent to treat analysis found no significant difference in CONDITION negative status between the three interventions. Compared to the patient information leaflet group, the odds ratio of having a negative AUDIT result for brief advice is 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.39) and 0.78 (0.48 to 1.25) for brief lifestyle counselling. was. One per-protocol analysis confirmed these findings. RESULTS All patients received simple feedback on the scan results.

662,Efficacy of depression screening and treatment in outpatients,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of depression screening and treatment in poor outpatients admitted to resident physicians. Design: Two-group randomized study (N = 33 interventions, N = 28 usual care) with baseline, 6-month, and 12-month outcome measures. SETTING: Internal Medicine Specialization Clinic. PATIENTS: Clinical patients over 18 years of age who were positive for depression on the PRIME-MD during their visit to their resident doctor. Patients do not seek treatment or care for any emotional problems. All patients were either enrolled in Medicaid or had an income below the poverty line. INTERVENTION: Resident physicians are trained to follow AHCPR (AHRQ""; ""Agency for Health Research and Quality) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in the primary care setting. For intervention group patients, a screening nurse advised residents about positive screen, outlined a standard protocol for them, and attempted to organize behavioral care. Before meeting with the resident, the patients in the usual care group were provided with the scan results by the screening nurse and advised to seek care for their symptoms. MAIN RESULTS: Results for the primary outcome of depression symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) showed that the intervention was successful in reducing symptoms relative to normal care (difference = -4.9 BDI score, P =.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.8 to -0.005 effect size = -0.41). During the 12-month follow-up, 70% of intervention patients were treated for depression (91% of them with antidepressants), while 15% of usual care patients were treated with antidepressants for depression. Depression was noted in another 18% of the usual care group, but no treatment was identified. BDI differences between the intervention and control groups were similar at the 6- and 12-month measurements. Quality of life and costs were also measured, but differences between groups in this regard were not significant. CONCLUSION: Depression screening and treatment by resident doctors has been successful in reducing symptoms compared to usual care in a poor population. Nearly twice as many intervention patients as usual-care controls showed a significant reduction in depression-related symptoms (10 BDI points).",0,0,
663,"Effectiveness of strategies to disseminate and implement clinical guidelines for the management of impacted and unerupted third molars in primary dental care, a set of randomized controlled trials","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different guideline implementation strategies using the Scottish Inter-University Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 42 ""Management of unearthed and impacted third molars"" (published 2000). DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster RCT (2x2 factorial design). SUBJECTS: Sixty-three dental practices across Scotland. The clinical records of all patients aged 16-24 years during the two, four month periods in 1999 (pre-intervention) and 2000 (post-intervention) were searched by a clinical investigator blinded to the intervention group. Data were also collected on the costs of interventions. INTERVENTIONS: 1. The group received a copy of the SIGN 42 Manual and had the opportunity to attend a postgraduate training course (PGEC). In addition, group 2 received supervision and feedback (A and F). Group 3 received a computer assisted learning (CAL) package. Group 4 received A and F and CALs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients whose treatment complied with the guideline. RESULTS: A and F versus A versus F versus weighted t-test (P=0.62) and CAL versus CAL (P=0.76) were not statistically significant. Considering the efficiency results (no difference), the cost effectiveness calculation became a cost minimization calculation. The minimal cost intervention in the trial consisted of providing general dentists (GDPs) with guidelines and the option to attend PGEC courses. Routine data later made available showed a Scotland-wide decline prior to data collection. CONCLUSION: In an environment of unexpectedly high pre-intervention compliance, neither CAL nor A and F increased dentists' adherence to the SIGN guideline compared to mailing the guideline and the opportunity to attend a graduate course. The cost of the CAL arm of the trial was higher than the A and F arm. More work is needed to understand the behavior of dental professionals in response to guideline implementation strategies.",0,1,

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. ADJUST Home intervention in heart failure patients. PARTICIPANTS 293 patients (149 interventions, 144 controls) diagnosed with heart failure were included after emergency admission. INTERVENTION Two home visits by one of 17 community pharmacists within two and eight weeks of discharge. Pharmacists review medications and provide symptom self-management and lifestyle advice. Controls received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was total hospital readmissions at six months. Secondary outcomes included mortality and quality of life (living with Minnesota heart failure questionnaire and EQ-5D). RESULTS Primary outcome data were available for 291 participants (99%). 136 (91%) intervention patients received one or two visits. There were 134 admissions in the intervention group compared to 112 in the control group (odds ratio=1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.48""; P=0.28, Poisson model). Compared with 24 controls, 30 intervention patients died (hazard ratio=1.18). 0.69 to 2.03; P=0.54.EQ-5D scores favored the intervention group, whereas Minnesota survey scores living with heart failure favored controls, with no difference being statistically significant.CONCLUSION This community pharmacist intervention was comparable in trials of specialist nurse-led interventions in heart failure. Given that heart failure accounts for 5% of hospitalizations, these results pose a challenge for policy makers who lack specialist service and hope that skilled community pharmacists can deliver the same benefits.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN59427925.",0,0,

669,"Effects of a multifaceted intervention on cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk hypertensive patients: the ESCAPE trial, a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in general practice.","BACKGROUND: Several observational studies in hypertensive patients have shown a gap between the therapeutic goals recommended in the guidelines and those achieved in daily practice. The ESCAPE trial aimed to determine whether a multifaceted intervention focused on general practitioners (GPs) would significantly increase the proportion of hypertensive patients at high risk in primary prevention who achieve all their recommended therapeutic goals. METHODS: A pragmatic cluster randomized trial involving 257 GPs randomized by site. General practitioners in the intervention group were given a one-day training session and were provided with an electronic blood pressure monitor and a short advisory leaflet. Along with usual follow-up, they focused on a consultation on hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors every six months for two years. They also received feedback on their patients' clinical and biological parameters at baseline and at one year. The main outcome measures were quality of life and change in the proportion of patients who achieved all their therapeutic goals and each individual therapeutic goal at two years. RESULTS: 1,832 high-risk hypertensive patients were included. After two years, the proportion of patients achieving all their therapeutic goals increased significantly in both groups, but was significantly greater in the intervention group: OR (ratio ratio) 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 3.27, P = 0.02). Significantly more patients achieved their blood pressure goals in the intervention group compared to the usual care group: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.88, P < 0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the usual care group by 4.8 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both). There was no significant difference in physical and mental quality of life between the groups. CONCLUSION: An easy-to-administer, multifaceted intervention targeting GPs only significantly increased the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients achieving their recommended therapeutic goals in primary prevention.

671,Effects of an automated electronic reminder on changing antiplatelet drug prescribing behavior among Italian GPs in diabetic patients: an intervention trial.,"OBJECTIVE – To evaluate whether an electronic reminder integrated into a routine computer system increases antiplatelet drug use for diabetic patients among Italian general practitioners (GPs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS – A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 300 GPs and their patients selected from the Health Search Database. Among these, 150 GPs (intervention group) received instructions to activate an electronic reminder and a letter summarizing the beneficial effects of antiplatelet drugs in diabetic patients with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor (“high risk”), while another 150 GPs (control group) only received the letter. The electronic reminder, integrated into a standard software system for the management of daily clinical practice, was displayed when each participating GP opened the medical records of diabetic patients age = 30. Only high-risk diabetes patients were included in the analysis. Patients who received two or more prescriptions at baseline and during follow-up were considered antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS-- We selected 15,343 high-risk diabetes patients, including 7,313 practitioners of the control group and 8,030 practitioners of the intervention group. Overall, 1,672 patients (22.9%) in the control group and 1,886 (23.5%) in the intervention group received antiplatelet drugs at baseline (P = NS). At the end of follow-up, the number of patients treated in the intervention group increased significantly compared to the control group (odds ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.79–2.22). The effect of the electronic reminder was more relevant among patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors but no prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with those with CVD. CONCLUSIONS—These findings provide evidence for the impact of electronic reminders in influencing GPs' prescriptive behavior.",1,1,

674,Effects of computer reminders for the flu shot on morbidity during flu epidemics.,"To examine the effects of computer-generated reminders for the flu shot of patients at high risk of lung disease during the winter months, we selected 4555 such patients from a population of 15,000 adults who participated in a three-year randomized trial of preventative care reminders. Physicians who received the reminders vaccinated eligible patients twice as often as control physicians (P = 0.0001). There was a linear increase in incidence of influenza in our region over the three winters studied (from 1,000 to 33,451 to 71,075 cases per year) and we modeled the percentage of patients hospitalized, emergency room visit with chest radiography, and blood drawn. Gas detections as a logistic function of this increase. The difference in linear trends between patients in the intervention group (reminders from physicians) and patients in the control group was significant for emergency department visits (P < 0.05), hospitalizations (P < 0.01), and blood gas determinations ( P < 0.001). ).

675,Effects of computer reminders on complications of peripheral venous catheters and nurses' adherence to a guideline in pediatric care - a cluster randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Reminder systems in electronic patient records (EPR) have been proven to affect both the behavior of healthcare professionals and patient outcomes. The purpose of this cluster randomized study was to investigate the effects of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) in the form of reminders integrated into EPRs for peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) in pediatric care, on PVC-related complications and registered health issues. nurses (RNs) declared their adherence to the guideline. An additional aim was to examine the relationship between contextual factors and outcomes of the intervention. METHODS: The study included 12 inpatient units in a pediatric university hospital. Reminders included PVC selection, hygiene, maintenance and daily inspection of the PVC site. The primary outcome was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications on removal from the EPR. The secondary outcome was RNs adherence to a PVC guideline, collected through a questionnaire that also included RNs' perceived working context, as measured by the Alberta Context Tool. The units were divided into two layers according to the formation of the PVCs. A simple blind draw from each stratum randomized six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively. Units were not blind. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention, and the control group included 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. The RNs included at baseline were 212 (65.4%) and 208 (71.5%) post-intervention. RESULTS: No significant effect of computer reminders on PVC-related complications or RNs compliance with guideline recommendations was found. The baseline and post-intervention complication rates were 40.6% (95% CI 36.7-44.5) and 41.9% (95% CI 38.0-45.8) and 40.3% (95% CI 36.8-44.0) for the intervention group. ) and 46.9% (95% CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. Overall, the RNs' self-rated work context ranged from moderately low to moderately high, suggesting that conditions were less optimal for successful implementation to occur. CONCLUSIONS: Reminders may have benefited from accompanying a specific intervention targeting specific barriers, such as low frequency of recorded causes of removal, low adherence to daily inspection of PVC sites, and lack of regular feedback to RNs.

676,Implications of computerized guidelines for managing heart disease in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Electronic information systems have been proposed as a way to reduce medical errors of commission (doing the wrong thing) and negligence (not providing specified care). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of computer-based cardiac care recommendations. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial targeting primary care physicians and pharmacists. SUBJECTS: A total of 706 outpatients with heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Evidence-based cardiac care recommendations, approved by a panel of local cardiologists and general internists, were demonstrated to physicians and pharmacists when dealing with enrolled patients. MEASUREMENTS: Compliance with care recommendations, general and situation-specific quality of life, acute exacerbations of heart diseases, drug compliance, health care costs, satisfaction with care, and physicians' attitudes towards guidelines. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 1 year, during which 3,419 primary care visits were made, and 2,609 individual cardiac care recommendations were eligible. The intervention had no effect on physician compliance with care recommendations (23% for intervention patients and 22% for controls). There were no intervention-control differences in quality of life, medication adherence, healthcare utilization, costs, or satisfaction with care. Physicians viewed the guidelines as providing useful information but limiting their application and not helping with decision-making for individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Care recommendations generated by an advanced electronic medical record system failed to improve compliance with accepted practice guidelines or outcomes for patients with heart disease. Future studies should weigh the benefits and costs of different (and perhaps more brutal) methods of influencing clinician behavior.",1,1,
677,The effects of general practitioner training and family support services on the care of dementia patients living at home-results of a controlled cluster-randomized study,"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of people with dementia are cared for by their general practitioner, who is committed to diagnosis, treatment and advice of support services. OBJECTIVE: To test whether specific training of general practitioners is changing the care of people with dementia through caregiver counseling and systematic recommendations from support groups. METHODS: 129 GPs enrolled 390 dementia patients and their informal caregivers in a prospective, three-arm cluster randomized 2-year study. Usual care making up Arm A was recommended by GPs in Arms B and C support groups, and caregiver counseling (one year after baseline in Arm B, initially in Arm C). General practitioners received branch-specific training. Diagnostic and therapeutic behaviors of physicians were recorded at baseline. Informal caregivers were questioned about using support services after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic behaviors of general practitioners are in accordance with the relevant guidelines. The procedure performed in newly diagnosed patients is not different from previously diagnosed patients, except for the rate of referral to a specialist. About one-third of newly diagnosed dementia patients are given an anti-dementia medication. Use of support groups and counseling increased five and fourfold, respectively. Except for home care and institutional short-term nursing, utilization of other support services remained low (< 10%). CONCLUSION: Trained general practitioners generally act according to the guidelines for the diagnosis of dementia and partially according to the guidelines regarding the recommended drug therapy. Informal recommendations of support services for caregivers by the general practitioner are successful. They cause a significant increase in the rate of use of the recommended services compared to offers not recommended by the general practitioner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN68329593.",0,0,
678,Effects of interactive voice response self-monitoring on natural resolution of drinking problems: Use and behavioral economic factors.,"Purpose: Most problem drinkers do not seek help and many get better on their own. A randomized controlled trial evaluated whether self-monitoring of the supportive interactive voice response (IVR) facilitates such ""natural"" solutions. Based on behavioral economics, it has been assumed that the effects on drinking outcomes vary with the baseline ""time horizon"" of drinkers, reflecting preferences among goods of different value available at different lags and their IVR use. Methods: Recently resolved, untreated problem drinkers were randomized to a 24-week IVR self-monitoring program (n = 87) or an assessment-only control condition (n = 98). Baseline interviews evaluated outcome predictors, including behavioral economic measures of reward preferences (deferral discount, alcohol versus pre-resolution monetary allowance, and savings). Six-month outcomes were categorized as definitive abstinence, resolved non-fasting, unresolved, or incomplete. Complier mean causal effects (CACE) models examined the self-monitoring effects of IVR. Results: IVR self-monitoring compliant subjects (>=70% scheduled search completed) were older and had greater pre-resolution drinking control and lower discount than ineligible subjects (<70%). A CACE model interaction showed that observed adherents with shorter time horizons in the IVR group (expressed by greater pre-resolution expenditure on alcohol rather than savings) were more likely to achieve moderate solutions than predicted adherents in the control group with shorter time horizons. and with all those who don't. The intent-to-treat analytical models showed no effect on IVR. More balanced spending for savings versus alcohol estimated moderation in both approaches. Conclusions: IVR interventions should consider factors that influence IVR use and drinking outcomes, including individual behavioral economic variables. CACE models provide tools for evaluating interventions that include extended participation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,

681,Efficacy and safety of sucrose for procedural pain relief in preterm and term neonates,"BACKGROUND: Premature and acutely ill neonates hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit undergo a number of frequently invasive and painful procedures aimed at improving outcomes. Although several studies have been developed to determine the efficacy of sucrose for managing procedural pain in preterm and acutely ill neonates, they often lack methodological rigor and have not provided clinicians with clear practice guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of three interventions for relieving procedural pain associated with heel spears in preterm and term neonates and to explore the impact of contextual factors on pain responses, including gender, disease severity, and prior painful procedures. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 190 newborns were classified by gestational age and then randomized to receive (a) sucrose and non-nutritive sucking (n = 64), (b) sucrose alone (n = 62), or (c) sterile water. was done. and non-nutritive sucking (control) (n = 64) to assess efficacy (pain response measured using the Premature Infant Pain Profile) (Stevens, Johnson, Petryshen, & Taddio, 1996) and safety (adverse effects) after a scheduled heel lance (n = 64) in the first week of life . Stratification was used to control for the effects of age on the pain response. RESULTS: There were significant differences in pain response between treatment groups (F = 22.49, p < .001), with the lowest mean Premature Infant Pain Profile scores in the sucrose and non-nutritive sucking group. The efficacy of sucrose following a heel spear was not affected by disease severity, postpartum age, or the number of painful procedures. Intervention group and gender explained 12% of the variance in Premature Infant Pain Profile scores. Few adverse events occurred (n = 6) and none of them required medical or nursing intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sucrose and non-nutritive suction is the most effective intervention for sole heel spears.

683,The effectiveness of cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy administered by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder: a research protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Contrary to the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines, the most common treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders in primary care is pharmacological. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral psychological intervention applied by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder compared to usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled study with two parallel groups. A random sample of 246 patients with mild-to-moderate mixed anxiety-depressive disorder will be drawn from the target population in the lists of 41 primary care physicians. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group that will receive standard cognitive-behavioral therapy combined with usual care by psychologists, or a control group to receive usual care alone. The cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention consists of eight individual 60-minute face-to-face sessions conducted over eight consecutive weeks. A follow-up session will be conducted by telephone 6 months after the intervention for reinforcement or referral as needed. The primary outcome variable will be the change in Short Form-36 General Health Questionnaire scores. We will also measure the change in frequency and intensity of anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. Additionally, we will collect information about drug use and healthcare. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of primary care-based cognitive-behavioral psychological intervention in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. International scientific evidence has shown the need for psychologists in primary care. But given the differences between health policies and health services, it is important to test the impact of these psychological interventions in our geographic setting.

DESIGN Randomized, participant and single evaluator blinded, placebo-controlled study. SETTING Melbourne metropolitan area, Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 120 participants with chronic (>3 months) rotator cuff disease recruited from medical practitioners and the community. INTERVENTIONS Active treatment consisted of a manual therapy and home exercise program""; it included placebo therapy, inactive ultrasound therapy, and an inert gel application. Participants in both groups received 10 sessions of individual standard therapy over 10 weeks. During the following 12 weeks, the active group home continued exercise program and placebo group did not receive treatment MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes, pain and function as measured by shoulder pain and disability index, mean pain with movement measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale, and participants' perceived global rating of overall change RESULTS 112 (93%) participants 22 completed the weekly trial. At 11 weeks, there was no difference between groups for change in shoulder pain and disability index (3.6, 95% confidence interval -2.1 to 9.4) or change in pain (0.7, -0.1 to 1.5);"" Both groups showed significant improvements. More participants in the active group reported a successful outcome (defined as ""much better""), although the difference was not statistically significant: 42% (24/57) of active participants and 30% (18/61) of placebo participants ( relative risk 1.43, 0.87 to 2.34). The active group had significantly greater improvement in shoulder pain and disability index than the placebo group at 22 weeks (group difference 7.1, from 0.3 to 13.9%), but there was no significant difference between groups for change in pain (0.9, -0.03 to 0.03 to 1.7). or for the percentage of participants reporting a successful treatment outcome (relative risk 1.39, 0.94 to 2.03). Several secondary outcomes favored the active group, including shoulder pain and disability index function score, muscle strength, activity intervention, and quality of life. CONCLUSION A standardized manual therapy and home exercise program did not provide additional immediate benefits for pain and function compared to a realistic placebo treatment controlling therapist contact in middle-aged to older adults with chronic rotator cuff disease. However, greater improvements were seen at follow-up, particularly in shoulder function and strength, suggesting that benefits take longer to appear with active treatment.

688,Effectiveness of guidelines and training program: an educational process for diagnosing low back pain,"BACKGROUND: The National Health Plan of Italy included low back pain (LBP) among the pathologies for which clinical guidelines should be established and disseminated. A change in the clinical behavior of doctors requires forms of intervention whose efficacy is not fully known. OBJECTIVES: This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention, including training materials, lectures, workshops, and local consensus processes, to change the clinical treatment of General Practitioners (GPs) LBP. METHODS: Changes in diagnostic capacity were assessed through a controlled (before/after) trial based on the frequency of aetiological diagnoses of LBP, testing of clinical knowledge with multiple choice tests, and priorities given in facing treatment problems of LBP. three groups of general practitioners who voluntarily participated in the study. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in diagnostic capacity (frequency of definitive answers in the multiple choice test) was obtained. There has also been a shift in priorities from diagnosis as the primary concern prior to intervention to communicating with the patient in facing issues in LBP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In the Italian context, the study also confirms the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on an educational process aimed at changing the GP's clinical behavior relative to the LBP.",0,0,
689,EHRA research network surveys: 6 years of EP wires effectiveness,"Clinical practice should follow guidelines and recommendations based mostly on the results of controlled studies conducted in selected populations and in specific conditions, whereas clinical practice may be influenced by factors different from controlled scientific studies. Therefore, the real-world setting is better appreciated by observational registries that enroll patients for longer periods of time. However, this can be difficult, expensive and time consuming. In 2009, the Scientific Initiatives Committee of the European Heart Rhythm Society (EHRA) initiated a series of research covering controversial issues in clinical electrophysiology (EP). With this in mind, an EHRA EP research network has been created that includes EP centers in Europe and distributes questionnaires on 'hot topic' among them. This review focuses on increasing participation in surveys and the research needs and expectations of the European EP community.",0,0,
690,Electronic alerts to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients,"BACKGROUND Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients is not used adequately. We hypothesized that the use of a computer alerting program to induce prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in high-risk hospitalized patients. METHODS We developed a computer program linked to a patient database to identify consecutive hospitalized patients at risk for deep vein thrombosis in the absence of prophylaxis. The program used medical record numbers to randomly assign 1255 eligible patients to an intervention group where the responsible physician was warned of a patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis, and 1251 patients to a control group where no warning was given. The physician had to accept the warning and could then stop or order prophylaxis including graduated compression stockings, pneumatic compression boots, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or warfarin. The primary endpoint was clinically diagnosed, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days. RESULTS More patients in the intervention group than the control group received either mechanical prophylaxis (10.0 percent versus 1.5 percent, P<0.001) or pharmacological prophylaxis (23.6 percent versus 13.0 percent, P<0.001). The primary endpoint occurred in 61 patients (4.9 percent) in the intervention group and 103 patients (8.2 percent) in the control group”; Kaplan-Meier estimated the probability of surviving deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism 94.1 percent at 90 days, respectively. (95 percent confidence interval, 92.5 to 95.4 percent) and 90.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88.7 to 92.2 percent) (P<0.001) Computer warning reduced risk of deep vein thrombosis or 41 percent pulmonary embolism (hazard ratio) at 90 days , 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81;"" P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS A computer alerting program institution has increased physicians' use of prophylaxis and significantly reduced rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in hospitalized at-risk patients.",1,1,
691,Electronic alerts against optional decision support to improve dyslipidemia treatment: a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Indirect evidence shows that alerting users with clinical decision support systems changes behavior rather than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However, there are no randomized studies comparing these methods in a clinical setting. We examined the effect of both stimulus and optional decision support on the screening and treatment of dyslipidemia based on the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a clustered randomized study design, 38 Dutch general practitioners (77 physicians) and 87,886 patients (39,433 men aged 18 to 70 years and 48,453 women aged 18 to 75 years) using the ELIAS electronic health record participated. Each application is designated to receive alerts, optional support, or non-interference. We measured the percentage of patients screened and treated after 12 months of follow-up. In the alert group, 65% of patients requiring screening were screened (relative risk vs. control = 1.76""; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 2.20), compared to 35% of patients in the discretionary group (relative risk vs. control = 1.28; 95%). confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.68) and 25% of patients in the control group In the Alert group, 66% of patients requiring treatment were cured (relative risk = 1.40 compared to control; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.70 ) in the optional group compared with 40 (relative risk with control=1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.50) and 36% of patients in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The alert version of clinical decision support systems significantly improved screening and treatment performance for dyslipidemia by general practitioners.",1,1,
692,Electronic antibiotic management – reduced consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics using a computerized antimicrobial approval system in a hospital setting.,"Objectives Antibiotic management is important, but the ideal strategy for management in a hospital setting is unknown. A practical, sustainable and transferable strategy is needed. This study evaluates the impact of a new computerized antimicrobial approval system on antibiotic prescribing behavior in a hospital. The effects on drug consumption, antibiotic resistance patterns of local bacteria and patient outcomes were monitored. Methods The study was conducted at a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The system was commissioned in January 2005 and guided the use of 28 restricted antimicrobials. Data were collected over 7 years: 5 years before and 2 years after distribution. Reception of the system was evaluated using a built-in audit trail. Drug use was prospectively monitored using pharmacy data (as defined daily doses per 1000 bed-days) and analyzed by time series analysis with segmental linear regression. Antibiograms of local bacteria were evaluated prospectively. In-hospital mortality and length of stay have also been reported in patients with gram-negative bacteremia. Results Between 250 and 300 confirmations per month were recorded during 2006. Third and fourth generation cephalosporins (+0.52, -0.05, -0.39""; P < 0.01), glycopeptides (+0.27, -0.53; P = 0.09), carbapenems (+0.12, -0.24; P = 0.21), aminoglycosides (+ 0.15, -0.27; P < 0.01) and quinolones (+0.76, +0.11; ""P = 0.08) decreased after deployment, whereas Extended-spectrum penicillin use increased. Trends in increased susceptibility to methicillin of Staphylococcusaureus and increased susceptibility of Pseudomonas spp. Many antibiotics have been found.

693,Electronic e-isotretinoin prescription chart: increasing physicians' adherence to isotretinoin prescribing guidelines,"Oral isotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for resistant nodulocystic acne. However, it can be associated with serious side effects such as teratogenicity and hepatitis. Inadequate cumulative dose may also result in decreased therapeutic efficacy and higher disease relapse. A preliminary audit had previously revealed poor and inconsistent adherence by doctors to local isotretinoin prescribing guidelines. Key areas and reasons for non-compliance were identified to achieve greater than 90% compliance with isotretinoin guidelines for all acne patients prescribed systemic isotretinoin at the Singapore National Skin Center. A specially designed 'one-stop' electronic isotretinoin chart has become available within the electronic medical records (EMR) system to address key safety areas"";"" that is, informed consent, pregnancy testing, baseline laboratory tests, and automated calculation of cumulative and target isotretinoin doses. Physician compliance with prescribing guidelines improved from a baseline of 50-60% to over 90% (range 95-100%) over 30 months post-intervention. The e-isotretinoin chart has resulted in a significant improvement in physicians' adherence to isotretinoin prescribing guidelines and highlights the utility of EMR technology in influencing safe prescribing behavior among physicians.",0,1,
694,Electronic health record decision support and quality of care for children with ADHD.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of electronic health record (EHR) decision support on physician management and documentation of care for children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: This study included 79 general pediatricians caring for 412 children aged 5 to 18 years and previously diagnosed with ADHD in 12 pediatric primary care settings using the same EHR. We conducted a cluster randomized trial of EHR-based decision support that included (1) clinician reminders to assess ADHD symptoms every 3 to 6 months, and (2) an ADHD note template with structured fields for symptoms, treatment efficacy, and side effects. The main outcome measures were (1) the proportion of children visited during the 6-month study period in which ADHD was assessed, and (2) the quality of documentation of the ADHD assessment. Generalized prediction equations were used by providers to control clustering. RESULTS: Children in intervention areas were more likely to visit during the study period when their ADHD was assessed. The ADHD template was used in 32% of visits where patients were specifically scheduled for ADHD assessment, and its use was associated with better documentation of symptoms, treatment efficacy, and treatment side effects. CONCLUSIONS: EHR-based decision support increased the likelihood that children with ADHD would receive care and visits to manage the condition. A better understanding of decision support and how to optimize provider usage of templates can drive further improvements in maintenance.",0,1,

696,Electronic health record-based decision support to improve asthma care: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Asthma remains one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, affecting _x0001_6 million US children. Although National Asthma Education Prevention Program guidelines exist and are widely accepted, previous studies have shown poor clinician adherence in various populations. We sought to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) embedded in an electronic health record (EHR) would improve clinician adherence to national asthma guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cluster randomized study in 12 primary care centers over a 1-year period. Applications are tiered for analysis based on whether the site is urban or suburban. Children 0 to 18 years of age with persistent asthma are defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for asthma. 6 intervention-implementation sites had CDS alerts embedded in the EHR. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of children with at least 1 prescription for controller medication, an updated asthma care plan, and office-based spirometry performance. RESULTS: Increases in the number of prescriptions for control drugs were 6% more over time (P .006) in intervention urban practices and 3% more for spirometry (P .04). Completion of a current asthma care plan improved by 14% (P .03) and spirometry by 6% (P .003) in suburban practice with the intervention.

699,Electronic Laboratory Medicine order with evidence-based Layout sets in primary care (ELMO study): protocol for a cluster randomized trial,"Background Laboratory testing is an important clinical action with a valuable role in screening, diagnosis, management and monitoring of diseases or treatments. However, improper laboratory test ordering is frequent, burdens healthcare costs, and negatively impacts quality of care. Improper testing can also cause false positive results and potentially lead to excessive downstream activities. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have shown promising results for influencing doctors' test requesting behavior and improving compliance. Order sets, a form of CDSS in which a limited set of evidence-based tests are recommended for a number of indications, integrated into a computerized physician order entry (CPOE), have been shown to be effective but convincing in reducing the volume of laboratory tests ordered. There is no evidence that it affects compliance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of order sets on the quality and quantity of laboratory test orders by physicians. We also aim to evaluate the impact of sequence sets on diagnostic error and explore the impact on downstream or cascade activities. Methods We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in Belgian primary care practice. The study was powered to measure two outcomes. We will first measure the impact of our CDSS on the compliance of the lab test order. Additionally, we will measure the impact on diagnostic error. We will also explore the effects of our intervention on cascading activities due to the varying results of inappropriate testing. Discussion We designed a study that should be able to show whether CDSS for diagnostic testing not only affects eligibility, but also whether it is safe for diagnostic error. These findings will impact wider, nationwide implementation of this CDSS. Trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02950142.",0,0,
700,Electronic medical records to increase clinical treatment of tobacco addiction: a systematic review.,"CONTEXT: The expanded use of electronic medical records (EMRs) may provide an opportunity to increase the use and impact of clinical guidelines to promote tobacco cessation treatment in primary care settings. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence for such an effect. EARNING EVIDENCE: After a systematic search of the English-language literature on the impact of EMR on smoking cessation or clinician behavior, relevant articles are summarized and findings are summarized from both observational studies and RCTs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the ten identified studies on PROMs and tobacco, only two RCTs were found. The addition of tobacco status as a vital marker has resulted in an increase in recommended actions in some clinical guidelines, particularly in documenting smoking status. There was insufficient evidence to quantify the effect of EMR on changes in patients' smoking behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Although the use of EMRs to provide feedback or guide the clinical management of tobacco addiction has shown some promising results, significant additional research is needed to understand the effects of EMRs on provider and patient behavior.",0,1,

METHODS Electronic case records and prescription charts (electronic or paper) of 502 hospitalized medical wards at a large Swiss teaching hospital between January 2009 and January 2010 were reviewed by four assistants and four senior clinical pharmacologists. Drug-related problems were identified and interventions recommended. The implementation and time delays of these suggested interventions were compared between patients using paper medication charts and patients using electronic medication charts. RESULTS In 109 hospitalizations, 158 drug-related problems were identified and 145 recommendations were made, 51% of which were implemented. Applicants with an electronic prescription chart (n = 90) were found to have 2.74-fold higher rates for applying change than a paper prescription chart (n = 53) (95% confidence interval 1.2, 6.3, P = 0.018, adjusted patient, ward, or clinic) "";"" for any addiction revealed by the team (follow-up for two missing cases).

Computer-generated reminders improve guide usage, but these systems often do not achieve high guide usage rates. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that computer-generated, individualized feedback on adherence to care guidelines would significantly improve clinician adherence to guideline recommendations delivered through a computer-assisted management protocol. Half of 45 primary care clinicians working in a primary care clinic affiliated with an academic medical center were randomized to receive a biweekly email message consisting of a computer-generated report summarizing their response to care guide recommendations for diabetic patients seen. during the previous 2 weeks. Clinician adherence to guideline recommendations was the primary outcome measure. This study demonstrated that the intervention significantly increased clinician adherence to guideline recommendations without incurring high costs of care. The median agreement among the intervention group was 35%, while it was 6.1% among the control group (p < 0.01). Electronically distributed, computer-generated, personalized feedback on the clinician's use of care guide recommendations is an effective way to increase adherence to a care guide.",0,1,

We used additional search methods: reviewing reference lists and contacting authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, controlled quasi-randomized trials before and after trials, and discontinuous time series studies examining interventions where healthcare professionals use e-mail to convey clinical information in the following ways: 1) unsecured e-mail, 2) secure e-mail, or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers in all settings were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. We contacted the study authors for additional information and reported all precautions according to the study report. MAIN RESULTS: The previous version of this review included a randomized controlled trial involving 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers at baseline. He compared an email containing patient-specific osteoporosis risk information and an email containing assessment and treatment guidelines with usual care (no email). This study was at high risk of bias for separation hiding and blanking areas. The email reminder significantly changed the actions of healthcare professionals, and professionals were more likely to provide the osteoporosis treatment recommended in the guideline (bone density measurement or osteoporosis medication or both) compared to usual care. Evidence for its effect on patient behavior or actions was inconclusive. One measure found that the electronic medical reminder message positively affected patient behavior (patients had a higher calcium intake), and the two found no difference between the two groups. The study did not evaluate health care outcomes or harms. No new work has been identified for this update. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Only one study was identified for inclusion, providing insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice regarding the use of email for clinical communication among healthcare professionals.

705,Emergency mental health nursing for self-harming refugees and asylum seekers,"This article describes the structure and function of emergency mental health nursing practice for self-harming refugees and asylum seekers on Temporary Protection Visas. Emergency nurses working in accident and emergency services or as part of crisis response teams will see refugees and asylum seekers at their most distressing point. This clinical article aims to support nurses in their practice when they encounter an adult asylum seeker who needs urgent mental health care. Practical strategies are highlighted to help mental health nurses assess, care for and comfort these vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers. When dealing with mental and emotional health issues, mental health nurses should work closely with asylum seekers, their support workers, and accredited interpreters and interpreters, where possible, to ensure the appropriate use of language without further isolating the refugee from appropriate services. To help strengthen the continuity and integration of mental health support for refugees and asylum seekers, well-resourced care must be experienced in a coherent and connected way.

706,Empowering patients or general practitioners? A randomized clinical trial to improve the quality of reproductive health care in Belgium.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical guidelines on contraceptive use were developed and distributed among all Flemish general practitioners (GPs) in Belgium. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for implementing a guideline on oral contraceptives to improve the quality of initial contraception consultation in general practice, either by empowering patients or introducing a computer decision support system (CDSS). METHODS: A random sample of 45 GPs was distributed to three study groups. One group was visited by 'empowered patients', one group's electronic medical record was supplemented with a CDSS, and one group served as a control group. Simulated patients (SPs) evaluated GPs' performance in daily practice before and after interventions using a validated 48-point checklist. RESULTS: The mean initial score of 43 GPs was 26.16 (SD = 5.76). SPs received adequate information on correct pill use, but not on factors related to pill failure and drug interaction. After intervention, the mean score of GPs was 26.39 (SD = 6.86). Only the 'empowered patient' intervention group scored significantly better (29.92 [SD = 7.11]). The computer group and control group scored lower (24.36 [SD = 6.60] and 24.82 [SD = 5.65], respectively).

707,It seems possible to encourage post-stroke patients to be active: results of an intervention study with knowledge brokers,"OBJECTIVE: Although physical activity and exercise are strongly recommended for rapid recovery for stroke patients, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centers are not sufficiently encouraged to be physically active. In this study, we investigated the impact of information brokers (KBs), enterprising nurses, and therapists on the performance of healthcare workers (HPs) to encourage stroke inpatients to be physically active. METHODS: This multicenter intervention study used a pre-post test design. Two or three PDs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by patients and HPs before and after the BP intervention. The primary outcome was the incentive given by HPs to their patients to be physically active, as reported by patients and HPs. RESULTS: After KB intervention, significantly more patients (48%""; N=217) reported at least some incentive to be physically active by HPs (26%;"" N=243, p<0.000). HPs (N=288) reported, on average, encouraging patients more frequently after intervention, but this difference was significant only for occupational therapists and BPs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on patient reports of HP behavior, BP-intervention appears to be effective as more patients feel encouraged to be physically active after the intervention than before. This study needs to be repeated in an experimental design to allow for causal inferences. Implications for rehabilitation As BP-intervention has been shown to increase the incentive that stroke patients feel to be physically active, we recommend that rehabilitation teams make use of information brokers (KBs). More frequent involvement of physicians, nurses, and patient families in efforts to encourage stroke patients to be physically active seems beneficial.",0,0,
708,Improved application of low back pain guidelines in general practice: study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines can improve treatment quality, but adoption of guideline recommendations is often incomplete and slow. New low back pain guidelines are being launched in Denmark recently. Guidelines are thought to reduce personal and public costs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a complex, versatile implementation strategy of low back pain guidelines could reduce secondary care referral and improve patient outcomes compared to the usual simple implementation strategy. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-arm randomized cluster study will enroll 2,700 patients aged 18 to 65 years, from 100 general practices (clusters) and the northern Danish region. Applications are randomly allocated 1:1 to a simple or complex application strategy. Intervention practices will take a complex implementation strategy, including guideline facilitator visits, classification tools, and quality reports on low back pain management. The primary outcome is referral to secondary care. Secondary outcomes are pain, physical function, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction with care and treatment outcomes, employment status, and sick leave. Primary and secondary outcomes are related to patient level. Evaluation of results is blind and follows the principle of treating. In addition, a process assessment will assess the degree to which intervention items were implemented as planned, and also measure changes in beliefs and behaviors among GPs and patients. DISCUSSION: This study provides information on the process and impact of an intervention to implement low back pain guidelines in general practice and will provide insight into key elements to include in future implementation strategies in general practice.

709,Physicians' adherence to antibiotic use guidelines has been enhanced through increased availability of guidelines when ordering medication in the hospital setting.,"Purpose Some research has shown that physicians' access to practice guidelines when making clinical decisions can improve prescribing practices. The aim of the study was to evaluate the benefit of the intervention on physician compliance, which previously consisted of the placement of paper-based antibiotic guides in a teaching hospital's computerized physician order entry system. time to order antibiotics. Prior to the intervention, these guidelines were available in booklet form in all wards of the hospital. Methods Compliance with guidelines was assessed in 471 consecutive antibiotic orders for pneumonia, 104 immediately before intervention and 367 immediately after intervention. Evaluation criteria were: antibiotic selection according to the context of pneumonia acquisition, daily dose, planned duration of treatment. Antibiotic requests were evaluated at the beginning of antibiotic therapy. Results Intervention was followed by a significant decrease in the proportion of antibiotic orders that included at least one criterion for non-compliance with guidelines, by 51% (p?<?0.001) before intervention versus 33% after intervention, respectively. The proportion of unsuitable orders for daily antibiotic dose in the pre- and post-intervention period decreased by 12.2% and 26.9% (p?<?0.001) for planned treatment duration, 7.3% versus 18.3% (p?<?0.001), pneumonia acquisition The improvement in antibiotic selection according to the context did not reach statistical significance, 18.2% vs. 25%, respectively (p?=?0.12). Conclusion In this study, increased availability of antibiotic guidelines at the time of drug ordering, along with a periodic round of supplemental education, was associated with an increased physician compliance with these guidelines.

710,Increasing access to alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy and treatment in primary care settings: ADaPT-PC,"Only 7.8% of individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for past alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment in a given year. Most people with AUD are identified in primary care (PC) settings and referred to substance use disorders (SUD) clinics"";"" however, only a small proportion of those referred continue to receive treatment. Safe and effective pharmacological treatments for AUD exist, but they are rarely prescribed by PC providers. The aim of this study was to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention to integrate pharmacological AUD treatment options into PC settings. This article provides a detailed description of intervention design and evaluation components. Methods/design Three major Veteran Health Administration (VHA) facilities are participating in the response. The intervention targets stakeholder groups with specific strategies based on practice theory and prior research that has identified barriers to the implementation of AUD pharmacotherapy. Local SUD providers and primary care mental health integration (PCMHI) providers are trained to serve as local practice/clinical champions and receive external facilitation. PC providers access consultation from local and national clinical champions for case identification, educational materials, and a panel of patients with AUD in caseloads. Veterans diagnosed with AUD receive educational information in the mail just prior to a scheduled PC visit. The effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated via a discontinuous time series with matched controls to monitor the change in AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates at the facility level. Following StitlerÂ¡â¯'s four-step formative assessment (FE) strategy, FE methods include (1) developmental FE (pre-practice interviews with champions, computer providers, and Veterans), (2) practice-oriented FE (participation monitoring). facilitation meetings, academic elaboration efforts by local champions, and patient dashboard use), (3) progression-oriented FE (AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates and referral rates to PCMHI and SUD special care), and (4) interpretive FE (post-champions and PC providers) application conversations). Analysis of FE data will be driven by the Consolidated Framework for Application Research (CFIR). Discussion If proven successful, this implementation strategy will provide a repeatable, viable and relatively low-cost method of integrating AUD treatment services into PC settings, thereby increasing access to AUD treatment.",0,0,
711,Advancement of evidence-based diabetes and chronic disease control among local health departments: a multistage dissemination study with a tiered cluster randomized trial component.,"Background Diabetes and prediabetes rates are increasing in the United States, significantly affecting the quality and life expectancy of those diagnosed, and placing a financial burden on society. Early death and disability can be prevented through the implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs). Local health departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement diabetes control EBPPs because of their knowledge and focus on community-level needs, contexts and resources. However, there is a significant gap between the known diabetes control EBPPs and the actual diabetes control activities carried out by LHDs. The aim of this study was to determine how best to support the use of evidence-based public health for diabetes (and related chronic diseases) control among public health practitioners at the local level. Methods/design This article describes methods of a staggered cluster randomized trial and a two-stage study to evaluate public health information for diabetes control and dissemination strategies to increase uptake of EBPPs among LHDs. Phase 1 includes the development of measures to assess practitioner views and institutional supports for evidence-based public health, data collection using a national online survey of LHD chronic disease practitioners, and a needs assessment of factors influencing the uptake of diabetes control EBPPs among LHDs in the country. A state in the USA. Phase 2 includes conducting a cascade cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of dissemination strategies with local-level practitioners in LHDs to increase capacity and institutional support for evidence-based diabetes prevention and control. Twelve LHDs will be selected and randomly assigned to one of three groups undergoing usual practice to receive intervention (spreading) strategies at 8-month intervals"";"" Intervention time for groups ranged from 8 to 24 months. Response (dissemination) strategies may include multi-day face-to-face workshops, electronic information exchange methods, technical assistance through an information broker, and organizational changes to support evidence-based public health approaches. Evaluation methods include initial questionnaires and three cross time points, abstraction of local level diabetes and chronic disease control program plans and progress reports, and social network analysis to understand the relationships and contextual issues affecting EBPP adoption.",0,1,
712,Increasing mammography referral in primary care,"Background. This 1-year randomized study tested the effectiveness of behavioral techniques for increasing mammography referrals by primary care physicians in small community practices. Methods. Sixty-one applications were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) training control only, (2) training plus cue development using mammography chart stickers, and (3) training plus cue enhancement plus feedback and coin rewards. Quarterly chart audits of a defined sample (N= 11,716) of female patients 50 years of age and older were performed to document mammography referrals, completions, and compliance. Results. Dispatch and completion rates increased from the start to the first quarter and then gradually decreased. Overall, these rates were higher in the cuing condition than in the control condition. In contrast, compliance rates in both experimental conditions increased over the year, while remaining static in the control condition, demonstrating a strong and sustained effect for cue enhancement. Compliance increases were highest for older, non-white, second-specialty, practice-only, non-AMA physicians, no specialty training, and no board-certified physicians. Results. Graphic stickers can significantly increase the use of mammography in small community applications. These apps are an effective way to reach large numbers of older women who need mammography screening.",1,1,
713,Developing the African bioethics initiative,"OBJECTIVE: Medical ethics has existed since the time of Hippocrates. However, formal training in bioethics was not established until a few decades ago. Bioethics has gained a strong foothold in the health sciences in the developed world, particularly in Europe and North America. In many developing countries the situation is quite different. In most African countries, bioethics - as established and practiced in the West today - is either non-existent or primitive. DISCUSSION: Although bioethics has matured in developed and some developing countries, it is still largely ""foreign"" to most African countries. Several bioethics conferences have been held in parts of Africa over the past decade to raise awareness of research ethics and ensure compliance with international guidelines for research with human participants. This idea was born out of recognition of the real need for capacity building to review research ethics in Africa. It is also a required condition by external sponsors of collaborative research in Africa. The awareness and interest these conferences evoke need to be further strengthened and extended beyond research ethics to clinical practice. In general, bioethics education in schools that train doctors and other healthcare providers is the hook that anchors both research ethics and clinical ethics. SUMMARY: This paper reviews the current state of bioethics in Africa as it applies to research ethics workshops and suggests that, despite current efforts to integrate ethics into biomedical research in Africa, much remains to be done to achieve this. A more comprehensive approach to bioethics with an all-encompassing benefit is to integrate formal ethics education into health education institutions in Africa.",0,0,
714,Development of developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening algorithm in children aged 5 to 5 years,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 2006 American Academy of Pediatrics developmental surveillance and screening algorithm is adequate or needs revision. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to investigate a clinician's ability to conduct developmental-behavioral surveillance of children aged 0 to 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Even when a broadband developmental screening is typical, pediatricians should refer when they confidently suspect a delay, but be much more skeptical about children who appear asymptomatic. Periodic screening improves surveillance by improving early detection and early intervention (EI) eligibility rates. However, children with relevant screens are not consistently referred to and linked to EI. After referral, about half do not qualify for EI, although they typically perform well below average and have multiple, predictive academic and psychosocial risk factors. Meanwhile, clinicians are struggling to keep track of at-risk children. CONCLUSION: Revisions are needed to optimize early detection, prevention and monitoring. More emphasis is needed on developmental-behavioral promotion and referral care coordination.",0,0,
715,Improving the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care: a qualitative assessment of a blended learning intervention.,"BACKGROUND: The Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) Training Program aims to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing and raise awareness of antibiotic resistance among general medical practitioners. It consists of a seven-part theory-based blended learning program that includes online reflection on clinicians' own practice, presentation of research evidence and guidelines, a practice-based seminar focusing on participants' own antibiotic prescriptions and resistance rates in externally sent urine samples. applications, communication skills training using videos of simulated patients during routine surgery, and participation in a web forum. Efficacy was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial involving 244 GPs and Nurse Practitioners and 68 general practitioners. This document reports part of the process evaluation of that trial. METHODS: Semi-structured, digitally recorded and transcribed telephone interviews with 31 purposefully sampled trial participants analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported increased awareness of antibiotic resistance, greater self-confidence in reducing antibiotic prescribing, and at least some change in consultation style and antibiotic prescribing behavior. Practical changes reported have included the adoption of a practice-wide policy of antibiotic prescription reduction. Many GPs also reported increased insight into patients' expectations, which ultimately contributed to improving the doctor-patient relationship. Components of the intervention that were claimed to have the greatest impact on changing clinician behavior were up-to-date sources of research evidence, simple and effective communication skills presented in online videos, and presentation of practice combined with and of their own antibiotic prescribing levels. an overview of local resistance data. CONCLUSION: Participants found this complex blended learning intervention acceptable and feasible and reported wide-ranging, positive changes in attitudes and clinical practice as a result of participating in the STAR Education Program.

717,"Epidemiology of Alzheimer's presenile dementia in Scotland, 1974-88","OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiology of presenile Alzheimer's disease in Scotland from 1974 to 1988. DESIGN Retrospective review of hospital records of patients younger than 73 years old admitted to a psychiatric hospital with various dementia diagnoses. Diagnoses were classified according to the National Institute of Communication Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Associated Disorders Association Criteria and Hachinski score. The completeness of the study sample was assessed by reviewing neurology outpatient and general hospital records. SET All general psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. SUBJECTS All patients aged 40-64 years with onset of dementia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Possible and common Alzheimer's disease, patient's gender, age of onset. RESULTS 5874 psychiatric hospital records, 129 neurology outpatient records, and 89 records from non-psychiatry hospitals were analyzed. 317 patients met criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, 569 patients met broad Alzheimer's disease criteria, and 267 patients met criteria for multiple infarct dementia. The minimum incidences per 100,000 population aged 40-64 years were 22.6 (95% confidence interval, 20.2 to 25.2) and 40.5 (38.9 to 42.3) per 100,000 for probable and extensive Alzheimer's disease. In the 1981 census year, the annual incidence of probable Alzheimer's disease was 1.6 (1.0 to 2.6). Women were at greater risk with probable Alzheimer's disease incidence rates of 28.2 (24.5 to 32.4 per 100,000) compared with 16.5 (13.8 to 19.8) per 100,000 for men. The incidence of one in 100,000 for multiple infarct dementia was greater in men (25.1, 23.3 to 27.1) than women (13.4, 12.1 to 14.8). CONCLUSION Female gender appears to be positively associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease before the age of 65.",0,0,

720,ESHRE guideline: routine psychosocial care in infertility and medical assisted reproduction - a guide for fertility personnel,"STUDY QUESTION: Based on the best available evidence in the literature, what is the optimal management of routine psychosocial care in infertility and medical assisted reproduction (MAR) clinics? SUMMARY ANSWER: Using the structured methodology of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Guideline Development Guidelines, 120 recommendations were formulated answering 12 key questions regarding the optimal management of routine psychosocial care by all fertility staff. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: The 2002 ESHRE Guidelines for infertility counseling has for years been a reference point for the best psychosocial care in infertility, but this guideline needed updating and did not focus on routine psychosocial care that could be delivered by all fertility staff. OPERATION, DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This guide has been prepared by a group of experts in the field, according to the 12-step process described in the ESHRE Guideline Development Guide. After defining the scope of the guideline and listing a set of 12 key questions in the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) format, extensive systematic literature search was conducted"";"" Evidence from articles published up to April 2014 was collected, evaluated for quality, and analyzed. A summary of the evidence was written in response to each of the key questions and used as the basis for recommendations defined by consensus within the guideline development group (GDG). During the scoping and review phase of guideline development, patient and additional clinical input were collected. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, ENVIRONMENT, METHODS: The guide group, consisting of a psychologist, two medical doctors, a midwife, a patient representative, and a methodologist, met three times to discuss the evidence and agree on recommendations. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE WHAT THE GUIDE PROVIDES: 120 recommendations aimed at guiding fertility clinic staff in providing optimal evidence-based routine psychosocial care to patients dealing with infertility and MAR. The directive is written in two parts. The first section describes patients' preferences regarding the psychosocial care they want to receive in clinics and how this care relates to their well-being. The second part of the guide provides information on the psychosocial needs that patients experience along their treatment path (before, during and after treatment) and how fertility clinic staff can identify and address them. Needs refer to the conditions assumed to be necessary for patients to have a healthy experience in fertility treatment. Needs include behavioral (lifestyle, exercise, nutrition, and adjustment), relational (relationship with partner, family friends and wider network and work, if any), emotional (well-being, eg anxiety, depression, and quality of life), and cognitive (treatment concerns and knowledge). . LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We have identified many areas of care where solid evidence is lacking. Gaps in the evidence were addressed by formulating good practice points based on the GDG's expert opinion, but empirical validation of such recommendations is critical. LARGER IMPACT OF FINDINGS: The evidence presented in this guideline demonstrates that providing routine psychosocial care is associated with, or has the potential to, reduce stress and anxiety associated with medical procedures and improve lifestyle outcomes, fertility information, patient well-being, and adherence to treatment. . As only 45 (36.0%) of the 125 recommendations were based on high-quality evidence, the guideline group formulated recommendations to guide future research to increase the evidence.",0,0,
721,Key elements of early intervention service for psychosis: expert clinicians' opinions,"BACKGROUND: Early intervention teams seek to improve outcome in schizophrenia through early detection and provision of phase-specific treatments. While the number of early response teams is increasing, there is a lack of clarity on their key structural and functional elements. METHODS: A 'Delphi' study was conducted in a group of 21 UK specialist clinicians to determine how much consensus there was on key elements of early intervention teams. Using published guidelines, a starting list of 151 items from the ten categories of team structure and function was created. RESULTS: Overall, there was expert consensus on the importance of 136 (90%) of these elements. Of the agreed items, 106 (70.2%) were rated as necessary, meaning that their absence would seriously disrupt the functioning of the team. CONCLUSION: This level of consensus on the key elements makes it reasonable for UK early response teams to define a model from which a measure of fidelity can be derived.",0,0,
722,Fundamentals of research ethics for healthcare professionals,"Research with human subjects, whether conducted at a university or in the healthcare field, raises numerous ethical questions for healthcare professionals. As both clinicians and scientists engage in ongoing professional development in how to conduct research ethically, they need to broaden their knowledge to answer the following questions: Which ethical theories serve as the basis for ethical principles in research ethics? What ethical principles should a researcher respect when conducting research with human subjects? What does it mean to conduct research ethically? What ethical dilemmas does a researcher face while doing research? This article presents a review of ethical theories and the ethical foundations of guidelines developed and used to guide human subject research. The ethical behaviors and personal responsibility of the researcher who conducts research with human subjects in research designs and methods are discussed.",0,0,
723,Establishing translational and clinical cancer research collaborations between high- and low-income countries,"Associated malignancies, both communicable and non-communicable, are a growing problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Data and guidelines for cancer treatment from high-income countries (HIC) to cancer patients in the LMIC are difficult to estimate. Due to the increase in noncommunicable cancer rates, there is a growing gap between the need for evidence-based treatments for cancer control plans and current research capabilities. Surgeons often provide all surgical and medical oncology treatments to patients at LMIC for diseases such as breast, stomach, cervical and colorectal cancers. However, clinical and translational research collaborations in surgical oncology are lacking. There are several successful consortia focusing on HIV and infection-related malignancies. These collaborations can be used as examples of future surgical research efforts. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center-Nigeria collaboration focusing on colorectal cancer is used as an example of how to initiate a research collaboration that can build a research infrastructure and provide the data needed to create realistic treatment guidelines. The need for expanded surgical oncology research and the growing population of patients with non-infectious associated malignancies in LMIC have created a unique opportunity for surgeons to initiate and lead clinical and translational research collaborations between HIC and LMIC.",0,0,

725,Ethics and institutional review board issues,"IRBs provide an important role in protecting research subjects/patients. Research investigators by their very nature as healthcare professionals have a potential conflict of interest"";"" As physicians, they are committed to promoting the well-being of individual patients, whereas as researchers they seek information that can be generalized and applied to people other than the individual patient studied. The second goal may conflict with the first. IRBs have the greatest responsibility for protecting the rights and well-being of human research subjects. While the IRB system is not perfect, conscientious IRBs reassure the public that the rights and well-being of human subjects are seriously considered by those who do not have a vested interest in the outcome of the research. By fulfilling their responsibilities, IRBs promote the protection of human subjects. IRB approval provides substantial confirmation of the scientific and ethical qualities of research and therefore offers important validation to research and research researchers.

Changes to the American Psychological Association's Code of Ethics (American Psychological Association, 1992) raise ethical and legal issues that need to be considered by practitioners, researchers, and facility Institutional Review Boards.

727,Ethical complications of clinical therapeutic research on children,"The usual debate by ethicists and physicians about the ethical implications of research on catastrophically ill children and the guidelines established by the Federal Government for this research is based on the application of general moral principles to problems. Whatever the merits of this approach to policy-making, it does not adequately reflect the patients' living situation and the complexity of a single regimen that is simultaneously therapeutic and research-oriented. Also, problems become more complex when there is disagreement between parents about a course of treatment. We believe that such cases are appropriately resolved by considering the degree of paternalism to be applied by the clinician-researcher."";"" KIE: Much of the discussion of ethical issues in therapeutic research for children is based on the application of general moral principles to problem categories. The authors believe that this approach does not adequately address the complexity of a treatment regimen for disastrously ill children, both therapeutic and research-oriented.

732,Ethical issues in the management of chronic non-malignant pain,"Chronic pain is a challenge for patients, families, employers, and doctors who care for these individuals. Opioids remain the mainstay of analgesic drugs for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. Controlled-release preparations of morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and long-acting opioid agents such as methadone and levorphanol have been medically and ethically accepted in the treatment of chronic cancer pain. However, the continued use of these drugs in patients with non-cancer chronic pain is fiercely debated. This article attempts to reconcile the medical and ethical dilemma of using opioid drugs for non-cancer chronic pain. Increasing clinical experience in pain medicine has helped clarify the following: (1) a misunderstanding of addiction, physical dependence, and analgesic tolerance; (2) the misconception that chronic opioid therapy inevitably causes personality changes, depression, and cognitive and physical impairment. (3) lack of knowledge about the proper use of opioid analgesics with regard to titration and management of related side effects. Behavioral management of pain patients receiving chronic opioid therapy is also discussed. A protocol has been proposed for optimal patient management. Special attention is paid to the consent form, the behavioral contract, and the consequences of non-compliance. The importance of psychological evaluation before a long-term trial of opioids is emphasized to minimize future complications. Although most patients on the opioid regimen do well, special attention should be paid to patients with current addiction, past addiction history, or misuse of current opioid medication. Pharmacological and conservative interventions are usually warranted in patients with significant behavioral problems. If such strategies fail and chronic opioid therapy is deemed necessary, some treatment guidelines are offered.",0,0,
733,Ethical regulations for innovative surgery: the final frontier?,"BACKGROUND: Although there are general guidelines governing research with human subjects, there are no clear federal regulations governing innovative surgery. We hypothesized that US surgeons were unaware of Department of Health and Human Services regulations, rarely sought IRB review, were often opposed to external regulations of innovative surgery, and were unsure of what constituted innovation and research. These conditions, if true, would pose a significant ethical challenge and present potential harm to patients as unintentional research subjects. STUDY DESIGN: In a pilot study, we reviewed 527 issues of US surgical and medical journals, selecting 59 articles describing innovative surgery between 1992 and 2000. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to the corresponding authors from university hospitals (71%) and other facilities (29%). RESULTS: The survey was conducted between November 2000 and May 2001. Twenty-one questionnaires were returned, filled with responses, and an overall response rate of 35% was established. Fourteen authors approved of their work as research, but only six requested prior IRB review. Most of the authors (15 out of 21) did not submit their protocols to the IRB. Only seven authors mentioned the innovative nature of the procedure in the informed consent form. Seven authors claimed to be familiar with Office for Human Research Protections research and human subject definitions. Two-thirds of those surveyed said that innovative surgery would not be appropriate for government regulations to protect human subjects.

734,Ethical requirements that must be met before new procedures are implemented,"New approaches, both diagnostic and therapeutic, must be continually developed so that the orthopedic care of patients continues to evolve. These innovations need to be subjected to rigorous scientific study to confirm that a new approach does indeed deliver improved results. However, since the results of clinical interventions can only be studied in human subjects, these studies must not only meet scientific criteria, but also strict ethical criteria. The Declaration of Helsinki, a document prepared by the World Medical Association and first written in 1964, largely revised in 1975, and last revised in 1996, provides guidelines for such work. In addition to meeting ethical requirements, clinical researchers also face a variety of complex issues that must be addressed during the conduct of clinical research studies. One of the most difficult issues is the conflict between a doctor's concern for the well-being of his patients and the need for protocol-based trials. However enthusiastic surgeons may be about a new therapeutic approach, they must recognize that they are responsible for scientifically validating their innovative approach with a well-controlled clinical trial using valid functional outcome measures.",0,0,

737,Ethics committees and pediatric research: a personal perspective,"Surveillance of clinical trials involving child subjects or tissue from them continues to become more formal and complex. Many physicians and pediatricians can be expected to be offered the opportunity to serve on Pediatric Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs) at some stage in their professional lives. Fearless and independent Ethics Committees have significant influence on both the design and conduct of clinical trials and the permitted research topics in which infants and children will be involved. The composition of IECs is often designed to strike a balance between genders, professional backgrounds, and institutional and non-institutional affiliations. In addition to these now well-established composition guidelines, IECs deciding on pediatric research have a pragmatic need for three extra-specific roles: in loco parentis, in loco infanti, and the special role of nursing staff. These roles and their ethical bases are defined. Furthermore, the in loco parentis role is ethnically complex, and an IEC that takes this role into account should be clear about its implications. Pediatric research projects involve not only the specific risks specific to that project, but also the more general risks inherent in any clinical research intervention attempt itself. Pediatric IECs should act in an incentive mode rather than simply being 'physician observers' and insist ab initio on publication of results as a condition of permission to conduct the research in question. A particularly effective form of ethical review is the national and international peer review that follows such publications of pediatric research. This report discusses these particular themes in the evolving context of greater oversight of pediatric research.",0,0,

A year later, there was a sense that the new rules (i.e. decentralization and emphasis on pharmacological aspects of studies) had immediate impact among people involved in EC activities. negative. A prospective study was initiated to evaluate oncologists' views on the functioning of the Italian AT. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was administered twice to 110 oncologists who participated in two multicenter studies. Nine questions were included regarding the following aspects: hospital-level presence of an EC, personal experience with an EC, average time required to consider proposals submitted, and level of satisfaction with the key functions of the EC. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 93 (first questionnaire) and 69 (second questionnaire) clinicians. In both surveys, clinicians reported that they were satisfied with the scientific and ethical aspects of EC operation, but were dissatisfied with the educational activities and training as well as bureaucratic and clerical requirements. In the second survey, the average time required for evaluation after submission of a study protocol was approximately 2.4 months, and the level of dissatisfaction with some critical aspects such as bureaucracy (44%) and training activities and training (64%) was still high. . Analysis of change over time documented minor differences (-8% to +7%) in all aspects evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of this study, such as the small sample size and inherent characteristics of the Italian setting, the findings add empirical evidence regarding the functioning of local EC and the views of clinical investigators. This experience confirms that empirical studies on medical ethics are feasible and can generate useful information to facilitate the practice of EC in medicine and the lay community.",0,0,
739,"Innovative surgical ethics: definitions, knowledge, and attitudes of US surgeons","BACKGROUND: Innovative surgery is not clearly defined and not formally regulated by governing bodies, as is the case with drug and medical device development. This uncertain situation, and the subsequent questionable applicability of current federal guidelines for human subject research, raises ethical concern. To clarify his position, we asked US surgeons' definitions of, views, and attitudes towards innovative surgery. Surgeons were also invited to self-report information on current federal regulations guiding human subject research and guidelines for informed consent and IRB review for clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN: A group of US surgeons received a 46-item questionnaire that addressed the definition of innovative surgery versus research and practice-oriented, regulations for human subject research, the need for specific informed consent, and IRB review of surgical innovations. RESULTS: A total of 665 responses were used in the content analysis. Participants took a rather cautious stance when considering hypothetical innovative scenarios. The distinguishing features of experimentation and clinical research as modes of innovation were more clearly defined for the surgical situation. CONCLUSIONS: There are descriptive criteria that allow for previous review of surgical innovations and further investigation. Some forms of innovation clearly fall within the scope of existing regulations for human subject research"";"" others may not quite meet the definition but still require some additional oversight.",0,0,
740,The ethics of randomized clinical trials and the 'ALARA' approach,"A balanced discussion of the ethics of randomized clinical trials should not be based on a single ethical dimension, such as respect for patient autonomy. Instead, the analysis should consider four ethical principles—respect for autonomy, non-harming, beneficence, and justice—applicable to all human groups concerned. We present the ethical benefits and costs of current practice of randomized clinical trials for four groups: patients participating in clinical trials, patients not participating in trials, physicians participating, and the public. The ALARA (As Low as Reasonably Achievable) approach is then introduced and practical measures are proposed to strike a positive balance between the ethical benefits and the costs of randomized trials.",0,0,

742,"Research ethics with psychiatric patients: principles, issues and primary responsibilities of researchers","In this paper, some of the general issues surrounding recently published guidelines for the practice of research ethics committees are outlined, with a particular focus on the challenges that arise in research with psychiatric patients. Research departs from ordinary clinical practice with the intent to advance knowledge. Defined as such, research with psychiatric patients should be governed by the same four principles as research with other groups: knowledge, necessity, benefit, and consent. However, many acute difficulties arise by psychiatric patients in the application of these principles, particularly the principle of consent. A number of recommendations are discussed to address these challenges. Despite the value of published guidelines and the assistance available from research ethics committees, it is suggested that the primary responsibility for ensuring high standards of practice in research rests with research workers themselves.",0,0,
743,"EUROASPIRE III: A study on lifestyle, risk factors and use of cardioprotective drug therapies in coronary patients from 22 European countries.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events III (EUROASPIRE III) was to define lifestyle and to determine if the Partner European Societies' guidelines on cardiovascular prevention were followed in daily clinical practice. Risk factor and therapeutic management in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) in Europe. METHODS: The EUROASPIRE III study was conducted in 76 centers from selected geographical regions in 22 countries in Europe between 2006-2007. Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of CHD were identified retrospectively, and then followed, interviewed, and examined at least 6 months after their coronary events. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred and thirty-five medical records (27% women) were reviewed and 8966 patients were interviewed. At the interview, 17% of patients were smokers, 35% were obese and 53% were centrally obese, 56% had blood pressure >or=140/90 mmHg (>or=130/80 in diabetics), 51% had . diabetes with serum total cholesterol > or=4.5 mmol/l and 25%, fasting plasma glucose of 10% less than 6.1 mmol/l, and 35% of glycated hemoglobin A1c less than 6.5% reported the story. Cardioprotective drug use was: antiplatelets 91%""; beta blockers 80%; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers 71%;"" calcium channel blockers 25% and statins 78%. CONCLUSION: The EUROASPIRE III study shows that a large proportion of coronary patients do not meet lifestyle, risk factor and therapeutic goals for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. There are wide variations in risk factor prevalences and use of cardioprotective drug therapies between countries. There is still significant potential across Europe to raise the standards of preventive care to reduce the risk of recurrent disease and death in patients with CHD.",0,0,

METHODS AND RESULTS: EUROASPIRE IV is a cross-sectional study conducted at 78 centers from 24 European countries. Patients /= 6 months later. A total of 16,426 medical records were reviewed and 7998 patients (24.4% women) were interviewed. At the time of the interview, 16.0% of the patients were smokers and 48.6% of the smokers at the time of the event were permanent smokers. 59.9% reported little physical activity""; 37.6% were obese (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) and 58.2% were centrally obese (waist circumference >/= 102 cm in men or >/= 88 cm) women); 42.7% had blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg (>/=140/80 in people with diabetes); 80.5% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >/= 1.8 mmol/l and 26.8% had diabetes The cardioprotective drug was: anti-platelet 93.8%; beta blockers 82.6%; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 75.1%;"" and statins 85.7%. It was recommended that 50.7% of the patients participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and 81.3% of those recommended attended at least half of the sessions. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of coronary patients do not reach the guideline standards for secondary prevention with a high prevalence of persistent smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and as a result, most patients are overweight or obese with a high prevalence of diabetes. Despite the reported high drug use, risk factor control is poor and there is wide variation in secondary prevention practices between centers. Less than half of coronary patients have access to cardiac prevention and rehabilitation programs. All coronary and vascular patients need a modern preventive cardiology program, appropriately adapted to the medical and cultural settings in each country, to lead healthier lifestyles, better risk factor control and compliance with cardioprotective drugs.",0,0,
745,Evaluation of an educational intervention to improve asthma management in four European countries. Pharmaceutical Education Project Group,"In the International Pharmaceutical Education Project, a new training program for peer doctor groups was developed and tested to improve the management of asthma patients in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Slovakia. Individualized feedback on prescribing and underlying decision strategy was presented and discussed within the physicians group regarding current guidelines. The effect on efficacy and actual prescribing was tested in a parallel, randomized controlled design. The results were related to national guidelines. Overall, the program improved physicians' attitudes as well as some of their prescribing behaviors. The proportion of patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids improved significantly in the Netherlands (effect size 1.27) and the proportion of oral corticosteroid use for exacerbation treatment increased in both the Netherlands and Norway (effect sizes 1.99 and 0.87), respectively. Overall attitudes of Dutch and Norwegian physicians were also significantly improved in Slovakia, as were both knowledge (effect size 1.06) and attitudes (effect size 1.49) regarding exacerbation treatment (effect size 1.06 and 0.87, respectively). No significant improvement could be measured in Sweden. In conclusion, improvements in asthma treatment are possible with a self-learning education program in small peer groups, but effects in one healthcare setting may not occur in another healthcare setting. Possible explanatory factors may be differences in opportunities for change, including differing attitudes and experiences with guidelines, as well as continuing medical education programs and prevailing trends in prescribing behavior.",0,0,
746,"Evaluating informatics practices – some alternative approaches: theory, social interactionism and call for methodological pluralism","review of the evaluation literature on CDSSs shows that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the 'gold standard' for evaluation. While this approach is excellent for examining systems or clinical performance, it is not well suited for answering questions about whether or how systems should be used. As the non-use of CDSS has been a matter of concern for several years, further assessment research designs are needed to address these issues. This article critiques RCT and experimental evaluation approaches and presents alternative evaluation approaches that address questions outside the scope of usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide variety of literature has been summarized to demonstrate the value of assessments that consider social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond the usual measures of system performance or physicians' behavior, focusing on the 'fit' of the system with other aspects of professional and corporate life. Since there are few clear theories that inform most assessments, the article then reviews the CDSS assessments informed by social science theories. Finally, it proposes a theoretical social science basis of social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It includes a CDSS in psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs that focus on communication, control, care and context. While an exemplary CDSS, the assessment approach is also useful for clinical guide application and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, while the debate is about social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden assessment through a variety of methods and approaches that explore social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and diverse research questions can increase understanding of the many implications associated with the development and dissemination of informatics applications.",0,0,
747,"Evaluation of the efficacy of a clinical practice change intervention in increasing the delivery of clinician preventive care in a community-based mental health care network: a study protocol of a nonrandomized, multiple baseline trial.","BACKGROUND: People with mental illness experience significant inequalities in health, including increased morbidity and mortality rates caused by potentially preventable chronic diseases. A contributing factor to this disparity is the higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviors such as smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, harmful alcohol consumption, and insufficient physical activity. Evidence supports the effectiveness of preventive care in reducing such risks, and guidelines recommend incorporating preventive care for such risks into routine clinical care. Although community-based mental health services represent an important potential setting for enabling people with mental illness to receive this type of care, research currently suggests that delivery is sub-optimal. A study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention in providing routine preventive care by clinicians in community mental health settings. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-group multi-baseline design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention over 12 months in increasing clinician provision of preventive care. The intervention will be administered alternately between the two groups of community mental health services to provide client assessment, brief advice, and referral to the four health risk behaviors (smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol consumption, and insufficient physical activity). . Outcomes of interest will be collected through repeated cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted weekly for 36 months with community mental health patients. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of a very strategic clinical practice change intervention in increasing routine clinician preventive care provision for chronic disease behavioral risk factors within a community mental health services network. The results will inform future policy and practice regarding the ability of clinicians in mental health settings to improve preventive care delivery as a result of such interventions.

The primary aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of approaches to delirium education. A detailed search was carried out in educational and medical databases. The type of intervention used was classified according to Green et al's PRECEED model using factors related to behavior change in health promotion. The effectiveness of the intervention was determined by evaluating changes in staff performance and patient outcomes. Nineteen studies of variable design and quality were identified. Studies that used a combination of preparatory, enabler, and reinforcement strategies were more often effective in producing changes in staff behavior and patient outcomes. Training and instructions used together or in combination have little effect. Results are more positive for patients when strategies are used in conjunction with training sessions to enable and reinforce changes in clinical practice.",0,0,

This study used the Transtheoretical Model to examine barriers to screening before and after a lay health counselor (LHA) intervention (2005-2009) to increase cervical cancer screening rates. Ohio Appalachian women (n = 90) requiring Pap testing based on risk-appropriate guidelines were randomized to a 10-month LHA intervention and received two face-to-face visits, two phone calls, and four targeted postcards. to the participant's change phase. Findings revealed that 63% had advanced-stage movement 10 months after intervention. The most frequently reported screening barriers are time constraints, forgetting to make an appointment, and cost. Women who reported the following barriers—the doctor does not recommend testing; cannot afford testing; and fear of being embarrassed, nervous, or having a Pap test—were less likely to be in the action phase. Understanding the stages of change associated with Pap testing and the reported barriers among this underserved population encourages researchers and clinicians to can help inform this population's readiness for change and how to set realistic response goals.",0,0,
750,Evaluation of the impact and impact of the computerized decision support system NHGDoc on the quality of primary care: protocol for a large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support systems (CDSSs) are increasingly used to improve the quality of care. There is evidence of moderate to large effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but no evidence of their effectiveness when implemented at the national level. In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) launched its successful guide programs 30 years ago. NHGDoc, a multi-disease CDSS for general practice based on these NHG guidelines, was developed in 2006 to improve the quality of primary care. This manuscript presents a protocol for evaluating the uptake and effects of NHGDoc. METHODS: A cluster RCT will be conducted among 120 general practices in the Netherlands. Suitable generic applications will be randomly selected to receive either the regular NHGDoc decision support modules (control arm) or the regular modules, as well as an additional module on heart failure (intervention arm). The heart failure module consists of patient-specific alerts regarding the treatment of patients with heart failure. Impact assessment will focus on patient outcomes (eg hospital admissions) as well as performance indicators (eg, prescription behavior) related to the heart failure domain. In addition, a process assessment will be conducted to gain insight into barriers and facilitators affecting the uptake and impact of NHGDoc. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the uptake and impact of a multi-site CDSS for primary care implemented by a national guideline organization to improve the quality of primary care. While the trial focused on a specific area of care-heart failure, the results of this study will shed light on the functioning of CDSSs covering multiple disease domains for primary care, particularly as this study also investigated factors contributing to the uptake and efficacy of the system.

751,Evaluation of training methods to move emergency management to therapists,"The effects of three increasingly intense training methods on therapist use, knowledge, and adherence to the application of emergency management (CM) with substance-addicted adolescents were evaluated. Ten public sector substance abuse or mental health provider organizations were randomized to one of three training conditions: workshop and resources (WS+), WS+ and computer-assisted education (WS+/CAT), or WS+/CAT and audit support (WS+/CAT/ SS). . Among the conditions, 161 therapists participated in the training experiences and measurements were taken at baseline and at 2-month intervals for 12 months following workshop participation. Across the training conditions, therapists reported increased CM use, knowledge, and adherence to practice over the 12-month follow-up. The findings suggest that community-based practitioners are open to adopting evidence-based treatments when access to helpful resources is provided. In addition, high-quality workshops with access to resources can increase knowledge about evidence-based treatment and increase young people's commitment to intervention at the level needed to improve outcomes.",0,0,
752,Evaluation of a complex intervention to change professional behavior: Evidence-Based Access (EBOR) Trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a complex intervention (pharmacists' educational access visits) designed to change general practitioners' prescribing at each step of a hypothetical change pathway that leads to the final primary trial outcome of the change in prescribing. METHOD: The study was conducted at six health authorities in the north of England and six in London. We identified three steps that led to this outcome: 'general practices' who agreed to participate; GPs at each practice participating in the outreach visit by pharmacists; and how GPs' prescribing practices were affected by these visits. The results of each step were evaluated using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Out of 102 randomly selected practices, 75 (73.5%) agreed to participate.Proportion of all physicians attending outreach meeting in small practice (ie 1-2 partners) was 6.7 (95% CI) compared with other practices (ie > 3 partners) : 4.4-23.5).Although pharmacists reported a good relationship in 100 (72%) of the initial visits and accepting management plans in 110 (79%) of these visits, they were confident that they would change the prescription in only 41% of implementation. Pharmacists and general practitioners' satisfaction with social assistance visits from these visits did not lead to drastic changes, and GPs' knowledge of pharmacist-promoted guidelines did not necessarily translate into changes in clinical practice. The main barriers to the implementation of the guidelines set by pharmacists at follow-up visits were organizational difficulties, GPs' skepticism about the evidence available to them, and doctors' disinterest in changing their prescribing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: While our study was limited to an afterthought rather than an advance design, it provides a pragmatic approach to understanding factors influencing the pathway for change in prescribing behavior in response to academic access visits.",0,0,

754,Evaluation of a dental health public health program for old age pensioners in Denmark,"High priority is given to improving the oral health of the elderly in Scandinavia. In 1987 a Danish municipality established a dental health public health program for old age pensioners. All citizens aged 67 were provided with school-based preventive and curative care using guidelines and principles established for children by the Danish Municipal Dental Service. Maintenance was provided free of charge. Citizens who do not wish to receive care through the public system can do so from private dentists. Reimbursement of care received from the private system was provided by the National Health Insurance and the municipality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the program after three years of operation. A follow-up design was used and data were collected through interviews and clinical records. At baseline and at follow-up, 216 (71%) and 235 (77%) retirees were interviewed about their self-evaluation of dental health, dental knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, respectively. Clinical data were collected only for the elderly participating in the public program, and included 194 subjects at baseline and 187 at follow-up. These data included information about tooth loss, dental caries, periodontal health, and the presence and function of removable dentures. At follow-up, 86 percent of all participants made at least one regular visit to the dentist per year, compared to 46 percent at baseline""; 75 percent participated in the public program and 11 percent received care from private practitioners.

DATA SOURCES: DAMET-2 included standard treatment algorithms and training disseminated by computer-assisted and traditional methods associated with remote medicine. Two primary care settings were selected and subjects with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes > or =6 months, > or =18 years of age with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (defined by table review) were eligible for inclusion. For subjects in the experimental group, intermediate practitioners (N = 34) received training in American Diabetes Association treatment algorithms, made phone calls and bimonthly visits with diabetes specialists at 2- to 4-week intervals, and received treatment guidance from remote diabetes within 24 hours. experts. Weekly diabetes clinics were opened to the subjects in the experimental group. After 12 months, the last available subject data were extracted from the subjects' charts and compared with 12-month chart data from a control group (N = 101) who did not receive additional study services. RESULTS: Mean HbA(1c) values decreased by 0.46% from baseline in the active treatment group and by 0.06% in the control group""; however, the reductions in HbA(1c) did not reach statistical significance potentially due to the small sample size of the patients. . experimental group. Mean SBP values were significantly reduced in both groups; however, LDL-C was only significantly reduced in the control group, where more aggressive use of statins could be effective. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Despite inconsistencies in risk factor reduction from the pilot program, the DAMET-2 program provided information on the importance of electronic records and provider notifications, patient compliance, prioritization of provider resources among patients by risk factor level, and access. self-management training.",0,0,

However, barriers remain and they relate to evidence features, organizations and contexts. To address these major knowledge transfer (KT) issues, we need to rethink how knowledge is produced and used, improve our understanding of decision-making processes, their rationale and mechanisms, and examine the ability of public health services to integrate research findings into their own research findings. decisions and transactions. This article presents a realistic evaluation protocol for evaluating a PI scheme in prevention policy and practice at the local level in France. Methods/design This study is a comparative multiple case study using a realistic approach to evaluate a KT plan in regional health institutions (ARS) and regional non-profit organizations for health education and promotion (IREPS). mechanisms/results. The assessed KT scheme was designed for the use of six reviews of systematic reviews on the following themes: nutrition, alcohol, tobacco use, physical activity, emotional and sex life, and psychosocial skills. It combines the following activities: promoting access to and adapting scientific and usable evidence; strengthen the ability of professionals to analyze, adopt and use evidence in their practice and decision-making; facilitating the use of evidence in organizations and processes. RAMESE II reporting standards were used for realistic evaluations. Discussion The objectives of this study were to try and characterize factors related to the plan's ability to enable public health stakeholders to address the challenges of KT and integrate scientific knowledge into policy and practice.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test this short, individualized training program with subordinates to explore its acceptability, feasibility, and impact on physicians' trust, communication skills, attitudes towards psychosocial care, and burnout. DESIGN: The content of the educational intervention was informed by a systematic literature review on end-of-life communication and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The intervention was based on sound educational principles and included three one-hour teaching sessions over a three-week period, including two individual sessions with an expert facilitator and simulated patient/caregiver. In addition, participants were given written and audio-visual take-home learning materials. PARTICIPANTS were video-recorded with a simulated patient/caregiver with pre/post training counseling to evaluate the impact of the course on their communication behaviors. PARTICIPANTS completed pre/post-education unidentified questionnaires, including self-assessed confidence, attitudes towards psychosocial care, and the Maslach Burnout inventory. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS consisted of 22 young doctors from a large teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia.

758,Evaluation of a physician-focused educational intervention for children receiving medical care with asthma.,"BACKGROUND: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 mandated a review of drug use in response to inappropriate drug use. In the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, pediatric asthma is associated with higher healthcare utilization and cost. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a physician-focused education intervention on asthma medication use and healthcare use. METHODS: The pre-intervention and post-intervention comparison design was used in children aged 5-18 years enrolled in the Pennsylvania Medicaid service fee program from July 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999 (pre-intervention) and July 1. From 1999 to 31 March 2000 (post-intervention). The intervention package included patients' medication profiles, medical history, monograph with national asthma management guidelines, and patient education materials provided to physicians. The main outcome measures are changes in asthma medication use among high users of short-acting beta(2)-agonists (SAB). RESULTS: The intervention focused on 2 asthma medication use criteria: (1) high use of responsive medications and (2) use of salmeterol without a curative medication. The intervention reduced the use of rapid-relief drugs by 26% in patients with higher use, without significant changes in long-term control drugs. Additionally, 82% of evaluated recipients showed a positive change in their use of salmeterol due to the addition of a SAB inhaler after the intervention or the discontinuation of salmeterol after the intervention. There were no significant changes in asthma-related emergency room visits or hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: While responding physicians agreed on the usefulness of the educational materials, the results indicate that the intervention had limited success in improving pharmacological management and had no impact on health outcomes. We believe that educational materials mailed to physicians can be effective in changing prescribing behavior"";"" however, a more versatile intervention may be necessary to improve health outcomes.",0,0,

Obesity is a chronic condition that carries a significant health risk. National guidelines for use in the UK on the management of overweight or obese persons have been published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2006). NICE recommendations for primary care teams include: ""determining the extent of overweight and obesity; assessing lifestyle, comorbidities, and willingness to change; offering multi-component management of overweight and obesity; referral to external services where appropriate. implementation of these recommendations by primary care teams."" METHODS/DESIGN: Study is a cluster randomized controlled trial Primary care teams will be recruited from the East Midlands of England and randomized into two study arms: 1) a set of workgroups to assist primary care teams in implementing the NICE guidelines for overweight and obesity special intervention is offered; or 2) control group in which primary care teams continue to administer usual care Primary outcome is proportion of overweight or obese patients whose primary care team complies with NICE guidelines Secondary outcomes are patients with lifestyle assessment enrollment rate, referral to external weight loss services, proportion of obese patients who lost weight during the intervention period, and mean weight change over the same period.

760,Evaluation of a toolkit to improve cardiovascular disease screening and treatment for people with type 2 diabetes: protocol for a cluster-random pragmatic trial.,"BACKGROUND: The difference between the level of care recommended by evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and the actual care given to patients in practice is well established. The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) established an implementation strategy to improve the implementation of the 2008 guidelines. This study will evaluate the impact of a strategy to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening, prevention and treatment in people with diabetes. DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster randomization trial will be conducted to evaluate the CDA's CVD Toolkit. All family physicians in Ontario, Canada were randomly assigned to receive the Toolkit, which includes a variety of printed educational materials targeting CVD screening, prevention and treatment in spring 2009 (intervention arm) or spring 2010 (control arm). Randomization took place at the application level. Forty family physicians from each branch will be assigned to participate and the medical records of 20 diabetes patients at high risk for CVD will be retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes will be evaluated for each patient between July 2009 and March 2010. The primary outcome would be for the patient to take a statin. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) taking an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 2) various interim measurements (A1c, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, body mass index, and waist circumference), and 3) clinical inertia (inability to change therapy in response to an abnormal A1c, blood pressure, or cholesterol reading). The analysis will be performed using multi-level hierarchical logistic regression models to account for the clustered nature of the data. The group assignment will be a doctor-level variable. In addition, a process evaluation study with six focus groups of family physicians will assess the acceptability of the CDA Toolkit and explore the factors that contributed to any change or absence in behavior from the family physicians' perspectives. DISCUSSION: Printed educational materials for physicians have been shown to make small-to-moderate changes in patient care. The CDA's CVD Toolkit is an example of a practice guideline implementation strategy that can be distributed relatively inexpensively to a wide audience, so demonstrating its effectiveness in improving diabetes care could have important implications for guideline developers, policymakers, and clinicians.",0,0,
761,Evaluation of Abnormal Mammography Results and Palpable Breast Abnormalities,"Background: Since approximately 1 in 10 women with a breast mass or an abnormal mammogram result will have breast cancer, a series of decisions must be made by the primary care practitioner to diagnose or exclude breast cancer among these women. The most accurate and least invasive way to evaluate an abnormal mammogram result and a palpable breast abnormality. Data Source: MEDLINE study (January 1966 - March 2003), articles describing the accuracy of clinical examination, biopsy procedures, and radiographic examination for patients with abnormal mammography results or palpable breast abnormalities for reviews. Study Selection: Authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that provided relevant primary data. 1) if mammography, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or core needle biopsy was performed before definitive diagnosis; 2) if the study sample included 100 or more women; and 3) breast cancer status was determined from histopathological examination of excisional biopsy specimens, from a state cancer registry or affiliation with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and Final Results program, or from clinical follow-up of 95% or more of the study sample. Data Extraction: One researcher summarized the results. Methods were evaluated for major potential biases, but methodological scoring was not done. Data Synthesis: Odds ratios for initial screening mammography, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) evaluation category were 0.1 for negative or benign finding and 1.2 for possibly benign finding. findings, 7 need for additional imaging evaluation, 125 suspected abnormalities and 2200 highly suggestive of malignancy. For fine-needle aspiration biopsy of an obvious lump performed by formally trained physicians, the odds ratio was infinite for malignant, 2.6 for atypical/suspect, and 0.02 for benign. When diagnostic mammography was used to evaluate a palpable lump or nonpalpable breast abnormality, the positive odds ratios were 5.6 and 9.4, and the negative odds ratios were 0.15 and 0.19, respectively. Results: Women whose screening mammography results were interpreted with suspicious abnormality or a high risk of breast cancer suggestive of malignancy high and surgical biopsy and core needle biopsy or needle localization should be performed. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as needing additional imaging evaluation have a moderate risk for breast cancer and should undergo diagnostic mammography or ultrasonography to decide whether to biopsy a non-palpable breast lesion. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as possibly benign are at low risk of breast cancer and may have a mammogram 6 months later. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy or ultrasonography is recommended as the initial diagnostic test of palpable breast abnormality to distinguish simple cysts from solid masses. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy also allows for the characterization of a solid mass. Diagnostic mammography does not help determine whether a palpable breast mass should be biopsied and should not affect the decision to perform a biopsy.",0,0,
762,Evaluation of an informative brochure on AIDS/HIV infection for primary care workers in Catalonia,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate primary health care workers' understanding and acceptance of the HIV/AIDS periodic information booklet. DESIGN: Cross. SETTING: Primary care teams from the Institut Catala de la Salut. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 300 doctors, qualified nurses and social workers. INTERVENTION: A self-administered, anonymous survey sent by regular mail. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The questions covered the thematic areas: clinical care of people infected with HIV/AIDS and requests for diagnostic testing for infection, perception of patients' ability to promote changes in sexual behavior and drug use, provision of psychological support, and guidelines and social resources for the integration of HIV+ children in schools information about. 60% knew the broadcast. The thematic areas of greatest interest were: psychological support to affected people, HIV infection prevention in the healthcare setting, clinical advice and diagnosis. 77% received requests for diagnostic tests and 88% joined the infected.

763,Evaluation of an Internet-based decision support system for the implementation of ATS/CDC guidelines for tuberculosis preventive therapy.,"Preventive treatment for tuberculosis (TB) infected patients remains an important component of TB control. The American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) have developed guidelines based on PPD reactivity and pretest infection probability to guide physicians in implementing preventative therapy. Guidelines have become complex and many clinicians have difficulty applying them. The authors developed a computerized decision support system to assist clinicians in applying the ATS/CDC guidelines. Published on the World Wide Web using hypertext markup language, this tool provides patient-specific recommendations based on patient-specific information communicated by the physician. Four local TB specialists derived eight TB infection scenarios and validated the web-based tool, whose effectiveness was tested using general internal medicine assistants, by randomly dividing them into two groups. Group A (n = 12) used the web-based tool and Group B (n = 17) used pre-existing understanding of guidelines and/or written sources to identify the need for preventive treatment in case scenarios. Group A used therapy correctly in 92/96 probable cases (95.8%), Group B only used 77/136 (56.6%) cases (p < 0.001). Group A required an average of three mouse clicks and 1.5 minutes per scenario to reach their selection, and they rated the web-based tool as both intuitive and effective. These data demonstrate that a computer-based decision support system for the implementation of TB treatment guidelines can be delivered over the Internet and provide an efficient and effective resource for clinicians.",0,1,

Interventions: Patients were randomized to a computer-based clinical decision support system plus cardiovascular risk table""; cardiovascular risk table only;"" or normal maintenance. Main outcome measures: Percentage of patients with five-year cardiovascular risk in each group = 10%, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular drug prescription. Conclusions: Patients in the computer-based clinical decision support system and chart-only groups were no more likely to have a cardiovascular risk reduction below 10% than patients who received normal care. Patients in the computer-based clinical decision support group were 10% more likely to have cardiovascular risk than patients in the chart alone, with an odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.8). The chart-only group had significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the usual care group (mean difference -4.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -8.4 to -0.8). Diastolic blood pressure reduction did not differ between the three groups. Two times more likely to be prescribed two classes of cardiovascular drugs and three times more likely to be prescribed three or more classes of drugs compared to results: Computer-based clinical decision support system did not provide any benefit in absolute risk reduction or blood pressure control and before use in clinical care The use of table guidelines is associated with a potentially significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.",1,1,
765,Evaluation of internet-based clinical decision support systems.,"Background: Science-based clinical guidelines are increasingly being used to educate physicians and improve quality of care. While individual guidelines are potentially helpful, repeated studies have shown that guidelines are ineffective in changing physician behavior. The Internet has evolved as a potentially useful tool for guideline education, dissemination and implementation because of its open standards and ability to provide concise, relevant clinical information where and when needed. Purpose: Our aim was to develop and test decision support systems (DSS) based on clinical guidelines available online for two disease models: asthma and tuberculosis (TB) preventive treatment. Methods: Using open HTML and CGI standards, we developed an acute asthma severity assessment DSS and a preventive tuberculosis treatment DSS based on the content of national guidelines accepted as standards of care. Both KDSs are posted on the Internet and work through a decision algorithm developed from parental guidelines with user-provided clinical information at the clinical point of care. We tested the effectiveness of each DSS in influencing physician decisions using clinical scenario tests. Results: We first validated the asthma algorithm by comparing asthma specialists' decisions with non-pulmonary nurses' decisions using computerized DDS. Nurses using the DSS scored the same as the specialists (88% vs 89%""; p = NS). Next, using the same scenario testing tool, we compared internists using the DSS with residents using a printed version of the National Asthma. Curriculum-2 guidelines Residents using computerized DSS scored significantly better than residents using paper-based guides (84% vs. 92%; p <0.002) Similarly, we compared residents using computerized TB DSS with residents using a printed reference Residents using computerized DSS scored significantly better (95.8% vs. 56.6% correct; ""p<0.001). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that guidelines disseminated through traditional educational interventions have minimal impact on physician behavior. Although computerized DDS is effective in changing physician behavior, most of these systems are not widely available. We developed two clinical DSS based on national guidelines and published them online. Both systems improved physician compliance with national guidelines when tested in clinical scenarios. By providing information linked to the relevant activity, we expect these widely available DSSs to serve as effective educational tools to positively influence physician behavior.",0,1,
766,Evaluation of studies investigating the effectiveness of pharmacists' clinical services,"quantitative evaluation of randomized trials of counseling, education, and other clinical services provided by pharmacists was performed. Data sources are MEDLINE and bibliographies of published articles. Pharmacy services are categorized as patient counseling, physician counseling, both patient and physician counseling, and patient care. The conclusions drawn are measures of patient behavior, disease, symptoms, and patient knowledge. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Pharmacists were identified as clinical pharmacists in 24 studies and community pharmacists in 2 studies. In six non-blind patient counseling studies, outcomes favored counselor patients over control patients in each study, and the effects were statistically significant in five studies (the result was medication adherence in these five studies). In the seven counseling trials for both patients and their physicians, patient outcomes were significantly better in the intervention group in six trials, four of which were single-blind. Two studies in which patients were randomized to either physician counseling or control groups yielded inconsistent results. In a study in which doctors were randomized to seek counseling from pharmacists, prescriptions in the counseling group were more likely to follow guidelines than in the control group. Four patient care attempts by pharmacists were unsuccessful. These trials have shown that counseling by pharmacists of patients and their physicians can improve patient outcomes. The evidence that counseling patients alone improves patient outcomes was good, though weak due to poor trial design.",0,0,

Schools, family smoking education project (FSE)"", cigarette and me project (SAM); both projects in turn (FSE/SAM);"" or no interference. ADJUST 39 schools in Wales and England matched in size and service area profile. SUBJECTS All first-year students in schools were included and assessed in three situations (4538 before instruction (1988), 3930 immediately after instruction (1989), 3786 (1990) at one-year follow-up). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported smoking behavior (supported by saliva sample) and change in related health knowledge, beliefs, and values. RESULTS There were no consistent and significant differences in smoking behavior, health knowledge, beliefs, or values between the four groups. For baseline never-smokers, the rate of never-smoker in 1990 was 74% (594/804) in the control group, 65% (455/704) in the FSE group, 70% (440/625) in the SAM group, and 69% in the FSE/SAM group ( 549/791) (chi 2adj = 6.1, df = 3, p = 0.1). Knowledge of the effects of smoking increased from an average score of 5.4 in 1988 for all groups to 6.4 in 1989 and 6.5 in 1990. CONCLUSIONS More comprehensive interventions than school health education alone will be needed to reduce youth smoking. Other measures need to be considered, including additional restrictions on access to cigarettes and the promotion of tobacco products. More research will be needed to develop effective school-based health education projects that normally need to be formally field-tested before they can become widespread.",0,0,

A systematic review of available published evidence is required to identify interventions that lead to improvements in behavior, health, and well-being. Authoritative literature reviews depend on the quality of published research and research reports. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement (www.consort-statement.org) was developed to improve the design and reporting of interventions involving randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in medical journals. We describe 22 CONSORT guidelines and describe their application to behavioral medicine research and evidence-based practice. Additional behavioral medicine-specific guidelines (eg, adherence to treatment) are also provided. Use of these guidelines by clinicians, educators, policymakers, and researchers who design, report, and evaluate or review RCTs will strengthen research itself and accelerate efforts to apply behavioral medicine research to improve the processes and outcomes of behavioral medicine practice.",0,0,

Evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of people with dementia in general practice"";"" however, detection, diagnosis, and disclosure of dementia have been identified as potential evidence-to-practice gaps. Interventions to put the guidelines into practice have had varying success. The use of theory in designing practice interventions is limited, but is advocated for its potential to provide more effective interventions and to help understand factors that change the magnitude of intervention effects across trials. This protocol describes the methods of a randomized trial testing a theory-based practice intervention that, if effective, could provide benefits for patients with dementia and their caregivers. OBJECTIVES: This trial aims to estimate the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase GPs' adherence to a clinical guideline for the detection, diagnosis and management of dementia in general practice, compared to providing GPs with a medical aid. hard copy of the manual. Primary goals include testing whether the intervention is effective in increasing the percentage of patients with suspected cognitive impairment who receive care consistent with two key guidelines recommendations: ai) obtaining a formal cognitive assessment, and ii) assessing depression using a validated scale (primary outcomes Trial). METHODS: The design is a parallel set randomized trial in which sets are common applications. We aim to get 60 apps per group. Applications will be randomly allocated to intervention and control groups using restricted randomization. Detection and diagnostic behavior towards patients and GPs who meet the inclusion criteria will be determined and measured through electronic searches of medical records nine months after the start of the intervention. Practitioners in the control group will receive a hard copy of the manual. In addition to obtaining the printed manual, practitioners in the intervention group will be invited to participate in an interactive, opinion leader-led, educational face-to-face workshop. The theory-based intervention aims to address identified barriers and facilitators to the implementation of recommendations. Investigators responsible for identifying the group of patients suspected of having cognitive impairment and their detection and diagnostic results will be blinded to the group distribution.

The third version is clearly based on available evidence and, like previous Clinical Practice Guidelines, is offered as advice for practitioners to aid clinical decision-making: it can also serve as an information resource for patients and caregivers and aid management. Recommendations are accompanied by a more detailed review of the relevant evidence. A consensus meeting of experts on bipolar disorder and its treatment reviewed key areas and evaluated the strength of the evidence and clinical implications.

A mailed questionnaire included questions about GPs demographics and practice characteristics""; awareness about CPA; sources of information about migraine and CPA;"" and the patient's treatment behavior. Only 27.2% of GPs agreed that clinical trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, and this awareness was higher in those who learned about migraine from scientific journals or continuing education courses and those who attended CPA courses. For two-thirds of GPs, disability is equivalent to disease diagnosis, and this behavior was more prevalent in those who agreed that clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive or curative treatments for migraine and that the clinical approach to migraine requires an evaluation. Clinical efficacy is in those who treat fewer headache patients, older people, and those who do not use guidelines. The majority of GPs (93.1%) said it was important to integrate the best available evidence with clinical practice, and this behavior was significantly more frequent in those who agreed that the clinical approach to migraine required a clinical assessment of efficacy and the clinical trials were adequate. It is necessary for evaluating the effectiveness of preventive or curative treatments for migraine and for those attending courses on CPA.

775,Evidence-based medicine and women: Do the principles and practice of CPA improve women's health?,"Clinicians and policy makers around the world are embracing evidence-based medicine (CPA). The CPA's promise is to use summaries of research evidence to identify which health interventions are effective and which are not so that patients can benefit from effective interventions and be protected from those that are useless or harmful. The CPA provides a seemingly rational objective tool for deciding whether to provide an intervention on the basis of its effectiveness, which in theory leads to fair and effective health care for all. In this article, I take a closer look at these claims from a health care perspective for women, using relevant examples. I would argue that the current processes of evidence-based medicine contain some prejudice against women. These biases arise in the production of research that informs evidence-based medicine, in the methods used to analyze and synthesize evidence, and in the practice of CPA through the use of guidelines. Finally, the biomedical health model that underlies much of the medical research used by the CPA ignores the social and political context that contributes so much to women's health.",0,0,
776,Evidence-based medicine. Interpreting studies and setting policy,"The rise of the CPA has been accompanied by a greater awareness of its shortcomings. From the cost, length, and difficulty of performing RCTs, it is becoming increasingly apparent that studies cannot be initiated to address every question in medicine. Good evidence is often lacking in medicine. Epistomologists question the concepts of evidence and the relevance of current study designs and measurement tools to investigate salient issues of interest to patients and others regarding quality. Lack of evidence of effectiveness does not prove ineffectiveness, but in response to CPA, insurers and government often make this inference to justify their decision to withhold coverage or research support. Unbridled enthusiasm for the evidence-based practice guideline in the early 1990s was tempered by a more mature understanding of its limitations. Many practice guidelines are not well developed, and applying incorrect guidelines can cause harm. The seven-step process outlined earlier is slow, laborious, and expensive (sometimes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars). Furthermore, there is little evidence that the rigor of the methods or the guidelines themselves have a significant impact on administration behavior or patient outcomes. According to the most cynical observers, the only consistent beneficiaries of guides are payers who have used them with significant success in reducing costs, length of stay and usage rates. Even ardent proponents of the guidelines acknowledge the evidence that disseminating reviews and recommendations alone fails to motivate clinicians to increase the delivery of effective interventions and abandon ineffective ones. This lack of response has spurred a closer look at the barriers to behavior change and the design of thoughtful implementation strategies that begin with simple guidelines but go beyond. Tools such as reminder systems, fixed orders, academic elaboration, peer review and supervision, feedback, and health system changes recognize that knowing what needs to be done is only one piece of an increasingly complex puzzle. The competitive market for managed healthcare has added new economic effects on clinician behavior, but it is also fueling private sector interest in good research.

In 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published an opinion statement aimed at guiding obstetricians in responding to such patients. In this article, I examine the ACOG statement in light of the historical and contemporary clinical realities surrounding home birth in the United States, guided by my own experience as an obstetrician in home birth and non-home birth friendly births. medical environment. Comparison with other guidelines shows that the ACOG treats home birth as an ethical exception: comparable evidence leads to dramatically different recommendations in the case of home birth and in the case of a previous attempted cesarean delivery""; and ACOG quite diverges other controversial issues involving similar ethical questions. By making information provision not only the primary but also the sole ethical responsibility of the obstetrician, the ACOG statement removes the obstetrician's responsibility to provide appropriate clinical care and to create the safest clinical environment possible for mothers who choose home birth and their newborns. What at first glance appears to be an expression of respect for women's autonomy implicitly allows behavior that unethically limits truly autonomous choices. There is no need for obstetricians to participate in home births, I think. However, our ethical duties make us (1) talented cl.

780,"Exercise advice: public health panacea for the promotion of physical activity? A critical perspective on exercise referral schemes"";"" their development and evaluation","This review critically explores the development, impact and evaluation of exercise referral plans (ERS) in the UK. There has been rapid expansion in the use of such ERS in leisure and primary care settings, but evidence to support their application is scarce and is predominantly limited to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) research design. As a result, understanding of exercise orientation as a 'real world' intervention has been limited. Given the increasing emphasis on evidence-based practice and clinical effectiveness, it is no longer enough for exercise referral service providers to ignore the need to evaluate programs. Guidelines for assessment provided by the National Quality Assurance Framework for Exercise Guidance are limited, so practitioners are often unsure of the best measures to use when assessing efficacy. Predominantly, exercise professionals focus on collecting physiological data but tend to ignore relevant psychological and environmental parameters. Also, there is very little UK research that follows participants over the long term to see if physical activity behavior is maintained over time. Here we describe the evidence from two ongoing large-scale (n = 1600/year) evaluation studies of exercise referral plans based in urban settlements in the northwest of England. A participatory action research framework was used for evaluation and combined multi-method research approaches for the evaluation of both ERS participants and healthcare professionals involved in intervention delivery. This framework is a suitable methodology for evaluating and developing complex interventions and includes case study, focus groups, interviews and survey questionnaires. A 12-month follow-up study of a cohort of exercise referral participants (n = 342) measuring leisure physical activity levels (Godin leisure score) at baseline (entry to exercise referral) and then at 3-month intervals was included. . Adherence to the ERS was approximately 35-45%, and older participants were more likely to complete it. Physiological changes during ERS, although statistically significant, were not large enough to convey any real health benefits to the individual's health status. Although small in scale, the physiological changes were all positive (for example, reduction in blood pressure) and, if sustained over time, could yield population-level benefits in health. Participants referred from cardiac and practice nurses had higher levels of compliance than participants referred by general practitioners. Scheme B showed that participants who adhered until the end of the ERS (12 weeks) (n = 103) were able to maintain a small increase in physical activity after 12 months (compared to 21 minutes of moderate activity/week increase). basis).

However, who will be tested and how often is debatable. Purpose: To inform the design of HIV screening programs where screening is cost-effective by determining the combination of screening frequency and HIV prevalence and incidence. Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis linking simulation models of HIV screening to published reports of HIV transmission risk, with or without antiretroviral therapy. Data Sources: Published randomized trials, observational cohorts, national cost and service use surveys, Red Book, and previous modeling results. Target Population: US populations with low to moderate HIV prevalence (0.05 to 1.0%) and annual incidence (0.0084 to 0.12%). Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Social. Interventions: One-time and increasingly frequent voluntary HIV screening of all adults using same-day rapid testing. Outcomes: HIV infections detected, secondary transmissions avoided, quality-adjusted survival, lifetime medical costs, and community cost-effectiveness reported as discounted 2004 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results of the Baseline Analysis: Routine HIV screening in a population of 1.0% HIV prevalence and 0.12% annual incidence, increased cost-effectiveness rates 30 800 $/QALY, under moderately favorable assumptions about the impact of HIV patient care on secondary transmission. one-time scan), $32300/QALY (scan every 5 years), and $55500/QALY (scan every 3 years). In settings with an HIV prevalence of 0.10% and an annual incidence of 0.014%, one-time screening produced cost-effectiveness rates of $60,700/QALY. Results of the Sensitivity Analysis: The cost-effectiveness of screening policies varied within a narrow range, as assumptions about the impact of screening on secondary transmission changed from positive to negative. Assuming moderate positive effects of antiretroviral therapy on transmission, cost-effectiveness rates have remained below $50,000/QALY for routine one-time HIV screening in settings where HIV prevalence is as low as 0.20% and prevalences are low at 0.45% annually. The incidence for screening every 5 years is as low as 0.0075%. Limitations: This analysis does not address the difficulty of determining the prevalence and incidence of undetected HIV infection in a given patient population. Conclusions: Routine, rapid HIV testing is recommended for all adults except in settings where there is evidence of an undiagnosed prevalence of HIV infection below 0.2%.",0,0,

Accordingly, patients should move towards constant pain and suffering and come to the stage of last resort before the option to pursue CSD is considered. Alternatively, we present and advocate new guidance in which terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of less than six months, with decision-making abilities, can request a CSD before suffering the resistant suffering of ""last resort"" treatment.",0,0,
783,Experience-based design: From redesigning the system around the patient to designing services with the patient,"Engaging patients in the service improvement process and listening to and responding to what they have to say has played an important role in redesigning healthcare over the past five years or more. Patients and users have participated in stakeholder events, participated in exploratory talks, completed surveys, mapped healthcare processes, and even designed new hospitals with healthcare staff. However, efforts to date have not necessarily focused on the patient's experience, beyond asking what is good and what is bad. Questions were not asked to learn the details of what the experience was or should be like (""experience"" differs from ""attitudes""), and the information was then used systematically to design services with patients. Only the patient's knowledge of experience is unique and valuable. In this article, attention is drawn to the developing discipline of design sciences and experiential design, where the traditional view that sees the user as a passive buyer of a product or service has begun to give way to the new user view. It is an integral part of the improvement and innovation process.",0,0,
784,Decision-Analysis Recommendations Against Expert Panel for Post-Discharge Coronary Angiography After Myocardial Infarction,"Context Expert panels and decision analysis techniques are increasingly used to determine the appropriateness of medical interventions, but these 2 approaches use different methods to process evidence. Purpose To compare expert panel suitability ratings of coronary angiography after myocardial infarction (from hospital discharge to 12 weeks post-infarction) with the health gains and cost-effectiveness predicted by a decision-analytic model. Design Comparison of the significance of clinical variables considered in expert panel fit ratings compared to a previously published decision-analytic model. Identification of 36 clinical scenarios from the expert panel that can be simulated by the decision-analytic model. Key Outcome Measures Relevance score and fitness stratification (expert panel) and earnings in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and increased cost-effectiveness ratio (decision-analytical model). Results The most important clinical variables were similar across the 2 approaches, and the exercise tolerance test result exerted the greatest leverage on the strength of recommendation for angiography. Among the expert panel clinical scenarios considered appropriate for coronary angiography that could be simulated in the decision analysis model, the median (interquartile range) health gain and incremental cost-effectiveness rate were 0.59 (0.41-0.76) QALY and $27,000 ($23,000). . -$35,000 per QALY earned, respectively). Among the clinical scenarios that expert panels considered inappropriate, the corresponding medians (interquartile ranges) were 0.24 (0.19-0.34) QALYs and $54,000 ($36,000-58,000) per QALY earned. The Spearman rank correlation between fitness score and QALY attainment was 0.58 (P<.001), and the correlation between fitness score and estimated incremental cost-effectiveness rates was ?0.66 (P<.001). Results For the 36 expert panel scenarios that could be simulated by the decision-analytic model, there was moderate to good agreement between both the health gain and the increased cost-effectiveness ratio and fitness score of coronary angiography compared to no angiography during convalescence. Stage of acute myocardial infarction, but several scenarios assessed as inappropriate by the expert panel approach had cost-effectiveness rates comparable to many recommended medical interventions overall. A formal synthesis of expert judgment and decision modeling is warranted in future guideline development efforts.",0,0,
785,Explaining the effects of two different strategies for promoting hand hygiene in hospital nurses: a process evaluation combined with a cluster of randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: There is only limited understanding of why hand hygiene improvement strategies have succeeded or failed. It is therefore important to look inside the 'black box' of such strategies to determine which components of a strategy work well or less well. This study examined which components of the two hand hygiene improvement strategies were associated with increased hand hygiene compliance by nurses. METHODS: A process evaluation of a cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which a portion of the nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands received a cutting-edge strategy including training, reminders, feedback and optimizing materials and facilities. ;"" another section received a team and leaders-led strategy that included all elements of a state-of-the-art strategy, supported by activities aimed at strengthening social and leadership. Four sets of measures were used in this process assessment: effects on nurses' hand hygiene compliance, adherence to improvement strategies, contextual factors and nurses' experience with strategy components.Analyses of variance and multiple regression analyzes were used to investigate changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance and thus to better understand trial effects. RESULTS: Both strategies were applied with good adherence to the protocol. Two contextual factors with changes in hand hygiene compliance was associated: a long-term hospital effect (p < 0.05) and higher hand hygiene baseline scores were associated with smaller effects (p < 0.01). i was positively associated with reports (p < 0.05). In the long run, several elements of the components of 'social influence' (ie, addressing each other about undesirable hand hygiene behavior p < 0.01) and 'leadership' (ie, ward manager holds team members responsible for hand hygiene performance p < 0.01)) in nurses' hand hygiene compliance showed a positive correlation with the changes. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the use of a process assessment to reveal the mechanisms underlying change in hand hygiene improvement strategies. Our study results demonstrate the added value of certain aspects of social influence and leadership in hand hygiene improvement strategies, thus providing an interpretation of the trial effects.

786,Explaining variation in GP referral rates for x-ray for back pain,"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of clinical guidelines for the treatment of low back pain (LBP), there remains large variation in referral rates by general practitioners (GPs) for lumbar spine x-ray (LSX). This study aims to explain the differences in referral rates for LSX from general practitioners' explanations of the management of patients with low back pain. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 29 GPs in North East England with high and low referral rates for LSX. Thematic analysis used continuous comparative techniques. RESULTS: Common and different themes were identified between high and low LSX users. Themes that were similar in both groups included awareness of current guidelines for the use of LSX in patients with LBP and pressure from patients and institutional factors to order an LSX. Differentiating themes for the high user group included: a belief that LSX provides patients with greater reassurance than risks, pessimism about management options for LBP, and a belief that rejecting LSX will negatively impact doctor-patient relationships. Two specific distinguishing themes are covered in greater depth: GPs' awareness of their relative use of lumbar spine radiology and the perceived risks associated with LSX radiation. CONCLUSION: Despite being aware of clinical guideline recommendations, there are several key factors that differentiate GPs' accounts of high and low referral rates for LSX. Intervention efforts aimed at improving compliance with guideline recommendations on LSX use by changing primary care practitioners' ranking behavior should focus on these factors.",0,0,
787,Explain the differences in prescribing costs across the UK,"OBJECTIVE To derive a predictive model for national prescribing behavior in terms of key morbidity and demographic factors. DESIGN 24 demographic, morbidity, and practice factors were entered in multiple regression analysis to determine the net cost of content per patient. IDENTIFY 90 UK family health service officials for 1989. CONCLUSIONS Only two demographic factors (number of retirees and mobility of the registered population as measured by list inflation) and two disease-related factors (standardized death rates and numbers) for net content cost per patient contributed significantly to the multiple regression model. This model explains 81% of the variation in the cost of net content per registered patient among family health care authorities. The model also provided the derivation of a weighting factor of 4.6 (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 6.7) for the net content cost for elderly patients (compared to the current prescribing unit factor 3). CONCLUSIONS The model shows that changes in prescribing costs mainly reflect demand. He also argues that the current prescribing unit value of 3 for patients aged 65 and over underestimates the extra costs of prescribing for older patients.",0,0,
788,Descriptive analysis of patients' motivation to quit smoking and attend smoking cessation classes,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Significant research has evaluated the effects of smoking, the effects of exposure to secondhand smoke, the effectiveness of various social and individual interventions for smoking cessation, and the frequency with which physicians discuss smoking cessation with their patients. Few studies have addressed the barriers to physician-initiated discussion and intervention regarding smoking cessation, particularly with resident physicians treating low-income patients. Current research shows that physicians have low expectations of patients' willingness to quit, and often wait to discuss quitting with patients until the patient raises the issue. The aim of this pilot study was to determine smoking trends, willingness to quit smoking, and willingness to attend smoking cessation classes in the family medicine clinic. METHODS: The patients filled out a questionnaire revealing their demographic information, smoking behavior, presence of chronic disease, desire to quit smoking, and reasons for wanting to quit smoking. RESULTS: Higher smoking rates and lower desired quit rates were determined. However, among patients considering quitting smoking, the number of desired cessation classes is relatively high. A higher number of failed quit attempts heralded an increased likelihood of both wanting to quit and requesting dropout classes. Other determinants of completion desire and classroom participation are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current research, physicians are encouraged to follow practice guidelines, ask all patients about their smoking behavior, and assist in their efforts to quit, particularly those who have failed in the past.",0,0,
789,Exploring the boundary-setting perspectives of nurses and patients in the forensic mental health setting,"Limit setting is an intervention frequently used by mental health nurses. However, boundary setting is poorly conceptualized, its purpose is unclear, and there are few evidence-based guidelines to help nurses set boundaries safely and effectively. What is known is that the way nurses set boundaries affects patients' perceptions of interactions and their emotional and behavioral responses. In this qualitative study, 12 nurses and 12 patients participated in personal, semi-structured interviews aimed at exploring demarcation and suggesting principles to guide practice. The findings showed that (i) demarcation is important for safety in mental health hospitals""; (ii) it is necessary to empathically involve patients when setting boundaries (when nurses are empathetically engaged, the therapeutic relationship is more likely to be protected and respond aggressively). risk should be reduced);"" and (iii) an authoritarian (fair, respectful, consistent, and knowledgeable), restraining style rather than authoritarian (supervisory and indifferent) promotes positive outcomes related to commitment, reduced likelihood of aggression, and maintenance of the therapeutic relationship. As a result, an authoritarian style is recommended rather than a restraining style characterized by empathetic responsiveness and an authoritarian interpersonal style. Illuminating the components of this style is critical for the effective training and best practices of mental health nurses and for reducing the aggressive responses that result from boundary-setting.",0,0,
790,Exploring the feasibility of Conjoint Analysis as a tool to prioritize innovations for practice,"Background In an age of scarce and competing priorities for implementation, choosing what to implement is a key decision point for many behavior change projects. The values and attitudes of the professionals and managers involved inevitably influence the priority given to decision options. Such values are difficult to capture reliably. Methods This article presents an approach for capturing and incorporating professional values in the prioritization of healthcare innovations under consideration. The Combined Analysis (CA) was used to measure the priorities of healthcare professionals working with women with postpartum depression at the UK Foundation for Primary Care. Rating-based CA data were collected using a questionnaire and then matched to 12 interventions considered as a way to improve the management of postpartum depression. Results Â¡Â®impact on patient careÂ¡Â¯ and Â¡Â®supporting quality of evidenceÂ¡Â¯ associated with potential innovationsÂ¡Â¯ were most influential in shaping priorities. Professionals were least impressed whether an innovation was a current national or local priority or whether current practice at the Trust met minimum standards. Sorting the 12 innovations by potential adopters' preferences revealed that Â¡Â®guided self-helpÂ¡Â¯ had the highest priority for implementation, and Â¡Â®screening questions¡Â¯ the least for postpartum depression. Given other factors (such as the availability of routine data or planned implementation activity elsewhere in the Trust), the project team chose to combine eight related treatments and apply them as a single innovation called Â¡Â®psychological therapiesÂ¡. A. Conclusions Using Unified Analysis to prioritize potential innovation implementation options is a viable way to capture stakeholder benefit and thereby increase the chances of an innovation being adopted. There are some practical hurdles to overcome, such as increased response rates to composite questionnaires, before the routine and unevaluated use of this technique.",0,1,
791,Exploring the gap between knowledge and behavior: a qualitative study of clinician action following an educational intervention.,"OBJECTIVE: Many medical education interventions improve clinicians' knowledge but fail to change behavior. The authors uncovered this knowledge-behavior gap through standard clinical interactions, thus allowing in-depth investigation of contributing factors. METHODS: In 2001-02, a typical evidence-based educational intervention was administered to family medicine residents in a clinical setting (early signs of autism) at the University of Toronto and change in knowledge was assessed with a multiple-choice test. After six to eight weeks, participants' relevant knowledge was documented and their clinical behavior was observed during four interactions with standardized patients. Factors causing knowledge-behavior mismatch were investigated using semi-structured interviews, which were then audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using grounded theory methods. RESULTS: Half of the participants showed varying degrees of knowledge-behavior gap. Eight major rationalizations (relationships, patient agenda, lack of knowledge, clinical style, means to ends, ideals, autism stigma, and system barriers) were used to justify clinical behavior choices, and the same rationalizations were used to justify opposing behavior choices. . Two conditions (level of certainty and sense of urgency) were identified that encouraged informed clinical action. CONCLUSION: The knowledge-behavior gap was uncovered and the factors reported to influence clinicians' decisions about whether or not to apply new knowledge were revealed. The fact that the same rationalizations have been used to justify opposite behaviors means that these factors may not be behavioral determinants. A sense of urgency and a level of certainty encourage informed clinical action"";"" focusing on these can increase the impact of training on practice.",0,0,
792,Investigating the roots of undesirable security threats associated with the introduction of hospital e-prescribing systems and candidate avoidance and/or mitigation strategies: a qualitative study,"Purpose Hospital electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) systems offer a wide range of patient safety benefits. However, like other hospital health information technology interventions, they can bring new risk areas. Despite recent progress in identifying these risks, the development and use of e-prescribing systems still leads to numerous undesirable consequences that can undermine improvement and threaten patient safety. These negative consequences need to be analyzed in the design, implementation and use of these systems. Therefore, we aimed to understand the roots of these reported threats and to identify candidate avoidance/mitigation strategies. Methods We analyzed a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation and adoption of e-prescribing systems in six UK hospitals, each conceptualized as a case study. The data included semi-structured interviews, observations of practice meetings and system usage, and a collection of related documents. We analyzed the data first within the case studies and then across the case studies. Results Our dataset included 214 interviews, 24 observations, and 18 documents. We developed a classification of factors underlying undesirable security threats: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex drug delivery regimens, lack of effective integration between disparate systems, and lack of effective automated decision support tools; (2) improper use of systems – particularly too much reliance on the system and the introduction of workarounds;"" and (3) suboptimal implementation strategies resulting from partial deployments/binary systems and lack of proper training. A set of systems and organizational strategies that can potentially prevent or mitigate these risks Conclusions Defects in the design, implementation, and use of e-prescribing systems can have unintended consequences, including security threats Hospitals and suppliers should implement short- and long-term strategies in terms of technology and organization to minimize undesirable security risks.",0,0,
793,"External validity of randomized controlled trials: ""To whom do the results of this trial apply?""","Physicians and patients should consider relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews when making treatment decisions. Relevance depends on external validity (or generalizability) – that is, whether the results can reasonably be applied to an identifiable group of patients in routine practice in a given clinical setting. There is concern among clinicians that external validity is often weak, particularly for some pharmaceutical industry trials; this is a perception that leads to the underutilization of effective treatments. Yet researchers, funding agencies, ethics committees, the pharmaceutical industry, medical journals, and government regulators alike ignore external validity, leaving clinicians to judge. However, reporting determinants of external validity in research publications and systematic reviews is often insufficient. This review discusses these determinants, provides a checklist for clinicians, and makes recommendations for greater consideration of external validity in the design and reporting of RCTs.",0,0,

795,Factor Studies: Using Vignettes to Examine Professional Judgment.,"Decision-making is becoming an increasingly central feature of social work practice, but there is limited research on the subject. While questions of validity and generalizability surround ethnographic and other descriptive methods, empirical methods of investigating decision making tend to be constrained by practical and ethical challenges. Here it is discussed that the factorial questionnaire addresses these methodological challenges as a research design to examine the way professionals make decisions in real life. In this research design, lifelike vignettes (case scenarios or paper cases) are presented to social workers or other staff members to make a judgment about a familiar type of scenario. The random factors in the vignettes, combined with the randomization of the vignette selection for each decision maker, gives the factorial survey a unique ability to investigate the influence of multiple factors in complex decisions, unlike the more common factorial experiment. The method is explained and the prospects and issues for the development of this research design to examine professional judgment in social work are discussed. The factorial questionnaire has potential as a method for rigorously examining the impact of client, family, and context factors on decisions made by social work and social care personnel.

796,Factors affecting the feasibility and acceptability of a practice-based educational intervention to support evidence-based prescribing: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Improper and costly GP prescription is a major problem facing Primary Care Trusts. Educational access to practices, along with other measures such as supervision and feedback, has the potential to make GP prescribing more evidence-based. High GP prescribing costs are associated with GPs seeing pharmaceutical company representatives""; tend to end consultations with a prescription;"" and 'try' new drugs on an 'ad hoc basis' and use this as proof of the drug's effect. To meet these and other educational needs, an educational intervention called 'reflective practice' has been developed. The design of the intervention was informed by studies that identified the prerequisites for successful behavior change in general practice. OBJECTIVES: The study investigated: (i) Is it possible for GPs to attend sessions included in the educational intervention? (ii) Is the intervention acceptable to the participants and session facilitators? (iii) What are the barriers to group training processes and how can they be overcome? METHODS: Four practices were recruited in South West England, all experiencing issues with prescribing eligibility and cost. In each of these practices, reflective practice sessions (including a videotaped scenario) were conducted and qualitative methods were used to explore the complex attitudes and behaviors of the participants. In each application, a researcher observed and recorded the sessions. At the end of the program, an example of a doctor and all the facilitators were interviewed about their experience. Recorded data were transcribed and analyzed using standard qualitative methods. RESULTS: Doctors in the largest partnerships had the most difficulty attending sessions. Elsewhere, physicians were also reluctant to get involved because of previous experience with top-down managerial interventions in prescribing quality. The facilitators came from a wide variety of professional backgrounds. While knowledge of prescription drug management issues was important, the facilitator's professional background was less important than group facilitation skills in establishing a group process that the participating GPs found satisfactory. The video-recorded scenario was found useful to set the stage for discussion. Preserving the anonymity of the GPs' responses in the early stages of the sessions was important to ensure honesty in the discussion. It was sometimes difficult to reach a consensus on the management of general conditions, partly because the use of the term 'best buy' denoted economic pressures rather than benefits to patients, and partly because GPs valued the concept of clinical autonomy. 'Reflective Practice' proved to have the potential to inform GPs of the link to be made between clinical management decisions and the evidence provided by the British National Formulary and Clinical Evidence. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the importance of adequately preparing practice, including providing protected time for all GPs to participate in the educational intervention. The scenarios and structure of the sessions should make the links between daily practice and published evidence of effectiveness clearer. The emphasis on cost effectiveness may be counterproductive and the broader benefits need to be emphasized. We also identified the skill profile of the facilitator role. Our study demonstrates the need for a clearer understanding of GPs' perception of clinical autonomy and how this conflicts with the goal of agreeing on practice guidelines for treatment. The intervention is now ripe for further development, perhaps by integrating it with other interventions to change professional behavior. Improved intervention should then be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,
797,Factors associated with nursing interventions to reduce incontinence in hospitalized older adults,"INTRODUCTION: The problem of incontinence in hospitalized elderly patients is rarely documented and there is little research on why nurses choose to help or not help this problem. Are the attitudes and beliefs of acute care nurses about incontinence related to the perceived opportunity to help the patient with the problem? What do hospital nurses know about causes and interventions for incontinence? METHODS: Two vignettes were created, one describing a patient with stress incontinence and the other with urge incontinence. Questions measuring the variables of the helping model were developed and nurses were asked to mark each question on a Likert-type scale while answering them. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty participants returned completed questionnaires, along with three nurse specialists. Many hospital nurses believed that incontinence was temporary and part of aging. As a group, they had a more positive attitude towards intervention for urge incontinence and believed that physician and nurse managers expected them to help the patient with urge incontinence. Respondents tended to believe that the patient was least likely to seek help. Participants were equally divided on the opportunity to provide help for stress or urge incontinence. Less than half of the nurses correctly listed the causes and interventions for stress or urge incontinence. CONCLUSION: Lack of knowledge about other clinical problems perceived as more urgent and appropriate help measures affect nurses' perceptions of the opportunity to intervene when elderly patients in the hospital have incontinence. Evaluation and intervention are essential for quality nursing care. Undergraduate nursing education and ongoing staff training on incontinence are essential for assessments and interventions to be accurate. As healthcare consumers, patients should be more educated about incontinence and choose to have the problem addressed during hospitalization. The Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research Clinical Practice Guidelines is an important recommended reference.",0,0,
798,Factors Associated with Poor Mental Health of Guatemalan Refugees Living in Mexico 20 Years After the Civil Conflict,"Context From 1981 to 2001, 46,000 refugees in Chiapas, Mexico, fleeing 36 years of internal conflict in Guatemala, were under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of mental illness and factors associated with poor mental health in underserved Guatemalan refugee communities in Chiapas, Mexico since 1981, and to assess the need for mental health services. Design, Environment and Participants Cross-sectional survey of 183 households representing approximately 1546 residents (adults and children) in 5 Maya refugee camps in Chiapas, November-December 2000. Main Outcome Measures Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety symptom criteria, and depression as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (Hopkins-25). Results One adult (age = 16 years old) per household (n=170 participants) who agreed to participate in the analysis was included and represents an estimated 93% of households. All participants reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event, with an average of 8.3 traumatic events per person. Twenty (11.8%) of the respondents had all symptom criteria for PTSD.

799,Failure of computerized therapy recommendations to improve health outcomes in outpatients with uncomplicated hypertension: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"Study Purpose. To evaluate the effects of evidence-based treatment recommendations for hypertension made to physicians and pharmacists using a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Design. The randomized controlled trial with a 2x 2-factor design of physician and pharmacist interventions resulted in four patient groups: physician intervention only, pharmacist intervention only, physician and pharmacist intervention, and neither physician nor pharmacist intervention (control). Adjustment. Academic primary care internal medicine practice. Subjects Seven hundred and twelve patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Measurements and Main Results. Recommendations were shown to physicians on computer workstations used to write outpatient orders, and to pharmacists when writing prescriptions. The primary endpoint was overall health-related quality of life. Secondary endpoints were symptom profile and side effects of antihypertensive drugs, number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, patient satisfaction with physicians and pharmacists, adherence to medication, and healthcare costs. In the control group, care changes were applied in line with the treatment recommendations in 26% of the patients. Adherence to the recommendations was poor in the intervention groups, with 25% of patients given treatment advice only to pharmacists, 29% of patients advised only to physicians, and 35% of patients who received treatment advice. Suggestions were made to both physicians and pharmacists (p=0.13). Differences between groups were neither statistically significant nor clinically significant for overall health-related quality of life, symptom and side-effect profiles, number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, fees, or medication adherence. Solution. Computer-based intervention using an advanced electronic physician order entry system failed to improve adherence to treatment recommendations or outcomes for patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",0,1,
800,Fall prevention in acute care hospitals: a randomized trial.,"Context Falls cause injury and death for people of all ages, but the risk of falls increases markedly with age. Hospitalization further increases risk, but there is no evidence to support short-term hospital-based fall prevention strategies to reduce patient falls. Purpose To investigate whether a fall prevention toolkit (FPTK) using health information technology (HIT) can reduce patient falls in hospitals. Ordinary care (4 units and 5104 patients) or intervention (4 units and 5160 patients) at 4 urban US hospitals conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009. Intervention FPTK has integrated existing communication and workflow models into the HIT application. Based on a valid fall risk assessment scale completed by a nurse, the FPTK software adapted fall prevention interventions to address specific determinants of patients' fall risk. FPTK has produced short text bed posters with accompanying icons, patient education brochures and care plans, all of which convey patient-specific alerts to key stakeholders. Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome was patient reductions per 1000 patient-days adjusted for region and patient care unit. A secondary outcome was fall-related injuries. Results During the 6-month intervention period, the number of patients with falls differed between control (n = 87) and intervention (n = 67) units (P=.02). Site-adjusted drop rates were significantly higher in control units (4.18 per 1000 patient-days [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.45-5.06]) than in intervention units (3.15 [95% CI, 2.54-3.90] per 1000 patients). -days""; P = .04).

No significant effects were noted in fall-related injuries. Conclusion The use of the fall prevention toolkit in hospital units significantly reduced the fall rate compared to normal care.",0,1,
801,Requests by family members to extend physiological support after declaration of brain death: a case series analysis and recommended guidelines for clinical management.,"We describe and analyze 13 cases handled by our ethics consultation service (ECS) in which families requested continuation of physiological support for loved ones after death with neurological criteria (DNC). These ethics consultations took place between 2005 and 2013. The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 85 years. Continuous mechanical ventilation was the focal intervention that all families sought. ECS's advice and recommendations generally supported ""reasonable regulation"" of claims, balancing compassion for bereaved families with other ethical and moral concerns such as resource management, professional integrity, and moral distress. In what we have characterized as finite goal alignment, a ""reasonable fit"" strategy has proven effective in balancing stakeholder interests and goals and has led to steady progress towards a solution. When a family directly objected to the DNC statement and requested indefinite compliance, the ""reasonable fit"" approach gave clinicians little practical direction, and resolution required firm action, either by the family or the clinical team. Based on our analysis and reflection on these 13 cases, we propose ethically justified and practical guidelines to assist healthcare professionals, administrators and ECSs facing similar cases.",0,0,
802,Family-based interventions to increase physical activity in children: a meta-analysis and realistic synthesis protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the relationship established between physical activity and health, data show that many children are not active enough and these levels decline by adolescence. Involving the family in interventions can increase and maintain children's physical activity levels during the critical preschool period. The synthesis of the available evidence will inform future studies, but the heterogeneity in recruited target populations, the behavior change techniques and intervention strategies used, and the quantification may require a versatile review method. Therefore, the primary aim of this study will be to synthesize the evidence from intervention studies that explicitly engage the family unit to increase children's physical activity, using an innovative dual meta-analysis and a realistic approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Peer-reviewed studies, (1) including 'healthy' participants aged 5-12"";"" (2) have an important intervention goal to increase physical activity by involving the family; and (3) report on physical activity. Duplicate data extraction and quality assessment will be performed using a specially designed proforma and the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool, respectively. STATA software will be used to calculate effect sizes for meta-analyses and subgroup analyzes will be performed to identify moderator characteristics. Realistic syntheses will be conducted according to RAMESES quality and publication guidelines, including the development of a program theory and evidence mapping. DISCLOSURE: This review will be the first to use a traditional review framework to conduct a dual meta-analysis and realistic synthesis by examining family-engaging interventions to increase physical activity in children. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences, formal presentations to policy makers and practitioners, and informal meetings. Evidence from this synthesis will also be used to inform the development of theory-based, evidence-based interventions aimed at involving the family to increase children's physical activity levels.

804,Fast-track the design of theory-based KT interventions through a consensus process,"BACKGROUND: Despite the available evidence for optimal management of spinal cord pain, poor adherence to guidelines and wide variability in healthcare persists. One of the goals of the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative is to develop and evaluate targeted theory and evidence-based interventions by chiropractors to improve the treatment of nonspecific neck pain. To systematically develop a knowledge translation (CT) intervention supported by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we investigated the factors perceived to influence the use of multimodal care to manage nonspecific neck pain and mapped behavior modification techniques to basic theory. domains. METHODS: Individual telephone interviews investigating beliefs about managing neck pain were conducted with a purposive sample of 13 chiropractors. The interview guide was based on TDF. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed by two independent assessors using thematic content analysis. A 15-member expert panel formally met to design a KT intervention. RESULTS: Nine TDF areas were identified as likely relevant. Core beliefs (and related areas of TDF) included: the impact of formal education, colleagues, and patients on clinicians (Social Influences); availability of educational material (Environmental Context and Resources); and better clinical outcomes reinforcing the use of multimodal care (Reinforcement) Facilitating factors considered important include better communication (Skills), monitoring of patients' treatment outcomes (Behavioral Adjustment), awareness, and agreement with guidelines (Knowledge);"" and adapting multimodal care (Memory, Attention and Decision Processes). Clinicians reported conflicting beliefs about perceived threats to professional autonomy (Social/Professional Role and Identity) and speed of recovery from applying or ignoring practice recommendations (Beliefs About Outcomes). The expert panel mapped behavior change techniques to key theoretical areas and identified relevant KT strategies and delivery patterns to increase the use of multimodal care among chiropractors. CONCLUSIONS: A versatile KT training intervention has been developed targeting chiropractors' neck pain treatment. The KT intervention consisted of an online training webinar series, clinical stories, and a video powered by the Short Action Planning model. The intervention is designed to reflect key theoretical areas, behavior modification techniques, and intervention components. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention remains to be tested.",0,0,
805,Feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based practice strategies for mental health therapists practicing cognitive-behavioral therapy: a pilot study to inform a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Drawing on our previous work indicating that therapists are not recognized or rewarded for implementing evidence-based practice, we tested the feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based practice strategies aimed at improving therapist adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth. It is an evidence-based practice. Methods This study was conducted with therapists (n?=?11) and leaders (n?=?4) in two community mental health institutions for 6 weeks. Therapists were randomized to receive a financial or social incentive when they reached a predetermined criterion for adherence to cognitive-behavioral therapy. During the first intervention period (block 1""; 2 weeks), the therapists received an initially randomly selected reward if they met the criterion. During the second intervention period (block 2;"" 2 weeks), the therapists received both rewards when they reached the criterion. . The therapists recorded 41 sessions between 15 different clients over the duration of the project. Primary outcomes included feasibility and acceptability. The feasibility was evaluated quantitatively. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with therapists and leaders to assess acceptability. The difference in therapist compliance according to conditions was examined as an exploratory result. Compliance ratings were determined using an established and validated observational coding system of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results Both implementation strategies were feasible and acceptable; however, changes in study design will be required for the larger trial based on participant feedback. Regarding our exploratory analysis, we found a trend suggesting that financial reward may have a stronger effect on therapist commitment than social reward. Conclusions Incentive-based implementation strategies can be implemented in a practicable manner with good acceptability in community mental health institutions, although iterative piloting is necessary. Larger, fully powered trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of practice strategies to encourage and improve therapists' adherence to evidence-based practices such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.",1,1,
806,Feasibility and impact of computerized clinical decision support system on investigation and initial management of new-onset chest pain: a mixed methods study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can change clinician behavior, but the factors influencing their effects are not fully understood. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of a CDSS that supports diagnosis and treatment decisions in patients with suspected stable angina. METHODS: The Optimizing Intervention Angina (OMA) program includes a CDSS that guides research and medication decisions for clinicians managing patients with new-onset stable angina based on British national guidelines introduced through an educational intervention. Design and participants Mixed methods study i. A review of outcomes among patients presenting with suspected angina at three UK chest pain clinics before and after implementation of the OMA program. ii. Observations of clinical processes, interviews and a focus group with healthcare professionals at two chest pain clinics after the implementation of the OMA program. RESULTS: Medication and cardiovascular imaging studies performed within six months of presentation and their compliance with CDSS recommendations. Thematic analysis of qualitative data to understand how CDSS is used. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for 285 patients admitted to chest pain clinics: 106 before implementation of the OMA program and 179 after. 40 consultations were observed, met with 5 clinicians, and a focus group was organized after the intervention. The proportion of patients eligible for diagnostic investigation was 50% (95 CI 34-66%) of pre-OMA and 59% (95% CI 48-70%) post-OMA patients. Despite the high use of CDSS (84% of consultations), observations and interviews revealed the difficulties of data entry into CDSS and the structural and practical barriers to its use. In the majority of cases, CDSS was not used to guide real-time decision making, but was consulted only after the patient left the room. CONCLUSIONS: The OMA CDSS for the treatment of chest pain is not available in its current form. CDSS was not used to support decisions about the care of individual patients. A number of barriers to the use of CDSS have been identified, some easily circumvented, such as under-capturing cardiovascular risk, while others are more deeply embedded in current practice, such as the lack of some research or prescribing privileges for nurses.",0,1,
807,Feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled telemental health study with children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in underserved populations,"OBJECTIVE: Telemental health (TMH), the use of video teleconferencing to provide often personally delivered care, is increasingly being used to address inequalities in access to care. However, few studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMH as a service delivery model. The Children's Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Telemental Health Treatment Trial (CATTS) is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of TMH conducted in multiple underserved populations. This article reports the feasibility of TMH to experiment with an activity with children. METHODS: The CATTS trial used video teleconferencing to provide secure websites to provide guideline-based care and coordinate key aspects of trial implementation, such as participant recruitment and retention, response accuracy, and completion of assessments. RESULTS: The CATTS study co-involved seven communities and 150 primary care providers and enrolled 223 children aged 5.5-12.9 years. The intervention group completed an average of 5.3 of the 6.0 scheduled sessions, and 96% of the controls completed a TMH consultation. Both groups completed an average of 4.8 of the 5.0 assessments. Clinicians demonstrated high fidelity to treatment protocols. Minor technical difficulties did not hinder the provision of care. RESULTS: The CATTS study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a TMH RCT with children living in multiple underserved communities. Telecommunications technologies can facilitate coordination of research activities between sites and clinicians. Future research should work closely with study partners to ensure that a representative study sample is referred. More trials are needed to help establish the effectiveness of TMH as a service delivery model. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00830700 .",0,0,
808,Feasibility study of a communication and education asthma intervention for general practitioners in Australia,"The Physician Asthma Care Education (PACE) program has significantly improved the asthma prescribing and communication behaviors of primary care pediatricians in the US. We tested the feasibility and acceptability of a modified PACE program with Australian general practitioners (GPs) and measured its impact on self-reported counseling behaviors in a pilot study. Recruitment took place through a local GP division. Twenty-five GPs completed two PACE Australia workshops that focused on effective communication strategies and included pediatric asthma management in line with Australian asthma guidelines. The applicability, usefulness, and perceived usefulness of the program were measured by questionnaires before and 1 month after the workshop, and an evaluation questionnaire after each workshop. GP was universally enthusiastic and supportive of the workshops. The most helpful elements they reported were communication skills, case studies, device demonstrations, and the toolkit provided. GP, perceived usefulness of key communication strategies and self-reports on their implementation and reported frequency of use increased significantly after the workshops. The PACE program shows promise in improving the way the Australian GP manages asthma consultations, particularly with regard to doctor-patient communication. The impact of the modified PACE Australia program on family medicine care processes and outcomes for children with asthma is now being measured in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,

810,Feedback as a strategy to change behavior: the devil is in the details,"BACKGROUND: Performance feedback is one of a number of strategies used to improve clinical practice among students and clinicians. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this document were to examine the conceptual foundations and key components for auditing and feedback strategies, to evaluate the extent to which recently published audit and feedback interventions include these components, and to propose future guidelines for feedback to improve its educational and behavioral impact. . METHODS: Based on the actionable feedback model, we examined the existence of four theoretical constructs – timeliness, individualisation, lack of punishment, and customizability – in studies published in 2009–2010 that included a feedback intervention. RESULTS: There was wide variation in the definition, implementation and outcomes of 'feedback' interventions, making comparisons between studies difficult. None of the studies we reviewed included all components of the actionable feedback model. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback interventions reported to date often do not include concepts of behavior change, even if the results are positive. This may partly explain the great diversity in approaches and outcomes of such interventions and presents great challenges to replicate any intervention. Some standardization and certainly more clarity is needed in the specific action steps taken to apply behavioral theory to practice if feedback processes are to be used and disseminated and applied widely.",0,1,
811,Fibromyalgia treatment update,"Purpose of Review: Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain disorder characterized by complex symptomatology and few consistent effective treatments. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent literature covering treatment options from April 2005 to September 2006. RECENT FINDINGS: Previous evidence suggests that care-oriented drug therapy and self-management approaches may improve symptoms, function, and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the efficacy of two serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors—duloxetine and milnacipran—and the anticonvulsant pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an important component of any treatment plan for the patient with fibromyalgia. Three studies were added to the understanding of adherence to treatment. Finally, three studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added to the information clinicians need to have meaningful conversations with patients. SUMMARY: Recent studies support the recommendation for a multimodal approach to treatment that includes individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-administration. Treatment goals should include improving symptoms, particularly pain and sleep, and promoting positive health behaviors to improve physical function and emotional well-being.",0,0,
812,Financial incentives to quit smoking during pregnancy: randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE To evaluate the effectiveness of financial incentives added to routine specialist pregnancy smoking cessation services versus routine care to help pregnant smokers quit. DESIGN Phase II therapeutic discovery single-center, individual randomized controlled parallel group superiority trial. SETTING A large medical board area with a financially deprived inner-city population in the west of Scotland, UK. PARTICIPANTS 612, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, English speaking, at least 16 years old, less than 24 weeks pregnant and pregnant smokers with an exhaled carbon monoxide breath test result of 7 ppm or more. 306 women were randomized to incentives and 306 to controls. INTERVENTIONS Routine care for the control group, face-to-face meeting to quit and quit smoking, 10 weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy from pharmacy services to those who attended and set a quit date, and four weeks of support phone calls. The intervention group was offered routine care plus up to £400 shopping vouchers: £50 to attend a face-to-face appointment and set a drop off date""; then another £50 if four years later confirmed exhaled carbon monoxide after quit date weeks later ; after 12 weeks an additional ""£100"" for continued confirmed deprivation of exhaled carbon monoxide; a final ""£200"" voucher provided for confirmed exhaled carbon monoxide MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Primary outcome, 34-38. Confirmed release of cotinine via saliva (<14.2 ng/mL) or urine (<44.7 ng/mL) at gestational week. Secondary outcomes are birth weight, engagement, and self-reported quitting at 4 weeks. RESULTS Recruitment to achieve target sample size 12 months to 15 weeks. extended to one month Follow-up continued until September 2013 Three of 306 randomized women went out of control soon after enrollment; these women did not want their data to be used, leavin g 306 intervention and 303 control group participants were analyzed with intent to treat. No harm from financial incentives has been documented. Significantly more smokers in the incentive group than the control group quit: 69 (22.5%) versus 26 (8.6%). The relative risk of not smoking at the end of pregnancy was 2.63 (95% confidence interval 1.73 to 4.01) P<0.001. The absolute risk difference was 14.0% (95% confidence interval 8.2% to 19.7%). The number to be treated (in cases where financial incentives must be offered to obtain a late pregnancy survivor) was 7.2 (95% confidence interval 5.1 to 12.2). Mean birth weight was 3140 g (SD 600 g) in the incentive group and 3120 (SD 590) g in the control group (P=0.67). CONCLUSION This phase II randomized controlled trial provides substantial evidence for the effectiveness of incentives to quit smoking during pregnancy; “As this is only a single center trial, incentives must now be tested in different types of contraception services and in different parts of the UK.

813,FIRE (facilitating the application of research evidence): a study protocol,"Background Research evidence supports best practice, but is not always used in healthcare. The Promoting Action on Research Practice in Healthcare (PARIHS) framework suggests that the nature of the evidence, the context in which it is used, and whether those trying to use evidence are assisted (or facilitated) influence evidence use. Urinary incontinence has a significant impact on the quality of life of older people, has a high prevalence and is a key priority in European health and social care policy. Improving continence care has the potential to improve quality of life for older people and reduce the costs associated with providing incontinence aids. Objectives This study aims to improve understanding of the contribution that facilitation can make to putting research findings into practice: to expand existing facilitation knowledge as a process to translate research evidence into practice; assessing the feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two different methods Facilitation models to encourage the acquisition of research evidence on continence management; assessing the impact of contextual factors on implementation processes and outcomes; and implement a proactive strategy of knowledge transfer and dissemination to disseminate study findings to the broad policy and practice community. Establishment and sample Four European countries, each with six long-term nursing care centers (24 regions in total) for persons aged 60 and over with documented urinary incontinence Methods and design Tri-arm (standard dissemination and two different treatment programmes) facilitation), embedded process and economic with evaluation. The primary outcome is compliance with continence recommendations. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of residents with incontinence, the incidence of incontinence-related dermatitis, urinary tract infections, and quality of life. Outcomes are evaluated at baseline, then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the start of facilitation interventions. Detailed contextual and process data is collected through interviews with staff, residents and relatives, observations, assessment of context using the Alberta Context Tool, and documentary evidence. A realistic evaluation framework is used to develop explanatory theory about what works for whom under what circumstances.",0,0,

815,Early psychosis: a window of opportunity for best practices,"Patients experiencing a first psychotic episode or early stages of psychosis face important diagnostic challenges for clinicians. During the presentation of first episode psychosis, it is crucial for clinicians to select the most effective treatment option because immediate intervention offers the best chance of controlling the disease. It is also important to choose the best treatment option during this period, because functional deterioration occurs most rapidly in this early period, which may alter the patient's future prognosis, the level of treatment required, and affect morbidity. Although research has shown a reduction in brain gray matter in people who develop psychosis and have symptoms of functional impairment, many patients with psychosis do not seek treatment and visit a clinician for a long time because of denial, fear of stigma, inadequacy. recognize the problem or complexity of maintenance systems. Previous studies have shown that when the psychosis is untreated, the patient outcome is worse during the course of the illness than if the psychosis was previously treated. There are a number of treatment options available for the treatment of psychosis, including the use of first-generation or second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Clinicians should keep in mind that both types of drugs are associated with certain side effects, such as tardive dyskinesia and weight gain, respectively. For both types of drugs, doses should be lower in patients with a first psychotic episode than in patients with chronic psychosis. Finally, patients may present with various comorbidities that may affect treatment, such as substance abuse. This specialist roundtable supplement will address diagnosis and choice of treatment of first-stage psychosis, as well as comorbidities associated with the condition. The use of first- or second-generation antipsychotics for the treatment of psychosis, dosing guidelines, and the antipsychotic side-effect profile will also be discussed.",0,0,
816,Format change of a lab test order form affects physician behavior,"OBJECTIVE: Our study was designed to find out whether a change in the physician's lab test sequence could be achieved with the simple strategy of changing the setup of a lab order form with checkbox embedded in a computerized medical record. METHODS: This prospective intervention study was conducted at Maccabi Healthcare Services, a Preferred Provider Organization that has used computerized medical records since 1992. We analyzed data from 865 primary care physicians over 3 years. In May 2005 we changed the order form and reduced the number of tests that can be ordered using a checkbox form from 51 to 26. Twenty-seven tests were removed from the form and two tests were added. The total number of laboratory test orders and the median proportion of test orders per visit to the physician during each study period were calculated for each test separately. RESULTS: The tests added to the computerized laboratory order form increased by 60.7% in the first year and by 90% in the following year. For the unchanged tests, the percentages of change in the same periods were +18.4 and 22.4%. The change for the deleted tests was -27% and -19.2% for the respective years. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the format of laboratory test order forms can be useful in conjunction with other interventions to improve the compliance of laboratory tests by the physician, which can change the test order. A carefully constructed test order form can strengthen clinical guidelines for the performance of some preventive testing and follow-up.",1,1,
817,Formative assessment of practice changes to manage depression within a Shared Care model in primary care,"Purpose To explore the application and initial impact of Physician Integrated Network (PIN) mental health indicators specific to managing screening and follow-up for depression in three primary care practices with Shared Mental Health Care in Manitoba. BACKGROUND: In 2006, Manitoba Health undertook a primary care replacement initiative called PIN, which involved the development of specific mental health indicators to manage screening and follow-up for depression. These indicators were implemented in Manitoba at three PIN group enforcement sites that are also part of the Joint Mental Health Services. METHODS: The design was a non-experimental longitudinal design. A formative assessment explored the application and initial impact of mental health indicators using mixed methods (document review, questionnaire, and interview). Quantitative data were searched using descriptive and comparative statistics, and content and theme analysis of the qualitative interviews was carried out. Questionnaire responses were obtained from 32 of 36 physicians from three centers. Interviews were held with 15 providers. Results This assessment revealed service providers' perceived attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors regarding recognizing and treating depression and broadened our understanding of primary care processes for managing depression in relation to the implementation of a new intervention. Depression is seen as an important problem in primary care practice that takes time for diagnosis, treatment and treatment and requires further research. The application of PIN mental health indicators was variable between sites and providers. There has been an increase in the use of indicators over time and there is a general consensus that the benefits of screening outweigh the costs"";"" however, the benefit of screening for depression remains unclear. Consistent with current guidelines, a question raised by the findings of this review is whether there are more effective ways of making an impact on depression in primary care than screening.",0,0,
818,Promoting the application of health care research findings: a unified framework for advancing applied science,"Background Many interventions found to be effective in healthcare research studies cannot be translated into meaningful patient care outcomes in more than one context. Health care researchers recognize the need to evaluate not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes in order to assess the extent to which practice is effective in a given setting, prolonging sustainability, and promoting diffusion into other settings. Many practice theories have been published to help promote effective practice. However, they overlap significantly in the structures contained in the individual theories, and comparison of the theories reveals that each is missing the important structures contained in the other theories. Also, terminology and definitions are not consistent across theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework for Application Research (CFIR), which offers a comprehensive typology to encourage application theory development and validation of what works where and why in multiple contexts. Methods We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated to identify constructs based on the strength of conceptual or empirical support for impact on practice, consistency in definitions, agreement with our own findings, and potential for measurement. We combined constructs between published theories that had different labels but were either redundant or overlapped in definition, and we parsed constructs that combined key concepts. Outcomes CFIR consists of five main areas: response characteristics, external environment, internal environment, characteristics of the individuals involved, and the implementation process. Eight constructs related to the intervention were identified (eg, strength and quality of evidence), four constructs related to the external environment (eg, patient needs and resources), 12 constructs related to the internal environment (eg, culture, leadership involvement), five constructs related to individual characteristics were identified and eight process-related constructs were identified (eg, plan, evaluate, and reflect). We provide clear definitions for each structure. Conclusion CFIR provides a pragmatic framework for approaching the complex, interactive, multi-level, and transient states of real-world structures by embracing, consolidating, and combining fundamental structures from published application theories. It can be used to guide formative assessments and build a knowledge base of practice across multiple studies and settings.",0,0,
819,Founder and Recurrent CDH1 Mutations in Families with Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer,"Context Hereditary disseminated gastric cancer is caused by germline mutations in the epithelial cadherin (CDH1) gene and is characterized by an increased risk for disseminated gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Purpose To determine whether recurrent germline CDH1 mutations result from independent mutational events or from a common ancestor. Design, Environment, and Patients Thirty-eight families diagnosed with clinically inherited diffuse gastric cancer were accrued between November 2004 and January 2006 and analyzed for CDH1 mutations as part of an ongoing study at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Twenty-six families had at least 2 cases of gastric cancer and 1 common case of gastric cancer in a person younger than 50"";"" In 12 families, there was either a single case of common stomach cancer diagnosed in someone younger than 35, or multiple cases of common stomach cancer diagnosed in people older than 50. Main Outcome Criteria Classification of family members as carriers or non-carriers of CDH1 mutations. To evaluate recurrent mutations for the common ancestor, haplotype analysis was performed on 7 families from this study and 7 previously reported families with the same mutations. Results Thirteen mutations (6 new) were detected in 15 of 38 families (40% detection rate). The 1137G>A splicing mutation and the 1901C>T (A634V) missense/splicing mutation occurred in shared haplotypes in 2 families, but different haplotypes in a third family. The 2195G>A (R732Q) missense/splicing mutation occurred in 2 families with different haplotypes. The 2064-2065delTG mutation occurred in a shared haplotype in 2 families. Two families from this study plus 2 additional families carrying the novel 2398delC mutation shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. All 4 families hail from the southeast coast of Newfoundland. Due to the high incidence of lobular breast cancer, 2 branches of this family were diagnosed with hereditary breast cancer and tested for BRCA mutations. Within these 4 families, the cumulative risk for clinically detected gastric cancer in carriers of the mutation up to age 75 years was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12-91%) and 63% (95% CI, 19%) for males. was. for females -99%) and female mutation carriers had a 52% (95% CI, 29-94%) risk of breast cancer. Conclusions Recurrent CDH1 mutations in families with hereditary disseminated gastric cancer result from both independent mutational events and a common ancestry. The existence of a founder mutation from Newfoundland is strongly supported.",0,0,

821,Framework for quality improvement in pharmaceutical services -- a bridge to bridge the quality gap. Part I. Opportunity and tool,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on quality improvement principles and methods applied to pharmacy services and to define a framework for current and future efforts in quality improvement and effective drug therapy management in pharmacy services. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy produced the Pharmacy Quality Indicators Catalogue in 1997, followed by the National Summary of Pharmacy Quality Measures in February 1999. In April 2002, AMCP introduced Pharmacy's Framework for Management of Drug Therapy in the 21st Century. The framework documents include a self-assessment tool detailing more than 250 specific ""components"" that identify tasks, behaviors, skills, functions, duties, and responsibilities that contribute to meeting client expectations for effective medication management. RESULTS: There are many opportunities for quality improvement in clinical, service, and cost outcomes associated with drug therapy management. These include ""patient safety""; incidence of medical errors; adverse drug events; patient adherence to treatment; achievement of targeted goals such as blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels; risk reduction for adverse cardiac events and osteoporotic-related fractures; patient satisfaction; risk of hospitalization or death; "" and maintenance cost. Health care practitioners may experience (a) a better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) the same patient outcome at a lower cost, (c) a better patient outcome at a lower cost, or (d) a significantly better outcome at a moderately higher cost. a patient outcome. Measurement enables effective management. A framework of component factors (eg tasks) is needed to facilitate changes in key processes and critical factors that will help individual practitioners and health care systems meet client expectations for drug therapy and thereby improve these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement in healthcare in the United States will be made through incremental changes based on a structure-process-result model. The structure is provided by evidence from controlled randomized trials and other scientific method-based studies of care and systems outcomes. The process part is created by applying evidence in the form of clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice models, and self-assessment tools such as the Pharmacy's Medication Management Framework. Gradual changes in structure and process will result in the desired outcome of meeting client needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.",0,0,
822,Framing options as choices or opportunities: does the framework influence decisions?,"Aim. Healthcare professionals should present all options in an impartial manner, enabling patients to make informed decisions about their healthcare choices. This study examined whether the decision in the context of trial participation for cancer treatment is presented as an ""opportunity"" rather than the preferences of individuals with ""choice"" bias. Methods Self-selected healthy women (N = 124) were randomly assigned to the following decision frames: opportunity to participate in the trial (opt-in), opportunity to opt out of the trial (opt-out), and option to standardize treatment or take part in the trial (choice). The computer-based task required women to make a hypothetical choice about a real-world cancer treatment trial. The software presented the framed scenario, recorded the first choice, presented comprehensive and balanced information, monitored the participants' information use during decision making, and recorded the final decision. A post-task paper questionnaire assessed perceived risk, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and satisfaction with the decision. Results. Framing affected women's immediate choices. Opportunity frames, whether to participate or to opt out, created a bias as they discouraged women from choosing standard treatment. Using the marquee avoided this bias. The opt-out opportunity framework also impacted women's perceived social norms"";"" women felt that others approved of the option to try. Framing bias was absent when participants had the opportunity to see detailed information about options within a patient decision aid format. There were no group differences in information acquisition and final decisions. Sixteen percent changed their first choice after receiving full information. Results. A 'choice' framework in which all treatment options are open is less likely to influence choices. Presenting complete information in a parallel, feature-based format is likely to “eliminate bias” in the decision framework. Tailoring information to initial preferences is not recommended, as preferences may change after detailed information.",0,1,

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost and effectiveness of repetitive fibrin glue injection and to investigate whether these results change physicians' attitudes. DESIGN: A retrospective random sample of five hospitals from the previous study, aggregation of the cost description, and follow-up data on 320 patients (155 in the polidocanol group, 165 in the fibrin glue group). METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and comparison of results was performed using chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. A survey was conducted using a questionnaire on local guidelines for the management of ulcer bleeding in five hospitals and the results were analyzed qualitatively. The measure of effectiveness is the number of rebleeds avoided. Other variables were length of hospital stay and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The cost of preventing one additional rebleeding with repeated fibrin sealant treatment is 14,316 +/- 4981 Euros (increased cost-effectiveness ratio). There was no significant difference in length of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital. Physicians did not change their management plan for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. One survey found that other factors, such as local guidelines, attitudes towards new treatment options, and ease of use of drugs, were more important to physicians' behavior change than the outcome of a single study. CONCLUSIONS: The study was not designed to address a pharmacoeconomic question prospectively. This may lead to biased estimates of the increased cost-effectiveness ratio, as the relevant variables (eg, length of stay in the intensive care unit) cannot be reliably determined retrospectively.",0,0,
826,From evidence to expertise: compliance in the topical treatment of psoriasis,"Vulgar psoriasis is a chronic and intermittent inflammatory cutaneous-systemic disease. Its etiology is not fully defined and the risk of comorbidity affecting the quality of life of patients is higher. The aims of this trial were to ""align the clinical practice of the pharmacological treatment of plaque psoriasis with the Guia de Practica Clinica (GPC)"" and a group of Mexican dermatologists specializing in the topical treatment of psoriasis, as well as weighing the relevance and knowledge of quality of life and adherence to treatment. A Delphi questionnaire was administered to 30 specialists to explore their therapeutic behaviors and attitudes towards the evaluation of the patient. A meeting was held with a subgroup of 10 dermatologists to analyze the results. A second survey was conducted to distinguish between decisions made for topical treatment in institutional and private practice, as well as other substances not discovered in the first questionnaire. The questionnaire was answered.After analyzing the results of the questionnaire, it was clear that the data published in the Guia de Practica Clinica and the prescriptive position of the experts were consistent with regard to the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis.The use of vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids in the private practice is better. There is also consensus among physicians in private and institutional medical care regarding the attitude to drug prescriptions, although salicylic acid is widely used and is replacing corticosteroids in institutions.",0,0,
827,From hypertension control to global cardiovascular risk management: an educational intervention in a clustered randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for hypertension management recommend that treatment efforts be adjusted for global cardiovascular risk (CVR) rather than blood pressure levels alone. However, this paradigm shift has not yet reached German General Practice. We evaluated the impact of an educational outreach visit with general practitioners (GPs) and encouraged them to consider CVR in treatment decisions for patients with hypertension. METHODS: Prospective cluster randomized study involving 3443 patients with known hypertension treated by 87 GPs. Applications were randomly assigned to either complex (A) or simple (B) intervention. Both groups received a guide by mail"";"" Group A also received complex peer intervention supporting the global concept of CVR. Clinical data were collected at baseline and 6-9 months after intervention. The main outcome was improvement in the calculated CVR in a predefined subpopulation of patients with a high CVR (10-year mortality >/=5%) but without significant cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: The baseline follow-up CVR was 13.1% (95% CI 12.6-13.6%) (A) and 12.6% (95% CI 12.2-13.1%) (B) with group difference (A vs. A). B) 0.5% (-0.2%-1.1%), p = 0.179. The group difference was -0.05% in GP patients familiar with global CVR and 1.1% in GP patients unfamiliar with global CVR. However, this change in effect was not significant (p = 0.165). When pooled over the groups, the absolute CVR reduction from baseline was 1.0%, p < 0.001. The ICC was 0.026 (p = 0.002). Hypertension control (BP <140/90 mmHg) improved from 38.1% to 45.9% in the complex intervention group and from 35.6% to 46.5% in the simple intervention group in the same subpopulation, with adjusted follow-up control rates of 46.7% (95) % CI 40.4%-53.1% (A) and 46.9% (95% CI 40.3%-53.5% (B) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.68-1), 45) an adjusted odds ratio (A - B), p = 0.966 RESULTS: Our complex education intervention, including a clinical outreach visit, had a significant effect on the CVR of patients with hypertension who are known to be at high risk compared to a simple postal intervention.

828,The interdisciplinary integrated care of the child with autism: the fundamental role of a code of ethics,"Various disciplines have come to the fore in intervention programs to address the developmental deficiencies of children with autism. These are speech pathologists, psychologists/counselors, occupational therapists/physical therapists, special education counselors, behavioral analysts, and doctors/medical staff. As the field of autism therapy moves towards a more comprehensive, holistic and interdisciplinary model, the complexity of an interdisciplinary model of service delivery can present significant challenges. The difficulty of taking this approach can lead to the creation of below-average programs.

831,Functional Recovery After Myocardial Infarction in Men: Independent Effects of Social Class,"Background: Social class has been repeatedly associated with cardiovascular disease and death, but no studies have examined the effect of social class on recovery from myocardial infarction. In addition, few studies have simultaneously evaluated a wide array of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors that may affect health outcomes after myocardial infarction. Objective: To determine whether social class is independently associated with functional recovery after myocardial infarction, even after clinical control. Demographic and psychosocial factors known to affect post-infarction outcomes. Design: Analysis of prospective data from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Setting: Attack Trial, including 25 hospital or clinical setting Health Insurance Plan substudies participating in Beta Blocker Heart in the United States and Canada. Patients: 2145 men aged 29 to 69 years hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and enrolled in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial. Measurements: The primary outcome was change in the New York Heart Association. The functional class difference between baseline assessment and 12 months later was divided into improved or undeveloped (ie no change, decline in at least one category, or death). Results: Social class maintained its independent influence on improved functional status even after controlling for relevant prognostic factors. At 1 year after infarction, people from high social class were significantly more likely to have better functional status than people from low or middle social class. Some clinical, demographic, and psychosocial features were associated with improvement, but the effect of social class could not be explained by these additional features. Conclusions: Social class has a significant influence on recovery from myocardial infarction and may explain the differences in clinical outcomes.",0,0,
832,Functional Somatic Syndromes,"The term functional somatic syndrome has been applied to several associated syndromes characterized by symptoms, suffering, and disability rather than the tissue abnormality that can be consistently demonstrated. These syndromes include multiple chemical sensitivities, sick building syndrome, repetitive stress injury, side effects of silicone breast implants, Gulf War syndrome, chronic whiplash, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Patients with functional somatic syndromes have clear and highly detailed self-diagnoses, and their symptoms are often resistant to reassurance, explanation, and standard treatment of symptoms. They share similar phenomenology, high rates of association, similar epidemiological features, and higher-than-expected prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities. Although some patients with functional somatic syndrome may eventually have discrete pathophysiological causes, their suffering is exacerbated by a self-perpetuating, self-affirming cycle in which common, endemic, somatic symptoms are incorrectly attributed to serious abnormalities. The patient's belief that he or she has a serious illness. Four psychosocial factors drive this cycle of symptom amplification: the person's belief that they have a serious illness; the expectation that the person's condition will worsen; the ""sick role"", including the effects of litigation and compensation; and the eerie portrayal of the situation as catastrophic and crippling. The climate surrounding functional somatic syndromes It includes sensational media coverage, deep suspicion of medical expertise and doctors, the mobilization of parties with self-interest in the status of functional somatic syndromes, litigation, and a clinical approach that overemphasizes biomedical factors and ignores psychosocial factors. exacerbates and perpetuates their distress, heightens their fears and pessimistic expectations, prolongs their disability, and reinforces patient roles.A six-step strategy for helping patients with functional somatic syndromes is presented here.",0,0,
833,gastroesophageal reflux disease,"Heartburn 2 or more days a week requires medical attention as patients are likely to suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Chronic GERD can lead to the development of complications such as erosive esophagitis, stricture formation and Barrett's esophagus, which increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A trial with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the fastest and most cost-effective way to diagnose GERD and is at least as accurate as 24-hour intraoesophageal pH monitoring. Because PPIs only bind to actively secreting proton pumps, they should be dosed 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Despite these recommendations, a recent survey of more than 1,000 US primary care physicians found that 36% of patients instructed their patients to take a PPI with or after a meal, or did not specify the timing of dosing. Patients who will respond best to surgical treatment for GERD are those who have clearly documented acid reflux with typical symptoms and respond to PPI therapy. Unfortunately, the same survey found that most doctors recommend antireflux surgery for patients for whom medical treatment has failed.",0,0,

835,Information seeking strategies for general practice trainees' clinical queries encountered in daily practice,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that clinical inquiries are common among physicians. Data on the information-seeking behavior of general practice (GP) trainees are scarce and the numbers studied are small. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how often and how GP trainees seek answers to clinical questions encountered in daily clinical practice. METHODS: Third-year GP trainees kept records of all patient contacts for eight consecutive practice days. Information was obtained about patient contacts (description), clinical inquiries (frequency, type), search behavior (frequency, moment, reason for not calling, resources used, search duration), and responses (frequency, effect). Descriptive analyzes performed"";"" frequencies and percentages were calculated. We calculated the number of clinical queries per patient, the number of searches per query, and the number of responses per search. RESULTS: Seventy-six trainees reported 1533 clinical queries on 7300 patients with 7619 complaints [mean 0.2 queries per patient, standard deviation (SD) 0.1]. For most of the queries, trainees sought an answer (mean 0.8 per query, SD 0.2) mostly during consultation (61% of searches), and frequent responses (mean 0.8 per call, SD 0.17) reported improving clinical decision, making 26%. The most common sources were colleagues or supervisors (28%) and national GP guidelines (26%). The median duration of a call was 4 minutes (interquartile range 3). CONCLUSION: GP trainees have one clinical inquiry for every five patients. They often tried to find answers and reported that they were successful in most of the searches, especially in consultation with their superiors or colleagues and national GP guidelines.",0,0,
836,General practitioner views on the determinants of test order: a theory-based qualitative approach to the development of an intervention to improve immunoglobulin demands in primary care.,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that variation in laboratory demanding patterns may indicate unnecessary test use. Demand patterns for serum immunoglobulins vary considerably among general practitioners (GPs). This study aims to explore GP's views on testing to identify determinants of behavior and to suggest appropriate intervention strategies to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs requesting laboratory tests at University Hospital Cork or University Hospital Kerry in Southern Ireland. GPs were determined using the Healthcare Executive lab list of GPs in the Cork-Kerry area. A random sample of GPs (stratified according to GP claiming patterns) was generated from this list. GPs, location (urban/rural)""; length of time they were qualified;"" consciously sampled according to the criteria. and application size (one-handed/group). The interviews were conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. The interviews were transcribed verbatim using NVivo 10 software and analyzed using the frame analysis method. The resulting themes were paired with the theoretical domain framework (TDF), which outlined 12 domains that could enable or inhibit behavior change. The behavior modification wheel and behavior modification technique (BCT) classification were then used to identify potential intervention strategies. RESULTS: Sixteen practitioners were interviewed (ten men and six women). The findings suggest that intervention strategies should specifically target key barriers to effective test sequencing, taking into account the context of primary care practice. Seven domains from the TDF were perceived to influence immunoglobulin test ordering behaviors and were described as 'mechanisms of change' (knowledge, environmental context and resources, social/professional role and identity, beliefs about abilities, beliefs about outcomes, memory, attention, and decision). - making processes and behavioral regulation). Using these TDF domains, seven BCTs emerged as appropriate 'intervention content' to target GPs' ordering behavior. These include how to order the test effectively (how to conduct behavior), information about GPs' use of the test (feedback on behavior), information about patient outcomes as a result of not performing the test (information about health outcomes), laboratory/consultant-based advice/education ( reliable source), modifying the test order form (reconfiguring the physical environment), providing guidelines (prompts/tips), and adding interpretative comments to the results (adding objects to the environment). These BCTs are aligned with four intervention functions: education, persuasion, environmental restructuring, and activation. CONCLUSIONS: This study effectively applied behavior modification theory to identify appropriate strategies to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care using TDF, 'behavior modification wheel' and BCT taxonomy. The identified BCTs will form the basis of a theory-based intervention to improve the use of immunoglobulin tests among GPs. Future research will include the development and evaluation of this intervention.",0,0,
837,Reasons for general practitioners' failure to implement epilepsy guidelines in primary care in a randomized controlled trial (TIGER Trial),"OBJECTIVE: To explore the reasons for the failure of a randomized controlled trial to influence the application of epilepsy guidelines in primary care and to theorize about possible contexts in which guidelines will lead to changes in clinician behavior. METHODS: Qualitative study based on focus groups and a single in-depth interview. Participants included 47 primary health care professionals selected from a purposive sample of 13 urban and rural general practices. CONCLUSIONS: The main reason for the Scottish Inter-University Guideline Network epilepsy guideline not being implemented was an established model of GP behavior supported by practice staff and perceived as having little need for change. Secondly, there were perceived difficulties in implementing the guideline due to lack of knowledge of the existence and/or content of the guideline, and resource constraints and possible patient resistance. Therefore, clinicians' individual behavior was based on broader service structures and policies. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines may be more likely to apply where there are perceived problems in current service delivery. Attempts to facilitate the implementation of guidelines may also focus on areas where the need for guidance is already perceived or where there is a deterioration in one of the key variables that maintain the role and practice of the healthcare professional. They may also be more likely where initiatives focus on a wider area than individual physician behavior and are more broadly geared towards redesigning broader systems of care delivery, involving other providers to achieve care coordination, improve patient self-management, and use information technology tools.",0,0,
838,General practitioners' adoption of clinical practice guidelines: a qualitative study,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent rapid controlled change in the uptake of locally applied, evidence-based clinical guidelines for asthma and angina in primary care. METHODS: A case study of primary care in two matched, contiguous areas in northern England, focusing on a stratified random sample of 49 general practitioners (GPs) from eight primary care groups. Data were collected from three cycles of mainly qualitative interviews conducted at six-month intervals before and after local guidelines were published and after audit data were collected. Interviews examined attitudes, awareness and impact of locally disseminated asthma and angina guidelines, and follow-up supervision. Audit data on guideline acquisition were also obtained from a parallel study. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in guideline intake observed in both the intervention and control groups was not explained by individual practitioners or practice factors. The findings are attributed to GPs' awareness of evidence-based medicine policies, new healthcare institutions, and clinical governance activities of primary care groups. Behavior change reflects GPs' clinical decisions as well as their decisions about what to record in case notes, so findings may reflect changing perceptions about accountability rather than preferred treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline preparation and dissemination is best seen in the context of broader policy change. Guideline implementation studies should report data before and after and include important qualitative components to identify important contextual factors.",0,0,
839,Antibiotic management by the general surgeon: Climbing the Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Curve-Forward Cohort Study,"INTRODUCTION: The primary aim of this study was to determine the compliance of the general surgeon's prescribing practice with local IV-oral antibiotic guidelines. The secondary aim was to assess the impact of introducing educational antibiotic measures. The Rogers Diffusion Model of Innovation was used to investigate the adoption of antibiotic management practices. METHODS: In this prospective, cohort study, data were collected from 100 patients before and 100 after the mindfulness intervention program. The educational intervention included a) guidelines b) pre-intervention outcomes c) raising awareness about the introduction of an IV-oral antibiotic prompt form. Compliance with local guidelines was compared between pre- and post-intervention groups using the Fisher's Exact Test or the Pearson's Chi Test (SPSS Statistics V22). CONCLUSIONS: General surgeons' compliance with local IV-oral antibiotic guidelines was poor and did not improve significantly following the awareness intervention program. There was no reception of the antibiotic prompt page. 48-72. There was an increase in the number of patients switching from IV to oral antibiotics per hour and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the number of patients with a clearly documented intention to review IV antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic governance measures failed to inspire even the first group of innovators to use antibiotic claim pages. Educational measures appear to be effective in improving prescribing behavior and intent among an early adopter group, but this fails to reach a critical mass. To improve antibiotic management and begin the Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Curve, more needs to be done to involve general surgeons in prescribing antibiotics in a timely and reasonable manner.",0,0,
840,Genetic evaluation of oocyte donors: recipient couple preferences and test outcome,"OBJECTIVE: To report the preferences of recipient couples for genetic testing of oocyte donors. DESIGN: Observational report of results from a form of genetic testing options administered as part of routine care. SETTING: Special application. PATIENT(S): Recipients and oocyte donors. INTERVENTION(S): Recipient couples completed a form prior to screening of oocyte donors stating required screening and recommended tests that the couple could accept or reject. The couples were informed about the frequency of carriers, the risk and cost for their children in case of abnormal results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of couples who accepted optional testing. RESULT(s): Out of 63 couples with data from the initial test options form, 42 (67%) accepted, 21 (33%) refused the fragile X test, 34 (54%) agreed, and 29 (% 46) refused karyotyping. When asked whether they would accept additional testing of their donor if recommended by a genetic counselor, 15 (24%) stated that they would accept additional testing at any cost, 35 (56%) refused, and 13 (20%) stated. He said his decisions will depend on cost. In most cases, a history was taken by the genetic counselor or test results were obtained that influence further testing, decisions to continue, or provide important information for the child. CONCLUSION(s): Recipient couples chose to refuse tests that we sometimes recommend but do not require, despite the relatively low cost of this test compared to the total cost of the oocyte donation cycle.",0,0,

842,Genetic support for primary care practitioners - a demonstration project,"Primary care practitioners need to be supported by specialist genetics services to enable them to effectively cope with the growing interest of genetics with their patients. Genetic counselors can be effective in such a role. This exploration project aimed to improve the Primary-Tertiary interface by piloting such a service to general implementation for 1 year. Special genetic education support was delivered by a genetic counselor to ten randomly selected general practices in central England over 12 months. A range of services were provided to the apps, including streamlined genetic update sessions, a responsive advice service, and referral guidelines. Service was assessed through pre- and post-intervention questionnaires and seven semi-structured interviews. This article provides a description of the development and delivery of this service and also reports the experience of a sample of participants. Respondents reported positive attitudes towards the service and said they gained knowledge and confidence, as well as recognized limitations and gaps in their current knowledge. Consistent connectivity with a specialist genetics service provided by the genetic counselor has had a positive impact throughout the project, and participants have continued to use the genetic counselor for advice and support regarding genetic patient issues since the project was completed. This is the first example of this service delivery model. More research using a larger sample and other measures of behavior change is needed to assess whether this model is being adopted on a broader basis.",0,0,
843,German translation of the Suicide Patient Observation Chart (SPOC) - an application tool,"Caring for suicidal inpatients is a complex and responsible task. Direct and immediate intensive care and therapeutic supervision, also known as private observation, is still recommended in guidelines (DGPPN, 2012) and is perhaps one of the most used interventions in the care of inpatient suicidal patients. It includes many variants to enhance the relationship between observer and patient. The original SPOC was developed in Sweden to improve the quality of a systematic documentation during the surveillance of suicidal patients. It is a tool that provides systematic documentation of observational behavior or apparent mood during an acute suicidal crisis, such as other possible influencing factors such as ""anxious, anxious"" or ""sudden mood swings"". In this way, the SPOC can ensure the process of systematically documenting the particular observation and improve its quality, namely who documents what and when. In addition, SPOC can facilitate better communication of the observation process to the multidisciplinary team and the patient. SPOC includes 28 items and covers 24 different observation periods. The purpose of this article is to establish the translation process from English to German SPOC version. The translation process followed a five-stage model. In the first step, the English version was translated by two native German speakers. In the second step, the first two translation results discussed by the Expert group (authors) and a new version were developed. In the third step, the first German version (two native speakers) was translated back into English. The fourth step was taken by expert groups (authors) to review the results and establish what is called a ""pre-release"". The final step includes proof of content validity by 52 nurses. Evidence was able to spot several misunderstandings and helped improve the tool in its final version. German-speaking nursing practice in psychiatry with translation has a tool that psychiatric nurses can use in their complex interventions to this special patient group.",0,0,
844,Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy as vascular risk signals: review and grading of the evidence.,"The emergence of common pregnancy-related medical disorders puts women at higher risk of developing vascular disease in the future. Systematic reviews of cohort studies show that gestational diabetes has a 7-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes, and preeclampsia provides a 1.8-fold increased risk for type 2 diabetes and a 3.4-fold increased risk for hypertension. Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increase the risk of early vascular disease, but the 2-fold increased risk associated with preeclampsia can only be partially explained by the development of traditional vascular risk factors. Despite convincing evidence for gestational diabetes and HDP as vascular risk indicators, there are no published Canadian vascular prevention guidelines recognizing these postpartum women. In contrast, 2011 American Heart Association guidelines include gestational diabetes and HDP in assessments of vascular risk for cardiovascular disease in women. Studies show that the importance of monitoring vascular risk factors in these women after pregnancy is poorly understood by the women themselves and their physicians. Adoption of these health behaviors is low, although the American Diabetes Prevention Program trial showed that a prudent diet and a physically active lifestyle reduce the risk of diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes. Qualitative research confirms the need for specific strategies that address barriers and provide social support. More research is also needed on approaches to reduce vascular risk in women with a history of gestational diabetes and HDP. Otherwise, an early window of opportunity for chronic disease prevention in young, high-risk women will be missed.",0,0,

The 7.6 million deaths attributed to cancer in 2008 represent 13% of all deaths. It is estimated that around 30% of cancer deaths are due to the five leading behavioral and dietary risks. These include high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use. A number of viral infections such as hepatitis B and C and HPV are responsible for about 20% of cancer deaths. About 70% of cancer deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Due to the increasing number of elderly individuals and increased control of comorbidities, deaths from cancer are expected to continue to rise worldwide, with an estimated 13.1 million deaths in 2030. To meet this need, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is a truly international organization. More than a third of ASCO members work in more than 100 countries, representing the world's largest collection of expertise and insights into cancer treatment. More than half of ASCO's Annual Meeting attendees come from outside the United States. The Journal of Clinical Oncology is read by more than 24,000 subscribers worldwide and is available in a number of different languages. To fulfill its mission, ASCO has a number of international programs dedicated to sharing knowledge and providing the tools to assist clinicians around the world in treating their patients.

852,"Group cognitive behavioral therapy for initial psychosis: who is referred, who attends, and who completes?","OBJECTIVE: Most national guidelines recommend psychological therapy for people with first-stage psychosis (FEP), but interventions that have proven effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in research settings are not always effectively reflected in real-world clinical settings. In a limited healthcare system, it is important to understand the system and patient barriers to participation in effective treatment. We sought to determine which patient characteristics influenced clinicians' decision to apply or not to apply for group cognitive behavioral therapy for FEP, and which characteristics were associated with referrals who attended/not participated in the program and adhered to/not adhered to the program. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2008, all confirmed cases of FEP from a defined geographic area were reviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses. , Positive Symptoms Rating Scale, Negative Symptoms Rating Scale, Calgary Schizophrenia Depression Scale, and Birchwood Insight Scale. The duration of untreated psychosis was determined using the Beiser Scale. RESULTS: Of 124 people (77 men, 47 women) in the final sample, 88 (72%) were referred for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 52 (59%) attended and 12 (23%) did not complete CBT . Those with higher insight into treatment need (U = 740.00, z = -2.63, P = 0.008) and those with higher levels of positive symptoms (t (120) = -3.064, P = 0.003) were more likely to be referred was higher. to CBT.

CONCLUSION: In an early intervention service for FEP, individuals with less education, more negative symptoms, and less insight appear to experience significant barriers to successfully completing group CBT. More information for referring clinicians about the benefits of CBT for FEP can help increase referral rates. Ambitious benefits should also be considered for people at risk of leaving or not complying.",0,0,

INTERVENTIONS A manual-based developmental group therapy program specifically designed for self-harming adolescents, with an acute phase of six-week sessions followed by a supportive phase of weekly groups as needed. Details of routine care were collected from participating centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the frequency of subsequent recurrent episodes of self-harm. Secondary outcomes were severity of subsequent self-harm, mood disturbance, suicidal ideation, and general functioning. Total costs of health, social care, education and criminal justice sector services, as well as family-related costs and productivity losses were recorded. RESULTS 183 adolescents were allocated to each arm (total n = 366). Follow-up loss was low (<4%). In all results, the trial group as a whole showed significant improvement from baseline to follow-up. On the primary outcome of self-harm frequency, the proportional odds ratio of routine care adjustment versus group treatment for relevant baseline variables was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.44, P = 0.95) and 0.88 (0.59 to 1.33, P) at 6 months. = 0.52) in 1 year. Equivalent odds ratios for severity of subsequent self-harm were 0.81 (0.54 to 1.20, P = 0.29) at 6 months and 0.94 (0.63 to 1.40, P = 0.75) at 1 year. Total 1-year costs (£21,781) in the group therapy arm were higher than for routine care (£15,372), but the difference was not significant (95% CI -1416 to 10782, P = 0.132). CONCLUSIONS The addition of this targeted group therapy program did not improve self-harm outcomes for adolescents who repeatedly self-harmed, and there was no evidence of cost-effectiveness. Outcomes to endpoint for the cohort as a whole were better than current clinical expectations. Trial registration ISRCTN 20496110.",0,0,
854,Growth and nutritional risk in children with developmental delay,"INTRODUCTION: Nutritional risk influences outcome in developmental delay. The main objectives were to identify the incidence and factors contributing to the growth stagnation. METHODS: Clinical data review was completed for 500 developmentally delayed patients admitted to the Early Intervention service. Data were collected using a standardized parent nutritional screening checklist before and during the initial dietary assessment. Data were compared with nutritional assessment data, GOSH and FSAI dietary guidelines. Weight category was determined using RCPCH growth and BMI charts. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 (IBM Statistics 20.0). RESULTS: The nutritional risk was determined as 48.6%. Weight categories were growth arrest (13.5%), underweight (7.7%), overweight (8.4%) and obesity (4.3%) at initial assessment. Growth arrest was correlated with age <1 (p = 0.000) and gestational age (p = 0.017), with the highest rates (3.6%) in those born at 32-36 weeks. Weight category was associated with adding solids to the 17 weeks pre-recommendation (10.1%), with ANOVA showing significance (P = 0.013). In 22.7% of those evaluated, it was observed that the nutritional risk was not sufficiently recognized by the parents. Feeding difficulties were common: 4.2% were fed enterally, 7.7% were taking prescription nutritional supplements, 29.1% (n=121) had feeding difficulties, and 13.9% (n=58) were on behavioral nutrition. was having difficulties. Iron intake did not meet the recommended intake in 20.9% (n=87) and calcium 4.5% (n=19). The prevalence of constipation was 21.6 and 11.8% required medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Developmental delay predisposes to nutritional deficiencies that affect outcome. Screening, evaluation and timely interventions are warranted to prevent worse developmental outcomes.",0,0,
855,Adherence to guidelines in the management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the only leading cause of death with increasing morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for optimizing pharmacotherapy for patients with COPD have been updated based on the promising results of randomized clinical trials. We examined the frequency of physician adherence to the guidelines and associated factors in clinical practice at an academic medical center. METHODS: Patients clinically admitted to outpatient clinics with a clinical diagnosis of COPD confirmed by spirometry were included. The primary outcome was that the provider adhered to the 2007 Global Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Initiative (GOLD) guidelines. Subjects receiving a rescue inhaler (all patients) or at least one long-acting bronchodilator (stage II) or at least one long-acting bronchodilator plus one inhaled corticosteroid (stage III-IV) were categorized in accordance with the guideline. Demographics, clinical information, and provider type were recorded. Provider type was classified by both as primary care physician (PCP), pulmonologist, or co-management. RESULTS: Of the 450 subjects who met the study criteria, 246 (54.7%) received treatment in accordance with the guidelines. Age, gender, race, disease severity, and co-morbidities were not associated with compliance with the guideline. Multivariate analysis showed that patients co-managed by a PCP and pulmonologist were more likely to receive treatment in accordance with the guidelines than those managed by one or the other (Odds Ratio: 4.59"";"" 95% Confidence Interval: 2.92, 7.22, p < 0.001). ). CONCLUSIONS: Slightly more than half of stable COPD patients receive care in accordance with the guidelines. Co-management by a PCP and pulmonologist increases the likelihood of receiving guideline-compliant inhaler therapy.",0,0,
856,Guideline practice in allied health professions: a systematic review of the literature,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines aim to improve the safety and quality of patient care by providing clinicians with graded recommendations based on best practice evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of introducing clinical guidelines for allied health professionals and to estimate the effectiveness of guideline dissemination and implementation strategies used. METHODS: A comprehensive search of six electronic databases and the Cochrane Organization for Effective Implementation and Maintenance database was conducted up to June 2006. Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, pre- and post-controlled studies, and discontinuous time series studies were included if the intervention was aimed at applying guidelines in allied health professions. Articles were screened for relevance and their methodological quality evaluated"";"" data were extracted independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied greatly, with the ratio of quality criteria ranging from 0 to 6 out of seven. In most studies, reported effects for patient and process outcomes were small and favored the intervention group. Of the 14 included studies, 10 focused on educational interventions. Six of the 14 studies used a single intervention strategy and seven used a multi-pronged implementation strategy. One study compared both single and multiple strategies. Multiple interventions were no more effective than single intervention strategies, and the effects of the same strategy differed between trials. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support an established guideline implementation strategy for allied health professionals. When applying clinical guidelines, it is important to first identify specific barriers to change using theoretical frameworks of behavior change and then develop strategies that deal with these barriers. When measuring the effectiveness of these strategies, professionals should consider the use of both patient and process outcomes and select outcomes that reflect their goals.",0,1,
857,Application of the guide: what the literature does not tell us,"BACKGROUND: Despite the large number of studies and literature reviews regarding the application of guidelines, it remains unclear whether and how clinical guidelines can be used to improve the quality of medical care. This study sought to find out if these studies and reviews recognized the importance of systems thinking and organizational change for practice. METHODS: A literature review was conducted for systematic reviews of guideline implementation or practice improvement studies. Each review is examined in terms of the extent to which it describes or discusses the value of system changes, organizational support, applied environmental factors, and use of a change process. RESULTS: Forty-seven quality systematic reviews were found. They largely agreed that using reminders and perhaps feedback during clinical encounters were the most effective ways to implement guidelines. However, the same reviews rarely identified these strategies as system changes, and there was little discussion of the need for institutional support or attention to the various environmental variables that could affect implementation. The change process required to introduce a new or modified delivery system received even less attention. CONCLUSION: Reviews of guideline practice trials have focused on how to change the behavior of individual clinicians. Little attention has been paid to the impact of practice systems or the organizational support of clinician behavior, the role of the practice environmental context in which change is produced, or in which change is attempted. A renewed interest in these issues can help us better understand and undertake the process of improving medical care delivery.",0,1,

859,Guideline-based early rehabilitation after myocardial infarction. A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of individualized educational behavioral therapy delivered by cardiac nurses in hospital compared to usual care for patients after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. Outcome assessment was done by self-report questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Dartmouth COOP Health Status), interview at month 1, and self-report at month 3 and 12. The primary outcome was improvement in Dartmouth COOP overall score from baseline to 3 months. RESULTS: Four patients required treatment (number required to treat [NNT] 4, 95% confidence interval [CIs] 3 to 12) to give an additional patient with improved health at 3 months. The intervention group was more confident in returning to activities 1 month after hospital discharge. Treated patients needed less treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized educational behavioral therapy administered in hospital by cardiac nurses can have significant benefits. A large-scale pragmatic RCT is needed.",0,0,
860,Guidelines and educational visits from community pharmacists to improve prescribing in general practice: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of guidelines with or without one-on-one educational outreach visits by community pharmacists in developing general practice prescription for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: Cluster randomized study of 20 general practices in Avon, UK. Apps were randomly divided into three groups: control""; mailed instructions;"" posted guidelines plus educational access visits. General practitioners (GPs) in the second group received two one-on-one outreach visits from community pharmacists. Changes in prescribing were measured using results from prescribing analysis and cost (PACT) data. The primary outcome measure was change in prescribing volume for ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen as a percentage of total NSAID prescribing. Six secondary outcomes included other measures of prescribing quality and volume. Cost-benefit analysis was done. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for the primary outcome measure: apps that received outreach visits only had 2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8 to 5.0] of the three recommended NSAIDs, more than control treatments, and 1.6% predicted (95% CI: -1.4 to 4.7) more than just apps that received the instructions. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, only one secondary outcome showed a statistically significant difference between groups: the prescription rate for the five most commonly used drugs was 2.2% (95% CI: 0.9 to 3.6) higher in the education outreach group than in the others. control group. Both interventions showed a net increase in costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although initial good prescribing in participatory practice limits the capacity to improve, this trial provides no evidence that guidelines with or without educational access visits from community pharmacists lead to significant improvements in prescribing behavior.",0,0,
861,Principles and psychology of medical decision-making in the treatment of depressive disorders,"Guidelines aim to improve medical decision making. Guidelines seek to influence medical behavior, unlike textbooks and reviews that seek to improve medical knowledge. Scientific models of medical decision-making, such as action theory, and empirical data on the effects of guidelines suggest that guidelines do not always achieve their goals, and may even impair medical quality. The problem of guidelines in medicine is discussed with reference to depressive disorders. However, these issues apply to medicine as a whole. Therefore, whether physicians exposed to the guideline achieve better outcomes with their patients should be tested in controlled clinical trials. Only such guidelines should be named based on empirical evidence of positive effects.",0,0,
862,Guidelines as rationing tools: a qualitative analysis of psychosocial patient selection criteria for cardiac procedures.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac procedure guidelines often include psychosocial criteria for selecting patients who potentially incorporate social value judgments in clinical decisions and decisions regarding the allocation of care. The purpose of this study was to explore the terms, rationales, and meanings of psychosocial patient characteristics used in cardiac procedure guidelines. METHODS: We selected English manuals published since 1990 and chapters from textbooks published since 1989. These guidelines combined multiple sources of evidence and expertise and made recommendations for patient selection for specific procedures. A multidisciplinary team of doctors and social scientists deduced passages on psychosocial criteria and developed categories and conceptual relationships to describe and interpret their content. RESULTS: Sixty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. Forty-five (69%) mentioned psychosocial criteria as an indication or contraindication for the procedure. Second, behavioral and psychological issues are divided into several categories, including relationships with significant other, financial resources, social roles, and environmental conditions. COMMENT: Psychosocial characteristics are portrayed as having 2 roles in patient selection: candidate-specific risk factors or indicators of the need for special intervention. Guidelines typically list psychosocial contraindications without explaining their specific nature or providing any justification for their use. Psychosocial considerations may help evaluate patients for cardiac procedures, but they become ethically controversial when used to restrict access. The use of psychosocial indications and contraindications can be improved by more precise definitions of the psychosocial problem in question, explanations as to why the criterion is important, and justification of the trait using a biological rationale or research evidence.",0,0,
863,Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services: GAPS in Practice,"DESIGN: Comparison of results obtained through chart control, before and after Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS). SETTING: A rural hospital-based general pediatrics clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents undergoing annual examination between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 2001. A random sample of 441 medical records were reviewed. INTERVENTION: Training and use of the questionnaire in the GAPS model began in April 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identifying, discussing, and referencing GAPS-related risk behavior. RESULTS: The medical records of 162 young adolescents (ages 11-15) and 279 older adolescents (16-19 years) were audited. Detection of risky behaviors increased from 19% at baseline to 95% with initial GAPS and 87% with periodic GAPS. The most common risk factor was possession of a rifle or handgun at home (young adolescents, 47% and older adolescents, 39%). The mean number of documented risk behaviors and health concerns was higher in the initial GAPS (4.8 and 1.3, respectively) than in the periodic GAPS (3.8 and 0.7) (P =.01 and .006). GAPS surveys detected lower levels of risk behavior compared with a local Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Control for gender, age and clinician, discussion of psychosocial issues increased during the study period"";"" however, there were significant differences among clinicians regarding the issues addressed. The GAPS-related referral rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The GAPS model increases clinicians' identification and discussion of risky behaviors.",0,0,
864,Guidelines for assessing postpartum issues: presenting evidence-based guidelines in Australian general practice,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum morbidity is high and many GPs lack the confidence and knowledge to deal with common postpartum problems. There is a high consultation rate, but few women disclose common health issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to increase the knowledge and skills of general practitioners in identifying and managing common health problems experienced by women in the year following birth. METHODS: A training program [Guidelines for Evaluation of Postpartum Problems (GAPP)] embedded in a large randomized community intervention study [Resources, Information and Support Program for Mothers (PRISM)], pre/post evaluation by Australian GPs working in Australia . four metropolitan and four rural communities. The program consisted of supervision, interactive workshops, role-playing and evidence-based guidelines and was assessed at baseline and at 6 months through written questionnaires and a surgical consultation with a trained simulated patient evaluator. RESULTS: A total of 68 (86%) practitioners took part in the full GAPP program. The probability of developing a GP's knowledge items ranged from 1.0 to 16, with the greatest change occurring in knowledge about the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for maternal depression. The percentage of GPs who gave false answers at baseline, who showed improved knowledge at follow-up, ranged from 22% to 100%. About half of GPs initially demonstrated excellent communication skills. More than half of the remaining GPs demonstrated greatly improved skills in detecting common postpartum problems at follow-up. At the initial simulated patient visit, 70% of GPs questioned sexual problems and none questioned the possibility of abuse, while at follow-up 94% questioned sexual problems and 51.5% facilitated the explanation of physical and emotional abuse. Anonymous feedback from GPs participating in the program showed that 89% believed the program had positively impacted their actual practice. Interestingly, GPs demonstrated greater knowledge and skill in the simulated setting than in the written questionnaire. CONCLUSION: This relatively short, well-rounded training program has helped many participants develop the knowledge and skills necessary to improve both physical and emotional health after birth. Despite being experienced clinicians and actively participating in a program on interviewing skills, half of the GPs did not facilitate disclosure of the underlying sensitive issue (abuse) during the follow-up consultation and could benefit from more in-depth training in effective communication skills.",0,0,
865,"Family-Centered Care Guide in Neonatal, Pediatric and Adult Intensive Care Unit","OBJECTIVE: To provide clinicians with evidence-based strategies to optimize support for critically ill families in the ICU. METHODS: We used Council of Medical Specialty Societies principles for the development of clinical guidelines as the guideline development framework. We assembled an international multidisciplinary team of 29 with expertise in guideline development, evidence analysis and family-centered care to revise the 2007 Clinical Practice Guidelines to support the family in the patient-centered intensive care unit. We conducted a scoping review of qualitative studies investigating family-centered care in the intensive care unit. Thematic analyzes were conducted to support population, intervention, comparison, and outcome question development. Patients and their families reaffirmed the importance of interventions and outcomes. We then conducted a systematic review using the Rating of Recommendations, Evaluation, Development and Evaluation methodology to make recommendations for implementation. Proposals were subjected to electronic voting with predetermined voting thresholds. No industry funding has been associated with guideline development. RESULTS: Scoping review yielded 683 qualitative studies""; 228 were used for thematic analysis and Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome question development. Systematic review research yielded 4,158 reports after deduplication and 76 additional studies from alerts and hand searches were added;"" 238 studies met the inclusion criteria. We made 23 recommendations from moderate, low, and very low evidence on communication with family members, family presence, family support, consultations, and operational and environmental issues with ICU team members. We provide recommendations for future research and study tools to support the translation of recommendations into practice. CONCLUSIONS: This guideline describes the evidence base for best practices for family-centered care in the intensive care unit. All recommendations were weak, highlighting the relative emergence of this research area and the importance of future research to identify the most effective interventions to improve this important aspect of ICU care.",0,0,
866,Guidelines for entering and staying in care and improving antiretroviral compliance for people with HIV: evidence-based recommendations from the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care.,"DESCRIPTION: After diagnosis of HIV, timely entry and retention in HIV medical care is essential to the delivery of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence to ART is among the key determinants of successful HIV treatment outcome and is essential for minimizing the emergence of drug resistance. The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care convened a panel to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimizing care admission and retention and adherence to ART for people with HIV. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to establish a limited evidence base, with randomized, controlled trials and observational studies with comparators with at least 1 measured biological or behavioral endpoint. A total of 325 studies met the criteria. Two reviewers extracted and coded data independently from each study using a standardized data extraction form. Panel members outlined evidence-based recommendations for each method or intervention and then rated the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of each recommendation. RECOMMENDATIONS: Provides recommendations for monitoring entry and stay, interventions to improve entry and care, and monitoring and interventions to improve adherence to ART. Recommendations include ART strategies, compliance tools, education and counseling, and health system and service delivery interventions. It also covers specific topics related to pregnant women, incarcerated individuals, the homeless and marginally placed individuals, children and adolescents, and substance use and mental health disorders.

Therefore, the treatment team was given three to five guidelines on how to deal with the patient, and the patient was shown with possible true statements. The guidelines aimed at a general interactive approach to the patient and did not specify specific therapeutic interventions. They were founded following the principles of Brief Therapy developed at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto. The results of our intervention in the treatment of ten patients are reported. The therapeutic team rated the guidelines generally positively. The therapeutic outcome has varied greatly. A comparison with a matched-pair control group showed a positive trend.

869,Apallik Syndrome / A Guide to Quality Management in Vegetative Condition,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiology in Europe shows steadily increasing numbers for apallic syndrome (AS)/vegetative state (VS) as a result of enabling high-standard home nursing for enhanced recovery, emergency services, intensive care treatment after acute brain injury and fully dependent end. - cases secondary to progressive neurological disease. The management of patients with irreversible persistent AS/VS has been the subject of continuous scientific and moral-legal debate over the past decade. METHODS: A task force on AS/VS quality management guidelines was established under the auspices of the European Federation of Neurological Societies Scientific Panel Neurotraumatology to address key issues regarding AS/VS prevalence and quality management. The collection and analysis of scientific data on class II (III) evidence from the literature and best practice-based recommendations resulting from the expertise of task force members comply with EFNS Guidance regulations. RESULTS: The overall incidence of new AS/VS full-stage cases of all etiology is 0.5-2/100,000 population per year. About one-third are traumatic and two-thirds non-traumatic. Increasing numbers have been noticed for hypoxic brain injury and progressive neurological disease. The main conceptual criticism is based on the evaluation and diagnosis of all the different stages of AS/VS based solely on behavioral findings, without knowing the precise or uniform pathogenesis or the uncertainty of clinical evaluation due to neuropathological findings and varying inclusion criteria. No specific diagnosis or specific medical treatment can be recommended for the treatment and rehabilitation of Class II or III AS. Therefore, the essential diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the clinical features of AS/VS patients with ""AS complete, remission, defect, and end-stages"" require more professional training and expertise for physicians and rehabilitation personnel. COMMENT: The management of AS aims at social reintegration of patients or has to guarantee humane active nursing if treatment fails. The outcome depends on the cause and duration of AS/VS as well as the age of the patient. There is no single AS/VS-specific laboratory study, regimen, or stimulant intervention to recommend to improve higher cerebral functioning. Quality management requires a minimum of 3 years of further education and permanent training to qualify for AS/VS treatment and specialization. Indispensable areas covering AS/VS institutions are required for early and long-term rehabilitation on a population basis (2/100,000/year) to accelerate functional restoration and prevent or treat complications. Nursing homes are needed for respectful humane nursing, including basal sensor-motor stimulation techniques. Passive euthanasia is considered an act of mercy by physicians in terms of stopping treatment"";"" however, the ethical and legal issues associated with cessation of nutrition and hydration and end-of-life discussions raise deep concerns. The guide is intended for neurologists, neurosurgeons, other physicians working with AS/VS patients, neurorehabilitation personnel, patients, relatives, and health authorities.",0,0,
870,Guidelines for reporting health interventions using mobile phones: mobile health (mHealth) evidence reporting and evaluation (mERA) checklist,"To improve the completeness of reporting of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, the WHO mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group developed the mHealth evidence reporting and evaluation (mERA) checklist. The development process for MERA consisted of bringing together a group of experts to recommend an appropriate approach, establishing a global expert review panel for checklist development, and pilot testing the checklist. The guiding principle for the development of these criteria is to identify, support and support the minimum set of information required to define what an mHealth intervention is (content), where it is implemented (context), and how it is implemented (technical specifications). repetition of the intervention. This document provides the resulting 16-item checklist and detailed explanation and elaboration for each item, with examples of illustrative reporting. With widespread adoption, we expect the use of these guidelines to standardize the quality of mHealth evidence reporting and indirectly improve the quality of mHealth evidence. #### Summary points Mobile technologies have the potential to bridge the systemic gaps needed to improve access to and use of healthcare services, particularly among underserved communities.

OBJECTIVES: To identify and evaluate the impact of efforts to introduce clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visiting), midwifery, and other medical-related professions. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of the Care Group expert registry, MEDLINE (1975 to 1996), EMBASE, Cinahl and Sigle 1996, NHS Database of Economic Assessments (1994 to 1996), DHSS-Data (1983 to 1996), Efficacy Reviews Database of Abstracts (1994 - 1996) and reference lists of articles. We also manually searched Quality at Health Care, made personal contact with content experts, and contacted libraries identified by an expert panel. SELECTION CRITERIA: Discrete time-series analyzes of randomized trials, controlled pre- and post-controlled studies, and introduction of interventions 1. Clinical guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus non-guidelines""; 2. Guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus guidelines plus alternative Standard physician care versus dissemination and/or implementation strategies and guidelines used by 3. (post hoc) medicine-related professions Participants were nurses, midwives, and other medical-related professions DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently derived data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving more than 467 health care professionals were included.Reporting of study methods was inadequate for all studies.All but one study had nurses as the targeted professional group, one study targeted dietitians only. r included the management of hypertension, low back pain, and hyperlipidemia. Nine studies were identified for comparison 1. Three out of five studies observed improvements in at least some care process, and six out of eight studies observed improvements in care outcomes. Only one study included a formal economic assessment with uncertain findings. Three studies were identified for Comparison 2, but it was difficult to draw firm conclusions due to poor methods. Six studies were identified for Comparison 3 (post hoc). These studies generally supported the hypothesis that there is no difference between the care provided by nurses using clinical guidelines and standard physician care. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that guide-based care is effective in changing the course and outcome of care provided by the medical-related professions. However, care needs to be taken when generalizing the findings to other professions and settings.",0,1,
873,Guidelines for smoking management in the perioperative period,"Smoking is a particularly important public health problem in the perioperative period, as it exposes patients scheduled for surgery to a 20% increased risk of hospital mortality and a 40% increased risk of major postoperative complications. In addition, current smoking increases almost all specific surgical complications. The perioperative period provides a real opportunity to quit smoking. By offering behavioral management and prescribing nicotine replacement before any planned surgical intervention, the rate of preoperative smoking cessation can be significantly increased. Preoperative smoking cessation should be routinely recommended regardless of the time of intervention, although the benefits increase with cessation time. All professionals of the care pathway (general practitioners, surgeons, anesthetists-intensity specialists, caregivers) should inform smokers of the positive effects of smoking cessation and offer them tailored management and personalized follow-up. In children, it is essential to quit parental smoking or remove the child from environmental tobacco smoke as long as possible before surgery.",0,0,
874,"Guidelines, editors, drug and biological paradigm shift","Private investment in biomedical research has increased over the past few decades. In many places it was hailed as the next best thing to technology itself. Many of the intellectual talents from academic institutions are absorbed into lucrative positions in the industry. Applied research finds willing collaborators in the venture-capital-funded industry, thus ensuring symbiotic growth for both. There are also significant costs involved. As academia interacts with industry, major areas of conflict of interest have emerged that apply specifically to biomedical research. These relate to disputes over patents and copyrights, hostile confrontations between academia and industry, as well as between public and private enterprise, legal entanglements, research abuses of various kinds, lobbies of oppositional media and patient advocates, and a general atmosphere of convergence of business interests. priority over patient welfare. The pharmacy image stinks due to a series of omissions and commission errors. A recent example is the suppression of negative findings about the marketing maneuvers of Bayer's Trasylol (Aprotinin) and Eli Lilly's Xigris (rhAPC). When there is a conflict between patient vulnerability and profit motives, medicine often tends towards the latter. There is also documentation that illuminates how companies often cross the line between patient well-being and profit-seeking behavior. A voluntary moratorium on drug spending is required to indulge drug prescribers. A code of conduct recently adopted by OPPI in India to limit pharmaceutical company spending on junk and junk is a welcome step. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are considered important as they guide the diagnosis/treatment regimen of many medical professionals and hospitals. and makes recommendations about drugs, their dosage and selection criteria. Besides clinical trials, it is a growing area of influence by the pharmaceutical industry. For example, a relatively recent 2002 study found that approximately 60% of the 192 authors of clinical practice guidelines reported having financial ties to companies being considered drugs. There is a strong case for making CPGs based not only on effectiveness but also on cost effectiveness. The various consequences of this should be explained. Evaluation of the Guidelines The work of bodies such as Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Collaboration and the Guidelines Advisory Committee (GAC) is also worth watching closely. Even the actions of Foundations working to cure diseases have come under scrutiny. The process of creating 'Best Practices' Guidelines for interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and clinicians has already begun and could have important implications for patient care. Similarly, Good Publication Practice (GPP) for pharmaceutical companies aimed to improve the behavior of pharmaceutical companies when reporting drug trials. The rapidly increasing trend towards influence and control by industry has become a concern for many. It is so important that the Association of American Medical Colleges has published two relatively recent papers - one on ""how to deal with conflicts of individual interest"" in 2001 and the other on how to handle institutional conflicts in 2002. Concerned with the conduct of clinical research. AMCs), like medical education and research institutions elsewhere, must adopt tools that minimize conflicts of interest. Both medical societies and research journal editors have institutional conflicts of interest in the conduct of individual and clinical trials, and documents that address these issues are now available. The ICMJE revision requires full disclosure of the sponsor's role in research, as well as ensuring that researchers are independent of the sponsor. Responsible for the design and conduct of the trial, having independent access to all research data, and controlling all editorial and publication decisions. The findings of one study indicate that academic institutions routinely participate in clinical research that does not meet the ICMJE standards for accountability, data access, and publication control. profitability of the industry and research is giving rise to academia. The industry supports new rather than traditional treatments, regardless of what is effective. Whichever traditional therapy is supported, it's likely because the company involved has a product that has a large stake in it, remains the 'gold standard', or that the player thinks still has some 'juice' left. Industry sponsorship is mainly for potential drugs, not to try to determine if there are non-pharmacological interventions that could be equally good, if not better. In the paradigm shift to biological psychiatry, the role of industry sponsorship is not overt, but probably more pervasive than many realize, or one might think that thinking right is good for the health of the branch in the long run. protecting the interests of research subjects. Patients agree to be the subject of research not only for personal medical benefit, but also as an extension to benefit the rest of the patient population and also to advance medical research. The pharmaceutical industry is huge. However, we must also recognize that there is a fundamental difference between marketing strategies for other organizations and those for drugs. The ultimate barometer is patient well-being, and no drug that doesn't compromise it will stand the test of time. So how does it make commercial sense to market substandard products in the long run? The biggest mistake long-term players in the industry can make is trying to adopt the dark techniques of beginners. Secrecy of marketing/sales tactics, production process, other business expansion strategies and plans, anti-competitive strategies are good business tactics. However, it is crucial that confidentiality as a tactic does not specifically include reporting of research findings that are contrary to the individual's product. Farma has no choice but to make a quality product, make extensive adverse reaction profiles and only market it if it passes both tests. .Why does the drug adopt dubious tactics? The reasons are actually two: With all the restrictions, a medicine comes to the pharmacy after big investments. There are serious overheads and infrastructure costs that need to be recovered. And they have huge profit margins to protect. If they only depended on real drug discoveries, that would be taking a huge risk. Industry players need to strike the right balance between profitability and reliability. Marketing champions play their role in making a profit. In credibility ratings, researchers and paid spokespersons play their roles. Everything is ridiculous until marketing is based on credibility. When there is nothing that can be done for credibility, one thing is envisioned and marketed as one, with the calculated hope that profits can accrue, as profit making must continue indefinitely. This is what makes pharmacy adopt even questionable ways to make a profit. There are basically four types of drugs. First, drugs that work and have minimal side effects; second, drugs that work but have serious side effects; third, drugs that do not work and have minimal side effects, and fourth, drugs that work minimally but have serious side effects. It is the second and fourth types that create great difficulties for the industry. Often the industry can try to project. The fourth type is the second type to evade censorship. The biggest game of cat and mouse played by conscientious researchers is to reveal what the third and fourth are and not let the industry hunt them down as the first and second type respectively. The main game is to prevent the second kind from being projected as the first. The third kind is essentially harmless, so they attract reprimand and some fun to market them. But they escape nothing more than a smack on the knuckles. What is needed for industry captains and long-term players is this: Their main driving force is simply can produce the first type 2. accept the second type. only until you can get your hands on the first one. 3. The third type can be played occasionally to supplement profits, but never by projecting them as the first type. 4. The fourth type is the laggards, they are a real threat to credibility and therefore do not deserve any market excitement or promotion. While we find out why most drugs indulge in dubious tactics, we are guided to some interesting solutions to avoid such tactics in the least amount. Difficulties for everyone involved, even if both profit and reliability are kept intact.",0,0,
875,Guideline-based indicators to measure the quality of prenatal care,"RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive measure of the quality of antenatal care is not available. A late booking or low number of checks is often used as a proxy for poor quality, leaving uncertainty about the true content of care received. To fill this gap, we reviewed two sets of clinical guidelines and developed corresponding quality indicators. METHOD: A group of clinicians and methodologists reviewed the National Institute of Clinical Excellence Clinical Guidelines on prenatal care and the list of prenatal care interventions recommended by the Research and Development Group, both based on evidence for the effectiveness of specific interventions. We identified one direction in three areas: (1) service use""; (2) screening; and (3) interventions. For each indicator, we defined: (1) eligibility, ie the characteristics of women to whom the indicator was applied; (2) the standard, i.e. the state when the goal was achieved; "" and (3) moderators, ie any conditions that legitimately prevent the standard from being fulfilled. RESULTS: We developed four indicators for service usage, 25 scans and 17 interventions. For each indicator, the relevant eligibility, standard and moderator criteria are explained. While many indicators from medical charts can be evaluated retrospectively, the quality of communication with the provider, screening for sensible issues, and counseling on behaviors to avoid can only be obtained through prospective data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Quality indicators of prenatal care, complemented by measures of social position, social support, and immigrant/ethnic status, allow for careful identification of gaps in quality of care for specific groups of women.",0,0,
876,Withdrawal of Antipsychotic Use in Long-Term Care (HALT): A single-arm longitudinal study aimed at reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use in long-term care residents with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications to manage Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) persists despite revised guidelines and evidence of associated risks and side effects. The purpose of the Halt Antipsychotic Use in Long-Term Care (HALT) project is to identify residents of long-term care (LTC) facilities associated with antipsychotic drugs and to take an intervention to discontinue (or stop) their prescriptions and cure non-pharmacological drugs. behavior management. METHODS: LTC facilities will be recruited across Sydney, Australia. Resident inclusion criteria would be over 60 years of age, on regular antipsychotic medication and without primary psychotic illness or very severe BPSD, as measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Data collection will be done one month and one week before the start of the removal of the prescription"";"" and after 3, 6 and 12 months. In the pre-prescription period, care staff will be trained on how to reduce and manage BPSD using person-centered approaches, and academic elaboration will be provided to participants' general practitioners. The primary outcome measure will be the reduction of regular antipsychotic medications without the use of substitute psychotropic drugs. Secondary outcome measures would be total NPI and area scores, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores, and adverse events, including falls and hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Although previous studies have identified strategies to minimize the inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs in people with dementia living in long-term care, sustainability and prescribing culture for BPSD in aged care remain challenges. The HALT project aims to evaluate the feasibility of a multidisciplinary approach for prescribing antipsychotics in this population.",0,0,

882,"Health information, behavior change and decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes: developing a personalized, preference-sensitive health communication application","OBJECTIVE: Patient participation in diabetes management, such as joint decision making and patient self-management, has important effects on clinical parameters. As a precondition for active participation, patients need to be informed adequately and sensitive to preferences. Combining web-based health information for patients with additional support, Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCA) offer the opportunity to reach large numbers of patients at low cost and provide them with high-quality information and support in time, place and learning speed. they prefer. Still, web-based interventions often suffer from high attrition. Tailoring the intervention to patients' needs and preferences should reduce attrition and therefore increase effectiveness. The aim of this study was to develop a custom IHCA that provides evidence-based, preference-sensitive content and treatment decision support to patients with type 2 diabetes. The content was developed based on a needs assessment and two evidence-based treatment guidelines. The delivery format is a conversational, tunneled design that adapts the content and tone of the dialogue to relevant patient characteristics (health literacy, attitudes towards self-care, and psychological barriers to insulin therapy). Both the content and the adaptation were revised by an interdisciplinary advisory committee. CONCLUSION: The World Wide Web has great potential for patient information and self-management interventions. Through the development and evaluation of a dedicated IHCA, we complement patients' face-to-face meetings with their healthcare practitioners and make them more productive and satisfying for both parties. The effects of the app are currently being tested in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,
883,"Health literacy training for public health nurses in Fukushima: a case study of program adaptation, implementation and evaluation.","Health literacy includes not only an individual's ability to access, understand and use health information, but also the ability of healthcare providers to make health information accessible and usable. The Fukushima nuclear accident posed difficulties with the transmission of radiation-related health information. Public health nurses are the caretakers of community health in Japan and have a primary responsibility for communicating this complex information about science and risk to ordinary members of the community. A health literacy education program was designed to increase the communication skills of participating nurses with two key objectives: changing communication practices and norms among public health nurses and improving access to information for community residents. The training content included an overview of health literacy skills (including numbers), processes for evaluating written materials and visual representations, and guidelines for text improvement. The workshop was spread over two days with two-hour sessions each day. A proximal post-training assessment questionnaire was conducted, followed by a more distant monthly follow-up assessment to assess practical application of skills learned. Twenty-six nurses from Fukushima City attended the first hearing. Post-training evaluations were very positive, with 85-100% of participants agreeing on the relevance and usefulness of the workshop. During the one-month follow-up, the nurses reported applying new knowledge and skills to develop written materials. However, they faced difficulties in sharing their new skills with their colleagues and changing their work norms. Participants also faced difficulties in using graphs and explaining risks in practice. This article highlights the importance of providing health literacy training opportunities to professionals to strengthen the health system's access to accessible information and services. This program also serves as an important reference for future disaster management efforts.",0,0,
884,Attitudes of healthcare professionals towards the treatment of acute diarrhea,"BACKGROUND: Traveler's diarrhea is the most common health problem in international travellers and is responsible for many consultations abroad and on the way home. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to 542 GPs, nurses, and pharmacists assessing attitudes towards the treatment and management of travel-related and non-travel-related diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals' attitudes towards the management of acute diarrhea vary and there are marked differences in adherence to published ""good practice"" guidelines and recommendations. Inconsistencies exist in stated attitudes and actual prescribing behavior towards prescribing antispasmodics and antimotility agents. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatment guidelines may be outdated. Inappropriate or delayed treatment puts the patient at a disadvantage. Limiting the use of antidiarrheal agents may prevent access to a drug that can shorten symptomatology and morbidity for those suffering from diarrhea and accelerate return to normalcy. Revision of guidelines for the management of diarrhea in adults has been delayed, as has standardization of treatment response.

885,Health promotion in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors: activating compliance in a multifaceted risk profile.,"With increasing cure rates of childhood cancer, the chances of nurse practitioners to encounter a large cohort of survivors in practice have increased. Various late effects programs are available"";"" however, funding for these programs is limited and not accessible to all patients. Primary providers can increasingly serve as a medical home for childhood cancer survivors (CCS). Understanding the inherent risks of cytotoxic therapy and the progressive consequences of late effects is vital to limit morbidity and mortality. Adolescents and young adults (AYA) who survive are particularly susceptible to making health behavior decisions that put them at risk for comorbidities. Developmentally appropriate experimentation with drug, alcohol or tobacco use and increased ultraviolet light exposure intensifies the risk of secondary malignancies and new diseases. The inadequacy of evidence-based surveillance guidelines and survivor-specific health promotion programs cumulatively widens the gap in non-compliance and misinformation.

It explores emerging health promotion techniques and the role of nurse practitioners in advancing health care, as well as health practices within the AFA survivor population.",0,0,
886,Health systems guidance assessment – a critical interpretative synthesis,"Background Health systems guidance (HSG) are systematically developed statements that assist decisions about options for addressing health system challenges, including relevant changes in health systems regulations. However, the development, evaluation, and reporting of HSG presents unique conceptual and methodological challenges regarding the various types of evidence involved, the complexity of health systems, and the preponderance of contextual factors. To fill this gap, we are conducting a research program that aims to create a tool to support HSG evaluation and to further improve HSG development and reporting. The focus of this article was to conduct a knowledge synthesis of the published and gray literature to identify quality criteria (concepts) related to this process. Methods We applied a critical interpretative synthesis (CIS) approach to knowledge synthesis that enables an iterative, flexible and dynamic analysis of various literatures to generate a candidate concept list that will form key components of the HSG tool. Using our review questions as a compass, we were able to guide the search strategy to search for articles based on their potential relevance to HSG evaluation, development and reporting. The search strategy included various electronic databases and resources, subject-specific journals, conference abstracts, research reports, book chapters, unpublished data, dissertations, and policy documents. Scanning of papers and data extraction was completed independently and in duplicate, and a narrative approach to data synthesis was applied. Results We identified 43 articles that met the eligibility criteria. No existing review on this topic was found and no HSG assessment tool was defined. More than one-third of the authors implicitly or explicitly identified the need for a high-quality tool aimed at systematically evaluating HSG and contributing to its development/reporting. We identified 30 concepts that may be relevant to the assessment of HSG and were able to group them into three meaningful areas: process principles, content and context principles. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the role that quality criteria play in the development, evaluation and reporting of HSG and demonstrated the resonance and interrelationship within and between various concepts in the three domains.",0,0,

889,Hand decontamination practices of healthcare workers: compliance with recommended guidelines,"OBJECTIVE: This article reports a study on handwashing/hand hygiene practices of healthcare workers from a behavioral perspective. BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infection poses a very real and serious threat to all hospital admissions. Pathogens are easily transmitted to the hands of healthcare workers, and hand hygiene significantly reduces this contamination. Evidence-based guidelines exist for HCWs to practice hand hygiene, but compliance is low internationally. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design with a suitable sample was used. Prejudicing, Reinforcing and Facilitating Structures in Educational Diagnosis and Evaluation Health Education Theory was used as the theoretical framework and the data were collected in 2001. Handwashing practices (behavior observation, n=314) and dispositions (attitude, (questionnaire, n=62) beliefs and knowledge of healthcare professionals to comply with hand hygiene rules were examined. Nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and nurses who directly care for patients in the study unit) care assistants participated. The interventional hand hygiene program aimed to prepare HCWs to adopt hand hygiene behavior (poster campaign and educational brochure), reinforce (feedback on pretest results), and activate behavior (providing alcohol hand rub near each patient's bed). Implementation of a multifaceted interventional behavioral hand hygiene program resulted in an overall improvement in adherence to hand hygiene guidelines (51-83%, P < 0.001), and HCWs believed that their skin condition had improved (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve compliance with handwashing guidelines to be effective It should be versatile. Alcoholic hand lotions (with emollients) should be provided at the bedside of each patient. The issues surrounding skin irritation by healthcare professionals need to be addressed urgently.",1,1,
890,Self-reported impact of an intervention program on healthcare workers' knowledge and behavior regarding infection control,"INTRODUCTION: Adherence to infection control guidelines is low and various efforts have been made to improve the performance of infection control measures by healthcare professionals. This study describes the performance and evaluation of a hospital-wide infection control program. The most important measure was the distribution of an infection control bulletin. METHODS: In the evaluation of the program, a questionnaire was administered to a randomly selected health worker to investigate the extent to which the health workers were aware of the program and whether they reported behavior change and renewed information as a result of the program. RESULTS: The intervention made it possible to reach >80% of staff in a Norwegian university hospital. Of those who actually read the Infection Control Bulletin, 92.9% reported that their knowledge was renewed and 60.6% reported a change in behavior. CONCLUSION: The intervention had a significant impact on nurses' and nurse assistants' knowledge and behavioral reports on infection control. Our study supports the importance of a long-term and multimodal approach to healthcare professionals in infection control studies. The time and resources spent preparing and distributing the Infection Control Bulletin was an effective way to reach large numbers of healthcare professionals.",0,0,

DESIGN Mendelian randomization study to test for causal effects of differences in height and BMI on five measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian randomization takes advantage of the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at the time of fertilization and thus are not confused with non-genetic factors. SET UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS 119,669 men and women of British descent aged 37 to 73. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Completed full-time education, degree-level education, occupation class, annual household income, and Townsend deprivation index. RESULTS In the UK Biobank study, shorter stature and higher BMI were observationally associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status. Associations between shorter stature and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in males, and associations between high BMI and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in females. For example, a BMI of 1 standard deviation (SD) higher was associated with €210 (£276""; $300; 95% confidence interval -84 to £420; P. =6 Ãƒâ€” 10(-3)) higher in men lower annual household income and annual household income in women with lower annual household income of Ã‚Â1890 (£1680 to £2100; P=6 Ãƒâ€” 10(-15)) Genetic analysis provided evidence that these associations are partially causal. Genetically determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) taller height resulted in a 0.06 (0.02 to 0.09) higher age at completing full-time education (P=0.01), 1.12 probability of working in a skilled occupation (1 .07 - 1.18) times higher (P=6 - 10(-7)) and € 1130 (£680 - £1580) higher annual household income (P=4 µ 10(-8)) Male relationships was stronger. Genetically determined 1 SD caused higher BMI (4.6 kg/m(2)) Ã€2940 (Â€) Â£1680 - £4200;” P=1 Ãƒâ€” 10(-5)) lower annual household income and 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16) SD (P=0.001) higher levels of deprivation in women only. CONCLUSIONS These data support the evidence that various aspects of a person's socioeconomic status, particularly women's BMI for income and deprivation, and height and BMI play an important partial role in determining men's height for education, income, and work class. These findings have important social and health implications and support the evidence that overweight people, especially women, are at a disadvantage and taller people, especially men, are advantageous.",0,0,
894,Helicobacter pylori management: how to improve therapeutic confusion in practice,"There appears to be a disconnect between current guidelines for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment and clinical practice, including physician beliefs and actual prescribing patterns. In particular, there are markedly different approaches to primary and secondary care and country-specific differences in eradication therapy for H pylori infection. Although most doctors do not believe that H pylori causes non-ulcer dyspepsia, the majority seem to prescribe eradication. Less is known about the management of H pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease, resulting in more marked differences in attitude and practice. Even in peptic ulcer disease, where most clinicians in both primary and secondary care believe that H pylori must be eradicated, there is often a breakdown in putting this belief into practice. There is also confusion about treatment regimens for H pylori eradication. Eradication regimens are less successful in practice than clinical trials. Moreover, a significant proportion of patients with peptic ulcer remain symptomatic despite treatment for ulcer diathesis, which can undermine confidence. Therapeutic confusion about what to prescribe, adverse effects limiting compliance, bacterial resistance, and socioeconomic factors can all impair therapeutic success with eradication therapy in practice. Unfortunately, it is well documented that guidelines alone have little or no effect in practice. Its publication in a journal is unlikely to lead to effective practice in primary care. Based on the available evidence, clinical behavior is likely to change when guidelines are developed by the intended peer group of clinicians, disseminated through a specific training program, and implemented by applying specific reminders, preferably during consultation. .",0,0,
895,Helping doctors and patients understand health statistics,"Many doctors, patients, journalists, and politicians alike do not understand what health statistics mean or inadvertently draw false conclusions. Collective statistical ignorance refers to the widespread inability to understand the meaning of numbers. For example, many citizens do not realize that higher survival rates with cancer screening do not mean longer life, or that the statement that mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by 25% actually means that 1 in 1000 women will die less. your disease. We present evidence that statistical literacy is (a) common to patients, journalists, and doctors""; (b) is created by the opaque framing of information, which is sometimes the unintentional result of a lack of understanding, but can also be the result of deliberate efforts to manipulate or persuade people and (c) it can have serious health consequences The causes of statistical literacy should not be attributed solely to cognitive biases but to the emotional nature of the doctor – the patient relationship and conflicts of interest in the health system. It also makes statistical literacy redundant.” So is the traditional combination of determinism (doctors looking for causes, not chances) and the illusion of certainty (patients looking for certainty when there is nothing). We show that fact sheets, Web sites, brochures, and even medical journals distributed to physicians by the pharmaceutical industry frequently report in opaque forms of evidence suggesting major benefits and minor harms of specific interventions. Without understanding the numbers involved, the public is open to political and commercial manipulation of their concerns and hopes, which undermines the goals of informed consent and shared decision-making. What can be done? We discuss the importance of teaching statistical thinking and transparent representations in primary and secondary education and medical school. But this requires early familiarization with the concept of probability and teaching children statistical literacy as the art of solving real-world problems rather than applying formulas to toy problems with coins and dice. An important prerequisite for statistical literacy is transparent risk communication. We recommend using frequency expressions instead of single event probabilities, absolute risks instead of relative risks, mortality instead of survival rates, and natural frequencies instead of conditional probabilities. There is a call for psychological research on transparent visual and digital forms of risk communication and for the training of physicians in their use. Statistical literacy is a necessary prerequisite for an educated citizenship in a technological democracy. Understanding risks and asking critical questions can also shape the emotional climate in a society so that hopes and worries can no longer be easily manipulated from the outside and citizens can develop a more informed and relaxed attitude towards their health.",0,1,
896,Helping hands: a randomized cluster trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two different strategies for promoting hand hygiene in hospital nurses.,"OBJECTIVE: Hand hygiene prescriptions are the most important measure in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections. However, compliance rates are often below 50% of all hand hygiene opportunities. This study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of two different strategies to promote hand hygiene in hospital nurses. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a cluster randomized controlled trial with inpatient wards as the randomization unit. In this study, hand hygiene rules will be applied. Two strategies will be used to increase compliance with hand hygiene guidelines. The latest strategy is derived from the literature and includes training, reminders, feedback and targeting adequate products and facilities. The expanded strategy also includes activities aimed at influencing social influence and developing leadership in groups. The unique contribution of the extended strategy builds on relevant behavioral science theories. The extended strategy includes all the elements of the latest strategy, supported by active commitment and gaining the initiative of the ward management, modeling by informal leaders in the ward, and setting norms and goals within the team. Data will be collected at four points in time at six-month intervals. An average of 3,000 hand hygiene opportunities will be observed across approximately 900 nurses at each time point. DISCUSSION: The implementation and evaluation of an implementation strategy that also targets the social context of the teams can contribute significantly to the overall knowledge in this area. The results from our study will enable us to draw conclusions about the effects of different strategies for the implementation of hand hygiene guidelines, and based on these results we will be able to define a preferred practice strategy for hospital-based nursing.

897,"Helping someone with problem drug use: a Delphi consensus study of consumers, caregivers, and clinicians","BACKGROUND: Problematic use of illicit drugs (ie drug use or addiction) is associated with significant health and social harms, highlighting the need for early intervention and health care participation. Family members, friends and colleagues play an important role in supporting and assisting individuals with problem drug use to seek professional help, but there are conflicting views on how and when this support should be offered. This document reports the development of mental health first aid guidelines for adult problem drug use to help inform community members about how they can help someone who develops problem drug use or is experiencing a drug-related crisis. METHODS: A systematic review of scientific and ordinary literature was undertaken to develop a 228-item questionnaire containing potential first aid strategies to help a person develop a drug problem or experience a drug-related crisis. Three expert panels (29 consumers, 31 caregivers and 27 clinicians) were recruited from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Panel members independently rated items in three rounds, with strategies to agree on the importance written on the guidelines. RESULTS: The overall response rate over the three rounds was 80% (86% consumers, 81% caregivers, 74% clinicians). The 140 first aid strategies were deemed necessary or important by 80% or more of the panel members. Approved strategies provide information and advice about what problem drug use is and its consequences, how to approach a person about problem drug use, tips for effective communication, what to do if the person does not want to change their drug use, and what to do. if the person seeks (or does not want) professional help, what are the drug-affected situations and how to deal with them, how to deal with adverse reactions that lead to a medical emergency, and what to do if the person is aggressive. RESULTS: The guides provide a consensus resource for community members who want to help someone with a drug problem. It is hoped that the guidelines will lead to better support and understanding for those with problem drug use and facilitate professional help and engagement.",0,0,

In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. In probable cases, the characteristics of 48 patients were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, and the results of liver function tests returned to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of three deaths possibly related to ketoconazole therapy, the drug was continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis. Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is recommended during prolonged therapy with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious liver damage.",0,0,

902,The herd: a new phenomenon affecting medical decision-making in multiple sclerosis care? Lessons learned from DIScUTIR MS,"OBJECTIVE: Herd is a phenomenon in which individuals follow the behavior of others instead of making independent decisions based on their private knowledge. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a herd-like phenomenon can occur when a neurologist follows a colleague's therapeutic advice, even though this is not supported by best practice clinical guidelines. There is currently limited information available on the role of herds in medical care. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of herd (and associated factors) in MS management. METHODS: We conducted a study across Spain among neurologists with expertise in MS care. Participants answered questions on the management of 20 case scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice and completed 3 questionnaires and 4 experimental paradigms based on behavioral economics. The herd experiment consisted of a case scenario of a 40-year-old woman who developed a self-limiting neurological event on subcutaneous interferon who was stable for 3 years. There were no new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions. His neurological examination and disability scores did not change. He was advised by an MS neurologist to switch from interferon to fingolimo, contrary to best practice guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate herd-related factors. RESULTS: Of the 161 neurologists invited to participate, 96 completed the study (response rate: 60%). The herd was present in 75 patients (78.1%) and had a similar prevalence in MS specialists and general neurologists (68.8% vs. 82.8%""; ""P=0.12). In multivariate analyses, the number of MS patients seen per week was positively associated with herd (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.14). Conversely, physician's age, gender, year of practice, practice environment, or risk preferences were not related to livestock. CONCLUSION: Swarming was a common phenomenon affecting approximately 8 out of 10 neurologists caring for MS patients. The herd can influence medical decisions and lead to worse outcomes in MS management.",0,0,

904,Heterogeneous demographic and cultural profiles of Chinese-American patients not committed to colorectal cancer screening: a covert class analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Chinese Americans, but CRC screening rates remain low. OBJECTIVE: To better inform clinical practice to effectively promote screening, we examined subgroups of Chinese-American patients who do not follow CRC screening guidelines. METHODS: Using confidential class analysis of data from 327 participants from 18 primary care clinics, we stratified nonadherent patients by sociodemographic, screening barriers, and attitudinal and clinical factors for screening for CRC. RESULTS: The optimal latent class analysis model identified 3 distinct classes: Western healthcare class (36%), Eastern healthcare class (18%), and mixed healthcare class (46%). Western healthcare class patients were highly educated, with an average of 20 years of US residency, a high level of English proficiency, the least Eastern culture views on care, and the most exposure to physician advice, but reported that they did not have time for screening. Patients in the Eastern healthcare class were highly educated elderly and recent immigrants with the least CRC knowledge and the most Eastern cultural views. The mixed-health class patients had a low level of education, had resided in the United States for 20 years, and half had had service from their physicians for at least 3 years, but their knowledge and cultural views were similar to those of Eastern health-class patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherent Chinese-American patients are heterogeneous. It is essential to have future intervention programs tailored to address specific screening beliefs and barriers for subtypes of maladaptive patients. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Training primary care physicians to recognize patients' different demographic characteristics and healthcare beliefs can facilitate communication with patients to overcome barriers and improve screening behaviors.",0,0,
905,Heterogeneous Effect of Emergency Service Expert Graphic System,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare the results obtained from different modules of the Emergency Service Expert Table System (occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, low back pain and fever in children). Each module of this electronic medical record provides real-time recommendations based on clinical guidelines embedded in the software. METHODS: Childhood fever, low back pain, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids in the emergency department of a university hospital. We measured documentation quality as the percentage of key items included in the medical record and discharge instructions, the percentage of appropriate testing and treatment decisions, median fees per patient visit, physician satisfaction with pre-experiment and post-experiment surveys, and patient satisfaction based on: phone survey. RESULTS: Emergency Service Expert Graphics System improved documentation rates for all modules. The Emergency Room Specialist Table System has consistently improved the relevance of diagnostic testing and the relevance of treatment decisions for patients occupationally exposed to blood and body fluids, while also reducing median wages. For low back pain and fever in the children's modules, improvements in the suitability of testing and treatment were less consistent and did not result in a reduction in wages. Although physicians generally supported the intervention, physicians' use of the Emergency Service Specialist Table System and their satisfaction with the modules were mostly related to occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, and least to fever in children. For each referral complaint, average patient satisfaction was highest in the Emergency Service Specialist Table System stage. CONCLUSION: Delivery of guidelines via an electronic medical record with background decision support improved documentation, patient care, and patient satisfaction, although the effects were heterogeneous among complaints submission. The optimal guideline implementation strategy will likely depend on the nature of the clinical problem and the type of healthcare delivery environment. For selected problems, providing guidelines in this format over the Internet holds great promise for changing physician behavior and improving care (see http://www.needlestick.mednet.ucla.edu).",0,1,

Evaluation and management of suicidal ideation and behavior for the elderly is especially important to primary care physicians, as many patients visit their physicians shortly before committing suicide. In 1993, the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR) published clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of depression in primary care settings. The AHCPR guidelines have provided some assistance in identifying and treating suicidal patients. However, this guideline lacked detailed and specific instructions for managing high-risk patients in the context of intervention research.

907,Historical background of changes in FDA policy regarding the review and evaluation of drugs in women,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made two major changes to its policy for the examination and evaluation of drugs in women: (1) gender-specific analyzes of the safety and efficacy of drugs will be required as part of all new drugs. (2) it will no longer be recommended to restrict women of childbearing potential from participating in the early stages of drug trials. These changes have come as a result of continued efforts to individualize therapy, improve the safety and efficacy of drugs, and answer important questions about whether the drug development process has produced adequate information about the effects of drugs in women. In turn, these efforts are the result of a long history of changes in clinical care for women in the United States, changes in the use of women as research subjects, and shifting attitudes about the balance between protection and risks for women in clinical trials. and national movements to focus on women's health issues and transform the male-focused clinical research model.

DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING 40 public high schools in the state of Morelos, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS 10 954 first year high school students. INTERVENTION Schools were randomized into one of three arms: an HIV prevention course that promotes condom use, the same course with emergency contraception as a backup, or an existing sex education course. Self-administered anonymous questionnaires were completed at baseline, four months, and 16 months. Students in intervention schools took a 30-hour course (over 15 weeks) in HIV prevention and life skills, designed in accordance with the guidelines of the joint United Nations program on HIV/AIDS. In the introduction of the contraception arm and condom, the students were given two hours of extra training on emergency contraception. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure, condom use, was reported. Other outcomes were “sexual activity”; knowledge and attitudes about HIV and emergency contraception; and attitudes and confidence regarding condom use. RESULTS The intervention did not affect reported condom use. Both HIV knowledge in the intervention arms and knowledge of emergency contraception in the contraception arm and condom promotion increased. Reported sexual behavior was similar in the intervention arms and control group CONCLUSION A rigorously designed, implemented and evaluated HIV education course in public high schools did not reduce risk behavior, so such courses need to be redesigned and evaluated. The addition of emergency contraception did not reduce reported condom use or risky sexual behavior did not increase, but did increase the reported use of emergency contraception.",0,0,

911,Home blood pressure management and improved blood pressure control: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: To determine which of the 3 interventions was most effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, we conducted a 4-arm randomized trial with 18-month follow-up at primary care clinics at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to usual care or to one of 3 telephone-based intervention groups: (1) nurse-administered behavioral management, (2) nurse- and physician-administered medication management, or (3) a combination of both. Out of 1551 eligible patients, 593 were randomized"";"" 48% were African American. Intervention phone calls were triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices. Behavior management included promoting health behaviors. Medication management included the adjustment of medications by a study doctor and nurse based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary outcome was change in BP control measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Both behavioral management and drug management alone were at 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-24.1%) and 12.5% (95% CI, 1.3%) at 12 months. -23.6% showed significant improvements – but not at 18 months. In subgroup analyzes, among those with poor baseline BP control, systolic BP at 12 months was 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) and 8.0 mm Hg (95% CI) in the combined intervention group. , - 15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months based on usual care.

METHODS: To explore the implications of HT cessation at Group Health and Harvard Vanguard, the large integrated healthcare systems in the Northwest and Northeast United States, we conducted a survey focusing on differences between specialties and field of study. RESULTS: The response rate to the written questionnaire (posted between December 2005 and May 2006) was 78.5% (736/928)""; this article reports the results of 483 eligible physicians. Most physicians (91%) advised to discontinue oral HT. not immediate discontinuation (8%) and most (60%) recommended reduction of both dose and days of the week. About 60% of physicians reported no experience with tape reduction. Harvard Vanguard physicians more likely to encourage discontinuation than Group Health physicians A woman is less likely to recommend continuing HT when her symptoms return after stopping HT. only 2% were based on research evidence. Physicians have approved a variety of approaches to manage symptoms after discontinuation of HT, mostly behavioral changes (44%) and increased exercise (37%), and these approaches have been endorsed by Harvard Vanguard physicians and obstetrician/gynecologists from Group Health physicians or family practitioners or internists.

However, little data are available on the day-to-day practice of hospital clinicians working with cancer patients who smoke. In this study, the smoking habits of physicians in a comprehensive cancer center, their clinical practice in providing smoking cessation interventions to smokers, and the training they received in this area are evaluated. METHODS: A Web-based questionnaire was sent to 285 physicians. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 75%. 62%, 24%, and 14% of respondents were never-smokers, former and current non-smokers, respectively. Six percent of all responding physicians have already attended smoking cessation training, and 43% declared that they would like to receive training. Of all responding physicians, 86% asked about patients' smoking status, 50% recommended patients routinely quit smoking, and 32% rated their motivation to do so. Smoking cessation guidelines were not followed mostly due to lack of time, fear of increasing the stress of patients and lack of smoking cessation education. Of the physicians surveyed, 94% referred to the outpatient smoking cessation service, 65% referred at least one patient, 66% knew the inpatient service, and 36% requested at least one intervention in the ward. CONCLUSION: This study showed that physicians working in a leading cancer center partially complied with smoking cessation guidelines.

919,How did formative research inform the development of a women's group intervention in rural Nepal?,"The failure to reduce newborn and maternal mortality in poor countries is sometimes blamed on the lack of contextual information about care practices and care-seeking behaviour. There is a lack of information on how to translate formative research into effective interventions to improve maternal and newborn health. We describe the findings of formative research and how they have been used to inform the development of such an intervention in rural Nepal. Formative research was carried out in four parts. Part 1 included field familiarity and literature review, and chapters 2, 3, and 4 included qualitative and quantitative studies of community mapping, health care supervision, and perinatal care behaviors. Participatory approaches have been successful in reducing neonatal deaths and may be appropriate in our context. Community mapping and profiling helped define community context, and we have seen community-based organizations often try to involve Community Mobility Women Volunteers in community mobilization. He did not routinely hold monthly meetings and found them difficult to maintain without support and supervision. Most primary care staff in health facilities were on duty, but referral centers lacked doctors and nurses. Mortality estimates reflecting underreporting of deaths and coverage of hygiene and infection control strategies were low. Most women give birth at home with their mother-in-law, friends and neighbors. During perinatal illness, care was often sought from traditional healers. Cultural problems such as shyness, fear and normality restricted women's behaviors during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period, and decisions about their health were generally taken after communication with family and society. Formative research demonstrated the type of intervention that could be successful. It should be community based and not just for pregnant women. It should address discussions within families and provide information based on the needs of local groups and specific stakeholders such as mothers-in-laws and traditional healers. Intervention should not only acknowledge cultural constructs, but also be a forum for discussing ideas of pollution, shame and seclusion. We used these guidelines to develop a participatory, community-based women's group intervention facilitated through a community action cycle. The success of our intervention may be due to its acceptability at the community level and its sensitivity to the needs and beliefs of families and communities.",0,0,
920,How Do Clinicians Prefer Cultural Competence Education? Findings from the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview Field Trial,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze the training methods, reasons, and relationships between demographic characteristics and method preferences that were reported to be the most and least helpful by clinicians during the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview field trial. METHOD: The authors used mixed methods to analyze interviews from 75 clinicians on five continents regarding their training preferences after a standardized training session and the clinicians' initial administration of the Cultural Formulation Interview. Content analysis identified the most and least helpful training methods by reason. Bivariate and logistic regression analysis compared clinician characteristics with method preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Often, clinicians called case-based behavioral simulations the ""most helpful"" and video the ""least helpful"" training methods. Unadjusted and then country-clustered bivariate and logistic regression models found that each additional year of a clinician's age was associated with a preference for behavioral simulations: OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.10"";"" p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians preferred active behavioral simulations in cultural competence training, and this effect was most pronounced among older clinicians.

921,How does the self-reported clinical management of patients with low back pain relate to the attitudes and beliefs of health care practitioners? A survey of UK general practitioners and physical therapists,"Guidelines for the management of low back pain (LBP) have been available for many years, but adherence to them by healthcare practitioners (HCPs) is still not optimal. The aim of this study was to measure the attitudes, beliefs and reported clinical behavior of UK physical therapists (PTs) and general practitioners (GPs) about LBP and to explore the relationships between them. A cross-sectional questionnaire was conducted by mail among GPs (n=2000) and PTs (n=2000) including the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (PABT.PT) and a vignette of a patient with nonspecific LBP (NSLBP). with questions asking advice on work, activity and bed rest. Data from 1022 participants (442 GPs and 580 PTs) who had recently treated patients with LBP were analyzed. While the majority of HCPs reported that they made recommendations for the sketch patient that were broadly consistent with the guidelines recommendations, 28% reported that they would advise this patient to stay away from work. Job advice, opt-out advice with PABS.PT scores associated with higher biomedical (F(1.986)=77.5, p<0.0001) and lower behavioral (F(1.981)=31.9, p<0.001) scores was significantly associated with We have shown that the attitudes and reported practice behaviors of UK practitioners and PTs for patients with NSLBP are diverse. Many HCPs had the belief that LBP required some avoidance from activities and work. The attitudes and beliefs of these HCPs were correlated with their self-reported clinical behavior regarding work-related advice. Future studies need to explore whether approaches aimed at modifying these HCP factors can lead to better patient outcomes.",0,0,
922,How many steps/day is enough? for children and adolescents,"Worldwide, public health physical activity guidelines place special emphasis on the child (typically 6-11 years) and adolescent (typically 12-19 years) populations. Existing guidelines are often expressed in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity of behavior. However, the simple step output from both accelerometers and pedometers is gaining increasing credibility in research and practice as a reasonable estimate of daily ambulatory physical activity volume. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the available child and adolescent, objectively tracked step-definition physical activity literature to provide researchers, practitioners, and ordinary people who use accelerometers and pedometers with evidence-based translations of these public health guidelines in terms of steps. /day.

924,How institutional escalation prevention potential impacts the success of implementing innovations: electronic medical records in hospitals,"Background Engagement is the tendency to continue (innovation) projects even when it is clear that they will not be successful and/or will be excessively costly. The ability to stop or redirect implementation processes that do not meet an organization's expectations, anti-escalation potential (EPP) can prevent an organization from wasting time and money on failed projects. EPP consists of a set of checks and balances built into managerial practices that protect management against irrational (but very human) decisions and can limit the escalation of implementation projects. We explore whether successful implementation of electronic medical records (EMRs) is related to EPP and the organizational factors that create this relationship. Methods Structural equation modeling (SEM), using survey data from 427 doctors and 631 nurses with experience in the implementation and use of EMRs in hospitals, was applied to examine whether formal governance and organizational culture mediated the relationship between EPP and perceived added value. EMRs. Results Doctors and nurses in hospitals with more EPPs report more successful implementation of EMR (in terms of perceived added value of EMR). Formal governance mediates the relationship between EPP and implementation success. We found no evidence that an open or innovative culture explains the relationship between EPP and implementation success. Results There is a positive correlation between the level of EPP and the perceived added value of EMRs. This relationship is explained by the formal governance mechanisms of organizations. This means that management has a set of tangible tools to positively influence the success of innovation processes. However, it also means that management must be able to critically reflect on (previous) actions and decisions and be willing to change plans if EPP elements indicate that the implementation process is hindered.",0,0,

In our experiment, physicians select the amounts of medical care for patients with different health conditions. We see that doctors offer significantly more services on a per-service basis than per person. Patients are over-serviced and under-serviced per person. However, payment incentives are not the only motivation for physicians' quantity choices, as patients' health benefits are also of great importance.

928,How to improve the acceptance and use of colon cancer screening recommendations by physicians and the public?,"The Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening presentation is a multidisciplinary initiative that aims to reduce the incidence and mortality from CRC without adversely affecting the health status of the participants. Adopting a public health perspective includes a commitment to ensure equity in access and sustainability of the program over time. We reviewed the available evidence on predictors of CRC screening uptake and the impact of interventions to improve screening adoption, using conceptual frameworks that define the role of determinants of preventive behaviors and the reach and target of interventions. The results of this review suggest that policy measures aimed at supporting screening delivery as well as organizational changes affecting the operational characteristics of preventive services must be implemented to allow the individual's motivation to finally materialize. To ensure coverage and equity of access and maximize the impact of the response, policies should be adopted to implement organized programs, ensuring that participation in screening and any follow-up assessment is not constrained by financial barriers. Beliefs of participants and providers may determine the response to different screening methods. To achieve the desired health effect, active monitoring of people with screening abnormalities should be implemented, supported by infrastructure changes and multidisciplinary teamwork that can ensure the sustainability of effective interventions over time.

In addition, 11 policy makers, managers and decision makers of the health system took part in OGD. Suggested interventions are classified into the following themes: Fiscal, Organizational, Regulatory and Multifaceted interventions for health professionals. CONCLUSION: The use of KPGs should be planned along with the adaptation and development process"";"" otherwise the time and money spent would be in vain. Admittedly, it is beyond the capacity of certain groups or a few academic centers to impose the above-mentioned interventions with the ultimate goal of sustainable behavior change in health system service providers. It requires the participation of all practitioners under the supervision and support of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Expanding the family medicine plan and referral system is an opportunity that should be considered as a reward.",0,0,
930,How are therapeutic recommendations in clinical practice guidelines translated into guidelines for critiquing doctor's prescriptions? Methods and application of the five directives,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines give advice on what to do in a variety of medical situations, including therapeutic recommendations for drug prescribing. An effective way to computerize these recommendations is to design critical decision support systems, that is, systems that criticize physician prescriptions when they do not follow guidelines. These systems are commonly based on a list of ""if conditions then criticism"" rules. However, writing these rules from manuals is no simple task. The purpose of this article is to propose methods that (1) simplify the implementation of the therapeutic recommendations of guidelines in criticism systems by automatically translating structured therapeutic recommendations into a list of ""if circumstances criticize"" rules, and (2) can produce an appropriate outcome. Text label explaining why the doctor's prescription is not recommended. METHODS: We studied the therapeutic recommendations in five clinical practice guidelines for chronic disease related to cardiovascular risk management. We evaluated the system using a test base of more than 2000 cases. RESULTS: Algorithms are presented to automatically translate therapeutic recommendations into “if conditions criticize” rules. Eight general recommendations are also proposed"";"" they are independent of the guideline and can be used as default behavior to address various situations often covered in guidelines, such as reducing the dose of a poorly tolerated drug. Finally, we present models and methods for constructing a human-readable text critique. The system was successfully evaluated on a test basis. CONCLUSION: We have shown that it is possible to criticize physician prescriptions and provide clear explanations based on a structured clinical guideline. We are now planning a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of the system on applications.",0,0,
931,How well do clinicians follow dementia practice guidelines?,"Although there are many clinical guidelines on dementia management, there are few studies on their practical application. Clinicians at six United States Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers (n = 200, 85% response rate) were surveyed to use the practices recommended in the California Working Group Guidelines for Alzheimer's Disease Management. Most providers (89% to 73%) reported routinely performing neurological examinations, taking history from caregivers, discussing diagnosis with patient's family, discussing permanent power of attorney, and making legally required notices for drivers with dementia. Nearly two-thirds of providers said they routinely perform cognitive screening exams, screen for depression, report elder abuse, and discuss care needs and decision-making with patients' families. Only half of outpatients have implemented caregiver support practices for at least half of their patients. Clinicians' choices of drugs for cognition, mood, and behavior problems were largely consistent with current practice guidelines. These results suggest possible priorities for quality improvement efforts. More research is needed to clarify the reasons for specific gaps between guidelines and practice and to identify specific targets for intervention.",0,0,

936,Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): study protocol and implementation challenges,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the adult US population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension are at target blood pressure. The chronic care model proposes that blood pressure control can be achieved by improving the way patients and physicians handle patient self-care. METHODS AND DESIGN: This article describes the protocol of a 2 x 2 nested randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians on systolic blood pressure. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to physician intervention or physician control condition. Physician randomization occurred at the clinical level. Physician intervention included education and performance monitoring. The training consisted of 2 internet-based modules detailing both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle changes for hypertension. Performance data were collected for 18 months and feedback was given to physicians every 3 months. Patient participants in both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to either patient intervention or usual care. The patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention conducted in 20 group sessions by trained responders, followed by 12-month phone calls by community health counselors. Follow-up measurements were made at 6 and 18 months. The primary outcome was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with diastolic blood pressure and adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months. CONCLUSION: Overall, 8 treatments (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4"" per treatment; 16 per treatment group), and 574 patients (289 controls and 285 interventions) were enrolled. The main characteristics of patients and providers and the difficulties encountered during the implementation of the study are presented. By addressing key components of the chronic care model, HIP interventions can improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular disease risk in the primary care setting. The study design allows evaluation of the efficacy and cost of individual physician and patient interventions so that healthcare organizations can make informed decisions about the implementation of one or both interventions in the context of local resources.

937,Hypertension improvement project: random quality improvement trial for doctors and lifestyle change for patients,"Despite widely publicized hypertension treatment guidelines for physicians and lifestyle recommendations for patients, blood pressure control rates remain low. We conducted a nested, 2 x 2 randomized, controlled trial of control versus physician intervention and/or control versus patient intervention in community-based primary care clinics. Physician intervention included internet-based training, self-monitoring, and quarterly feedback reports. Patient intervention included 20 group sessions per week, followed by 12 months of telephone counseling contact, and focused on weight loss, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, diet regimen, exercise, and reduced sodium intake. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Eight primary care practices (32 physicians) were randomized into physician intervention or control groups. Among these practices, 574 patients were randomized to patient intervention or control groups. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, 61% were female and 37% were black. Blood pressure data were available for 91% of patients at 6 months. The main effect of physician intervention on systolic blood pressure at 6 months was 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.2""; P=0.72), adjusted for baseline pressure. Main effect of patient intervention was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.4 to 0.7; P=0.01 The interaction of 2 interventions was significant (P=0.03), with the greatest effect physician and patient intervention (9.7 +/- 12.7) mm Hg) Differences between treatment groups did not persist at 18 months Combined physician and patient interventions lower blood pressure; Future research should focus on improving the efficacy and sustainability of these interventions.",0,0,
938,Hypertension in black patients: an update,"Black individuals are at high risk for hypertension and increased morbidity, particularly from cardiovascular and renal disease. A better understanding of racial differences in hypertension in terms of risk factors, patient/physician behaviors, and treatment outcomes is key to improving race-focused care in black patients. Recent data suggest that black patients progress more rapidly from prehypertension to hypertension, emphasizing the need for early and prompt intervention. Unfortunately, adherence and persistence to antihypertensive therapy are often poor in black patients, compounded by the increased need for multidrug therapy in this patient population. Treatment strategies currently under investigation focus on methods to improve self-care behaviors and adherence to medication. As this is a constantly and rapidly evolving field of study, this article provides an update of recent findings that should be relevant and interesting to clinicians.",0,0,
939,Identifying and evaluating salient physical activity beliefs of colorectal cancer survivors,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has been associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence and longer survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors"";"" however, less than a third of CRC survivors meet PA guidelines. Interventions to promote PA in CRC survivors need to understand the most critical beliefs that influence PA behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the strength of associations between the most common PA beliefs of CRC survivors and motivational constructs from Planned Behavior Theory (TPB) and PA behavior. INTERVENTION/METHODS: Colorectal cancer survivors (n = 600) residing in Alberta, Canada completed self-report questionnaires that assessed medical and demographic variables, PA beliefs, constructs from TPB, and PA behavior. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer survivors identified increased vitality (69.5%), family members (67.3%), and medical/health problems (8.8%) as the most common behavioral, normative, and control beliefs, respectively. All PA beliefs were significantly associated with all TPB constructs and PA. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity interventions for CRC survivors should target multiple salient beliefs, including behavioral, normative, and control beliefs. APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Insights into salient beliefs about PA in CRC survivors can guide nurses in developing successful strategies to promote PA in this population and possibly improve quality of life and possibly disease outcomes.",0,0,
940,Identifying perceived pain management barriers in Iranian children: a qualitative study,"Hospitalized children often receive inadequate treatment for their pain. Pediatric nurses experience these deficiencies more than other healthcare team members. This research was an attempt in the form of a phenomenological study to uncover some of the key barriers to pain management in children as perceived by nurses. Sixteen nurses were interviewed in the medical, surgical and infectious children's wards of a hospital in Iran. The data analysis was based on the Colaizzi method, which revealed three main themes in different domains: organizational barriers, limitations related to the characteristics of the child, and barriers related to the nature of the illness and its treatments. Study results demonstrated organizational limitations added to the lack of authority to administer some medical interventions, inadequate equipment and ancillary tools, and the absence of opioids as main pain control and limiting factors. Additional factors related to child characteristics such as age, temperament, behavior, expression, and gender influence the assessment and treatment of pain. The results revealed barriers identified in the real context. Some guidelines seem to be needed to achieve optimal pain management.",0,0,
941,"Identification, assessment and management of obesity in an academic primary health care center","OBJECTIVE: The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity among children is one of the most challenging dilemmas facing pediatricians today. As the medical community struggles to develop effective strategies to treat this epidemic, timely identification of obesity by pediatric healthcare providers remains a crucial first step in obesity management. OBJECTIVE: A direct evaluation of the performance of pediatric clinicians in detecting and managing obesity in clinical practice has not been performed to date. The aim of this study was to determine the rates at which pediatric residents, nurses, and faculty members identify obesity in an academic primary care setting and describe the measures taken by these providers in assessing and managing obesity. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review of all health surveillance visits for children aged 3 months to 16 years reviewed between 1 December 2001 and 28 February 2002 was performed. For children, 120% of 50 percent of height-weight was defined as obese. For children > or = 5 years of age, a body mass index >95th percentile for age and sex was defined as obese. SETTING: A large primary care practice located in a tertiary, academic, pediatric hospital serving a predominantly urban, minority (70% African American), Medical Aid insured (90%) population. PARTICIPANTS: Primary care providers, including pediatric residents, nurse practitioners, and faculty physicians. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients out of 2515 visits examined met the working definition of obesity, revealing an estimated prevalence of obesity visits of 9.7% between health surveillance visits for children aged 3 months to 16 years. This prevalence of obesity visits cannot be used to estimate the population prevalence of obesity, given the skewed distribution of visits to very young children. For all children meeting the obesity study definition, providers documented obesity in their evaluations in only 53% (129 visits) of the visits reviewed. Although the majority of tables (69%) contained a history of adequate nutrition, only 15% included a description of the child's activity level or television viewing. Physical examination revealed obesity in 39% of the cases. For children in whom obesity was identified as a problem by clinicians (129 patients), 81% of the charts included a history of adequate nutrition, while 27% included a description of the child's activity level or television viewing. Physical examination revealed obesity in 64% of the cases. Most children identified as obese by their providers received some treatment specific to their obesity, including education, screening, and specialist referral. Dietary changes were recommended for 71%, increased activity for 33%, and television viewing restriction only for 5%. Eighty-three percent of providers recommended close follow-up. Other recommendations included referral to a dietitian (22%), screening laboratory studies (13%), a food diary (9%), endocrine referral (5%), or referral to preventive cardiology (3%). The provider's definition of obesity was influenced by the patient's age and degree of obesity. Diagnosis of obesity was lowest among preschool children (31%) and highest in adolescent patients (76%). Providers who evaluated older and heavier children were also more likely to take activity histories, note obesity on physical examination, recommend activity changes, refer the patient to a nutritionist, receive screening lab studies, and recommend close follow-up monitoring. The determination of obesity and other outcome variables was not significantly affected by provider education or patient gender. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of childhood obesity has now reached epidemic proportions, it was underrecognized and undertreated by pediatric primary care providers in our study. Providers identified obesity as a problem for only half of the obese children examined for health checkup. The lowest obesity identification rates occurred among children <5 years of age and children with milder obesity. Identification did not evolve with additional years of pediatric training. Even for the subgroup of children defined as obese by their providers, assessment and treatment were often inconsistent with current recommendations. For example, more attention has been paid to the role of diet compared to activity in the assessment of obesity. Notably, despite the evidence linking television viewing and pediatric obesity, only a small number of providers (5%) offered a reduction in television viewing to their obese patients. This finding is alarming because obesity is known to be a multifactorial disease that responds to significant changes in both dietary and activity behaviors. Only 13% of providers requested laboratory studies as part of their recommendations. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends screening for a lipid profile, total cholesterol level, and type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of the obesity assessment. Most clinicians who requested laboratory studies included thyroid function tests, which are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics because the likelihood of hypothyroidism as a cause of obesity is very low. While the extent of assessment and management for children considered obese did not meet current guidelines, they were much better than patients not identified as obese by their providers. This illustrates the importance of timely identification as a critical first step in the management of obesity. The results of this study are particularly discouraging as evidence grows for the importance of early intervention in preventing the medical and psychosocial sequelae of obesity and the persistence of obesity into adulthood. This study highlights the need for increased awareness and identification of obesity in primary care, particularly among young children and those with mild obesity.",0,0,
942,Identifying and reducing errors with surgical simulation,"The main determinant of a patient's safety and outcome is the skill and judgment of the surgeon. While evaluating the knowledge base and decision-making process in the profession, the technical skills inherent in the profession are not. Innovative state-of-the-art simulation devices that train both surgical tasks and skills without posing risk to patients should allow the detection and analysis of errors and ""near misses"". Studies have validated the use of a sophisticated endoscopic sinus surgery simulator (ES3) for procedural training of residents. Evaluations are ongoing as to whether integrating a comprehensive ES3 training program into residency curricula will have long-term effects on surgical performance and patient outcomes. Using a variety of otolaryngology specialties, subjects receive mentoring training on ES3 as well as minimally invasive trainers such as MIST-VR. Technical errors are identified and measured in the simulator and intraoperatively. Through a web-based database, individual performance can be compared to a national standard. An upgraded version of ES3 will be developed to support patient-specific anatomical models. This advance will allow the effects of simulated rehearsal of patient-specific procedures (task rehearsal) to be investigated on patient outcomes and surgical errors during the actual procedure. The knowledge gained from these studies will help to use the next generation of surgical simulators that are expected to have a significant impact on patient safety.",0,1,
943,"Identifying barriers and facilitators for a triage, treatment, and transfer clinical intervention to manage acute stroke patients in the emergency department: a systematic review using the theoretical domains framework (TDF).","BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend that the evaluation and management of stroke patients begin early, including in the emergency services (ED). To inform the development of a targeted practice intervention in the emergency department, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies to identify relevant barriers and facilitators to six key clinical behaviors in acute stroke care: appropriate triage, management of thrombolysis, monitoring and management of temperature, blood glucose levels, and swallowing difficulties. and transfer of stroke patients in the emergency department. METHODS: Any design study conducted in the emergency department that identifies barriers or facilitators based on primary data for one or more of these six clinical behaviors. Major biomedical databases (CINAHL, OVID SP EMBASE, OVID SP MEDLINE) were searched using comprehensive search strategies. Barriers and facilitators were categorized using the theoretical domain framework (TDF). The behavior modification technique (BCT) that best aligns with the strategy represented by each activator was selected for each of the activators reported using a standardized classification. RESULTS: Of the 44 identified studies, five qualitative studies and four questionnaires met the selection criteria. Most reported barriers correspond to the ""environmental, context, and resources"" (such as stressful working conditions or lack of resources) and ""knowledge"" (such as lack of guideline awareness or familiarity) areas of TDF. Most providers corresponded to the areas of ""knowledge"" (such as education for physicians about the calculated risk of bleeding following intravenous thrombolysis [tPA]) and ""skills"" (such as providing an opportunity to treat stroke cases of varying complexity). The total number of BCTs assigned was 18. The BCTs most frequently assigned to the reported activators were ""focus on past achievement"" and ""information about health outcomes"". CONCLUSIONS: Barriers and facilitators for providing key evidence-based protocols in an emergency were identified and interpreted within a relevant theoretical framework. This new knowledge has since been used to select specific BCTs to implement evidence-based care in an emergency room setting. It is recommended that findings from future similar reviews adopt a similar theoretical approach. In particular, the use of existing matrices to assist in the selection of relevant BCTs.",0,0,
944,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Common and Emerging Hypotheses About Its Pathogenesis and Effects on Treatment,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and often fatal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, causing irreversible deterioration of lung architecture. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms have yet to be determined, the prevailing hypothesis is that fibrosis is triggered and preceded by a chronic inflammatory process that damages the lung and modulates lung fibrogenesis, leading to end-stage fibrotic scarring. However, there is little evidence that inflammation is evident in early disease, and it is unclear whether inflammation is related to the development of the fibrotic process. Evidence suggests that inflammation does not play a crucial role. Inflammation is not a prominent histopathological finding, and epithelial damage is sufficient to induce fibrosis in the absence of ongoing inflammation. In addition, the inflammatory response to a lung fibrogenic injury is not necessarily related to the fibrotic response. Clinical measures of inflammation do not correlate with stage or outcome, and strong anti-inflammatory therapy does not improve outcome. This review provides a growing body of evidence to suggest that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis includes abnormal wound healing in response to multiple, microscopic regions of ongoing alveolar epithelial damage and activation associated with the formation of patchy fibroblast-myofibroblast foci that develop into fibrosis. Progress in understanding the fibrogenic mechanisms in the lung will likely enable more effective treatments.",0,0,

Materials and methods Quasi-experimental design with nine intervention applications and 61 control applications in the Implementing Partner Research Network, a network of applications all using the same EHR (Practicing Partner). Nine intervention apps were located in nine US states. The design included a baseline data collection period of 3 months (October-December 2009) and a 15-month follow-up (January 2010-March 2011) prior to the start of the intervention. The main outcome measures were prescription of antibiotics in episodes of ARI for which antibiotics were unsuitable and prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics in all episodes of ARI. Results In adult patients, the prescription of antibiotics in ARI attacks in which antibiotics were inappropriate decreased more in intervention practices (+4.2%) than in control practices (-0.6%) (p=0.03). However, among adults, the CDSS intervention improved the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics, with a 1.1% increase in control practices versus a 16.6% decrease in intervention practices (p<0.0001). A similar effect in broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing was found in pediatric patients, with a 19.7% decrease in intervention applications versus a 0.9% increase in control applications (p<0.0001).

947,Effect of computerized clinical decision support system on reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use: a randomized controlled trial.,"Objective: Many hospitals leverage antimicrobial management teams (AMTs) to improve patient care. But most of them work with minimal computer support. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a computerized clinical decision support system for the management of antimicrobial use. Design: A randomized controlled trial in adult patients hospitalized between May 10 and August 3, 2004. Antimicrobial use was managed by an existing AMT using the system in the intervention arm and without the system in the control arm. The system was developed to alert AMT of potentially inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Measures: Outcomes evaluated were hospital antimicrobial expenditure, mortality, length of hospital stay, and time spent managing antimicrobial use. Results: AMT spent approximately one hour less each day in the intervention arm compared to 359 (16%) of the 2,237 patients in the intervention arm and 180 (8%) of the 2,270 patients in the control arm. Hospital antimicrobial expenditures were $285,812 in the intervention arm and $370,006 in the control arm, resulting in savings of $84,194 (23%), or $37.64 per patient. No significant difference was observed in mortality (3.26% vs 2.95%, p = 0.55) or length of hospital stay (3.84 vs. 3.99 days, p = 0.38). Conclusion: The use of the system has facilitated antimicrobial use management, allowing AMT to treat more patients receiving inadequate antimicrobial therapy, resulting in significant time and cost savings for the hospital. This is the first study to demonstrate in a patient-controlled randomized trial that computerized clinical decision support systems can improve existing antimicrobial management programs.",0,1,

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) on compliance with guidelines on empirical antibiotic prescriptions (antibiotic and duration) for UTIs in emergency departments. Methods A multicenter, prospective, pre- and post-controlled interventional study was conducted between 19 March and 28 October 2012. All adults diagnosed with community-acquired UTI (cystitis, pyelonephritis or prostatitis) in three French Emergency Departments were included. If antibiotics and prescribed duration were in accordance with national guidelines, antibiotic therapy was considered in accordance with guidelines. Data were collected using electronic medical records. Paired tests were used when comparing periods within each ED, and global analyzes used multivariate logistic mixed models. Results Nine hundred and twelve patients were included during the 30-week study period. CDSS was used in 59% (182/307) of cases. The CDSS intervention improved compliance with antibiotic prescriptions in only one emergency room in a bivariate analysis (absolute increase +20%, P?=?0.007). Antibiotic selection was improved in multivariate analyses, but only when CDSS was used [OR?=?1.94 (95% CI 1.13--3.32)].

Results No overall effect of the intervention was found after adjusting for condition, practice size, child age, gender, and in-app clustering. Conclusions This methodologically rigorous assessment of a widely used quality improvement technique did not have a significant impact on the processes or outcomes of care for children with asthma. Potential shortcomings in program implementation, project duration, sample selection, and data sources preclude a general conclusion that such an improvement program is ineffective. Additional rigorous studies should be performed under more optimal settings to evaluate the effectiveness of this method for improving care.",0,1,

Gentamicin use also increased from a mean of 30.0 to 48.3 DDD/1000 bed days (P = 0.0001). Conclusion: The web-based antimicrobial approval system resulted in a sustained reduction in CEFX use over 15 months as well as increased prescription compliance with antibiotic guidelines. It has potential for linking with electronic prescribing and broader use for other drugs and research into the epidemiology of antibiotic use.",0,1,
954,Impact of an educational intervention on improving prescribing by private physicians in Uganda,"INTRODUCTION: Private doctors in urban Uganda treat a large percentage of common adult diseases. Improving their prescribing will not only encourage smarter drug use, but will also reduce patients' costs. Interventions to improve drug use are generally more successful when face-to-face education methods are included. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a face-to-face educational intervention for the treatment of acute respiratory infections (ARI), malaria and non-dysentery diarrhea by private physicians in three urban areas of Uganda. METHODS: The study used an intervention with a comparative group design to evaluate the impact of the educational intervention. A total of 108 private physicians were divided into intervention (n=30) and control (n=78) groups. Surrogate patients trained to simulate symptoms and signs of target conditions were used to collect data on physicians' medical practices and prescribing behaviors. Intervention physicians were invited to a one-day interactive training seminar facilitated by local opinion leaders, covering the principles of rational drug use and National Standard Treatment Guidelines for the treatment of target conditions. Physicians were also provided with data on key practices. RESULTS: Baseline data showed high rates of inappropriate treatment practices by both the intervention and control groups. There was almost universal use of antibiotics for ARI (over 90%), high recommended injection rates for malaria (over 30%), and high rates of polypharmacy (more than this drug per patient). After the intervention, some significant improvements in core practices were observed in the intervention group. Compared with control physicians, the intervention group had 23% reduced antibiotic prescriptions for ARI, 28% reduced use of combination products for malaria, trends towards better adherence to guidelines for ARI and malaria, and marginal reductions in drug costs. However, the overall effects of the intervention were limited, particularly on quality indicators related to history taking, adequate examination, and advice to patients. CONCLUSION: The face-to-face educational intervention resulted in some minor improvements in the basic prescribing practices of private physicians. However, an intervention that includes repeated contacts with prescribers and addresses economic considerations will be needed to achieve greater improvements. Private physicians need to be sensitized to and encouraged to use the National Standards of Treatment Guidelines, and attempts to improve their prescribing should be supported by community education.",0,0,
955,The impact of clinical practice guidelines on clinicians' behavior: tonsillectomy in children,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the extent to which the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines to list children with tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) influenced the behavior of participating ENT surgeons. METHOD: A pre- and post-intervention study in which the intervention (development and dissemination of local practice guidelines) was presented sequentially to different hospitals and surgical practices. The study was conducted with 16 consultant ENT surgeons and their junior staff on 1190 children aged 0 to 14 years on trial before consulting an ENT surgeon in four ear, nose and throat surgery wards in northern England. Patients referred for throat-related problems for which tonsil surgery is a possible treatment option were included in the study. Proportion of decision made by surgeons and decisions following new guidelines. RESULTS: Of the clinical decisions listing children for tonsillectomy before locally accepted guidelines were applied, 73% (486/660) met criteria in subsequent guidelines, 15% (97/660) did not, and 12% (77/660) It was impossible to judge. The corresponding figures after intervention were 73% (386/530), 14% (73/53) and 13% (71/530), respectively. When decisions were made to break the guidelines, it was more common to list tonsillectomy when not indicated—83% (141/170)—than stopping tonsillectomy when indicated—-17% (29/170). Aspects of the guidelines violated in tonsillectomy decisions were: the child was younger than the recommended guidelines - -54% (75/141)""; there were more tonsillitis episodes than the guidelines recommended-- 22% (32/141);"" and there were 'significant' symptoms not covered in the guidelines - 20% (29/141). CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong evidence to the contrary, local guidelines are formulated at a level already attained by the majority of surgeons. Therefore, guideline development and implementation has had little impact on clinical practice. The process of formulating guidelines locally was not sufficient to shift towards evidence-based practice"";"" The clinical choice has proven to be quite stubborn. There is a need to develop the skills of clinicians in evaluating and interpreting research evidence. Previous work has highlighted the need to explore factors influencing clinical behavior towards evidence-based practice. Our study shows that more research is needed as to why clinicians continue to follow clinical preference even when invited to base agreed local clinical policies on the evidence.",0,0,
956,"The Impact of Clinical Trial Results on National Trends in ÃŽÂ±-Blocker Prescribing, 1996-2002","Research on the factors influencing Context Prescribing patterns and the extent of change produced by clinical trial findings is limited. Purpose To examine changes in prescribing of α-blockers for the treatment of hypertension before and after the April 2000 publication of the early discontinuation of Adverse Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Therapy to Prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT), which included the doxazosin mesylate arm of the study. Changes in prescribing were evaluated in the context of other potential concomitant effects on drug use between 1996 and 2002, including changes in α-blocker drug prices, generic conversion, drug promotion, and competition. Design, Environment, and Patients Prescription orders for α-blockers using 2 national pharmaceutical market research reports published by IMS HEALTH have been reported in the National Prescription Audit - a computerized randomization of approximately 20,000 from 29,000 retail, independent and mail-order pharmacies and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index' It followed the patterns of bulk and discount homes and office-based physician a-blocker prescribing - a randomly stratified sample of approximately 3500 physician offices - reported in 2013. Outcome Measures Trends in physician-reported use of α-blockers and α-blockers prescribed and dispensed by US pharmacies. Results From 1996 to 1999, there were steady increases in new prescriptions for a-blockers, prescriptions given, and use of physician medication. There has been a moderate reversal in these trends following the early termination of ALLHAT and subsequent releases in the early 2000s. Between 1999 and 2002, new annual α-blocker prescription orders were 26% (5.15 million to 3.79 million), prescriptions were 22% (17.2 million to 13.4 million), and physician-reported drug use was 54% (2, decreased from 26 million to 1.03 million). While the cessation of inhibitory marketing accelerated the decline, other potential effects did not appear to have contributed significantly to this decline. Results Moderate but statistically significant reductions in the use of doxazosin and other α-blockers coincided with early termination of the ALLHAT doxazosin arm. Although physicians are responding to this new evidence, strategies to increase the impact of clinical trials on clinical practice are warranted.",0,0,
957,The effect of computerized decision support on blood pressure management and control: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND We conducted a cluster of randomized controlled trials to examine the efficacy of computerized decision support (CDS) designed to improve hypertension care and outcomes in a racially diverse sample of primary care patients. METHODS We randomized 2,027 adult patients receiving hypertension care in 14 primary care practices to 18 months of their physician receiving CDS for each hypertensive patient or usual care without computerized support for the control group. We evaluated guideline-recommended drug prescription and blood pressure control levels for patients in each group and, using interaction terms, examined whether the effects of the intervention differed by patients' race/ethnicity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blood pressure control rates were 42% at baseline and 46% at the outcome visit, with no significant difference between groups. After adjusting for patient demographics and clinical characteristics, number of previous visits, and baseline blood pressure control levels, there was no difference in outcome blood pressure control rates between intervention groups. Use of CDS to providers significantly improved drug prescribing based on Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines compared to usual care (7% vs 5%, P?<?0.001);"" the effects of the intervention remained after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio [ OR] 1.39 [CI, 1.13-1.72]) and the effects of the intervention did not differ by race and ethnicity of patients CONCLUSIONS CDS improved appropriate medication prescription with no improvement in disparities in care and overall blood pressure control.

958,The effect of decision support in electronic medical records on lipid management in primary care.,"Electronic decision support tools can help improve the management of hyperlipidemia and other chronic diseases. This study examined the impact of lipid management tools integrated into electronic medical records (EMR) in primary care practice. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of physicians using ambulatory EMR. Adult primary care physicians were randomized by the office to receive an electronic form embedded in the EMR. The form included requests for suboptimal care based on Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) guidelines, as well as reporting tools for identifying non-office visits patients with inadequate lipid management. All active patients aged 20-79 years, whose physicians participated in the study, were categorized as high, moderate, or low cardiovascular risk, and the proportion of those tested for hyperlipidemia, lipid target, and lipid-lowering drugs, if any. non-targets were measured according to ATP-III guidelines. A total of 105 physicians and 64,150 patients from 25 offices were included in the study. Outcomes improved for most measures from pre-intervention to 1 year post-intervention (November 1, 2005 - October 31, 2006). However, after controlling for confounding variables and clustering in multilevel modeling, only the current lipid test for high-risk patients was statistically better in the intervention group compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 15.0, P?<? 0.05). This study demonstrated little difference in the quality of lipid management after implementing an EMR-based disease management intervention in primary care settings.

959,The effect of EHR-based clinical decision support on compliance with guidelines for patients on NSAIDs: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) with clinical decision support show promise for improving quality of care, but their implications for the management of chronic conditions are mixed. This study examined the impact of EHR-based clinical decision support on compliance with guidelines for reducing gastrointestinal complications in primary care patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of primary care offices using an EHR and focused on patients taking traditional NSAIDs with a high risk of gastrointestinal complications (history of peptic ulcer disease; factors associated with concomitant use of anticoagulants). drugs [including aspirin] or corticosteroids or 75 years of age or older) Offices were randomized to receive EHR-based guidelines and alerts for high-risk patients receiving NSAIDs or usual care. was the proportion of patients who received appropriate care, defined as discontinuation of their traditional NSAID (including switching to a low-risk drug), or both.

In total, 165 participants studied a standardized patient, with one sample exposed to fresh fragrance (N = 79) and the other exposed to standard media (N = 86). Hand hygiene behaviors were monitored using video surveillance prior to patient contact. While the standard environmental group had 51% HHC, participants in the fresh fragrance group had an 80% higher HHC ratio (P < 0.001). These data suggest that hand hygiene behavior may be subconsciously influenced by environmental cues.",1,1,
961,The effect of environmental patient education on preventive medicine practices,"BACKGROUND: Research shows that provider-focused reminders alone are less effective at increasing physician compliance with prevention guidelines than combinations of patient- and provider-focused physician reminders. The effectiveness of environmental patient education (i.e. office-based videos, brochures, and posters) without individual staff or educator involvement has not been fully established. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental patient education in increasing the amount of preventive services that patients receive. METHODS: A nonrandomized controlled trial using historical controls was conducted in a model family medicine clinic at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque. The study group (n = 389) included adult women who were seen at the clinic at a time when educational materials were available in the waiting area. The control group (n = 381) consisted of similarly selected patients seen in the same period of the previous year in the absence of such material. During the intervention, patients in the waiting area were provided with educational materials encouraging them to ask their doctors questions about cholesterol testing, Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, tetanus vaccinations and mammograms. For both control and study groups, physicians' preventive service orders were tracked over a 4-month follow-up period by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: Despite sufficient statistical power, there was no statistically significant change in the number of cholesterol tests, Pap smears, tetanus boosters, or mammograms ordered after the environmental patient education intervention. CONCLUSION: Environmental patient education materials were not effective in increasing the amount of preventive services provided by physicians in this study. While such interventions are inexpensive, straightforward, and well-intentioned, they may be ineffective in improving the performance of preventive services.",0,0,
962,The effect of feedback and didactic sessions on the reporting behavior of upper endoscopic findings by doctors and nurses,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Guidelines for reporting Barrett's esophageal and hiatal hernia measurements and reflux esophagitis grades have been developed to improve consistency, communication, and ultimately patient care. Our aim was to evaluate the percentage of cases where findings were reported in accordance with guidelines and to assess the impact of education and feedback on reporting behavior. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study design was used. Chart reviews were performed for all adult patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy in a tertiary care center over three 2-month time periods at a 12-month interval: Time 1 (March 1, 2004 to April 30, 2004), Time 2 (July 1, 2004-August 31, 2004), and Time 3 (March 1, 2005-April 30, 2005). Standardized training sessions started 2 years before Time 1. No intervention was made between Time 1 and Time 2"";"" Data were collected to examine secular change. Individual and group feedback and refresher sessions were given between Time 2 and Time 3. RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred and nine appropriate esophagogastroduodenoscopy were performed and 2675 of them were found to have Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernia and/or reflux esophagitis. At baseline, measurements of Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia were accurately dictated as median in 67% and 86% of cases, respectively, and accounted for 100% (P < .05) and 98% (P < .01) of cases, respectively. ) rose. The Los Angeles Classification system was used in a median 100% of cases at baseline and at follow-up.

Adherence to the esophagitis Los Angeles Classification System is easy to maintain once it has been successfully incorporated into clinical practice.",0,1,
963,The effect of information leaflets on the behavior of patients with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis: a randomized cluster trial in French primary care.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of four patient information leaflets on patients' behavior in primary care. Design: Clustered randomized multicenter controlled trial between November 2009 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS: French adults and children who consulted a attending primary care physician and were diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis. Patients were randomized to receive or not receive patient information leaflets based on cluster randomization of primary care physicians. Intervention: Adult patients or adults accompanying a child diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis were informed about the study. Doctors in the intervention group gave patients an information leaflet about their condition. Two weeks after the consultation, patients (or their accompanying adults) answered a telephone questionnaire about their behavior and knowledge of the condition. MAIN MEASURES: Main and secondary outcomes, mean behavior and knowledge scores, respectively, were calculated from the responses to this questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-four physicians included 400 patients. Twelve patients (3%) were out of follow-up. In the group that received the patient information leaflet, patient behavior was closer to that recommended in the guidelines compared to the control group (mean behavior score 4.9 vs 4.2, p < 0.01). Knowledge was better for adults who received the brochure than for the control group (mean knowledge score 4.2 vs 3.6, p < 0.01). Patients who were given the leaflet had fewer visits by household members for the same symptoms (23.4% versus 56.2%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patient information leaflets given by the physician during the consultation significantly change the patient's knowledge of behavior and disease for the conditions examined, compared to patients who did not receive the leaflets.",0,0,
964,The impact of the application of rapid diagnostic testing for malaria on antibiotic prescribing: an analysis of observational and randomized studies in public and private healthcare settings.,"Objectives To examine the impact of the use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in prescribing antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics, for acute febrile illness in Africa and Asia. DesignÂ Analysis of nine preselected linked and co-designed observational and randomized studies (eight clusters or individual randomized trials and one observational study). SettingsPublic and private healthcare settings in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda, 2007-13 .To the participants 522â€â€°480 children and adults with acute febrile illness. InterventionsÂ Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria. Main outcome measuresÂ Proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics, with positive results in trial groups that passed rapid diagnostic testing compared to controls, and patients with negative test results compared to patients. A secondary objective was to compare classes of antibiotics prescribed in different settings. Results Antibiotics were prescribed to 127—052/238—797 (53%) patients and 167 in the control groups. ¬â€°714/283â€°683 (59%) patients in the intervention groups.

All but one study showed a trend towards more antibiotic prescriptions in groups undergoing rapid diagnostic tests. A random effects meta-analysis of trials showed that the overall risk of prescribing antibiotics in intervention settings was 21% higher (95% confidence interval 7% to 36%). In most intervention settings, patients with negative test results received more antibiotic prescriptions than patients with positive results for all of the most commonly used classes: penicillins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (an exception), tetracyclines, and metronidazole. ConclusionsÃ‚Â The introduction of rapid diagnostic testing could increase malaria use of non-targeted antibiotics to reduce unnecessary antimalarial use – a beneficial public health outcome. Prescribing antibiotics to 69% of patients when test results are negative likely represents overprescription. This includes antibiotics of various classes, including those such as metronidazole, which are rarely suitable for febrile illness in a variety of clinical, healthcare, and epidemiological settings. It is often assumed that better disease-specific diagnoses will reduce antimicrobial overuse, but they can simply shift it from one antimicrobial class to another. The current global application of malaria testing may increase non-targeted antibiotic use and should be examined.",0,1,

DESIGN: Controlled comparison study of an intervention group receiving intensive group training on the Mediterranean diet and a control group of hypercholesterolemic subjects given usual care by general practitioners (GPs). LOCATION: A socioeconomically deprived area of the Netherlands with a high mortality rate from coronary heart disease (CHD). SUBJECTS: Two hundred and sixty-six hypercholesterolemic subjects with at least two other CVD risk factors. RESULTS: After 52 weeks, the intervention group reduced total and saturated fat intake more than the control group (net differences 1.8% at (95% CI 0.2-3.4) and 1.1% at (95% CI 0.4-1.9), respectively) . According to the Mediterranean diet guidelines, fish, fruit, poultry and bread intake increased more in the intervention group than in the control group. In the intervention group, fish (+100%), poultry (+28%), and bread (+6) intakes increased significantly (P < 0.05) after 1 year. The intensive program on dietary education did not lower serum cholesterol more (-3%) than the published brochure (-2%) (net difference 0.06 mmol l-1, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.22). Initially, body mass index (BMI) decreased more in the intervention group, but after 1 year the intervention and control groups gained equal weight (+1%).

966,Impact of continuous drug lab monitoring alerts in outpatient care.,"Purpose: Intermittent stimuli in electronic applications can cause 'stimulus fatigue' if they are fired too frequently or only at certain times if clinically reasonable. We evaluated the impact of seamless, real-time drug lab alerts on provider lab test order. Design: We enrolled 22 outpatient treatments in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Clinics either used the existing system or took on-screen recommendations for basic laboratory tests when prescribing new drugs. Because the alerts were seamless, providers did not have to act on or approve the notification to complete a medication request. Measurements: Data were collected each time providers performed recommended laboratory tests within 14 days of ordering a new prescription. Results were adjusted for patient and provider characteristics and patient clustering within clinics. Results: Among the 12 clinics with 191 providers in the control group and the 10 clinics with 175 providers in the intervention group, there were a total of 3673 events for which basic laboratory testing would be recommended: 1988 events in the control group and 1685 events in the intervention group. In the control group, initial laboratories were requested for 771 (39%) of the drugs. In the intervention group, base laboratories were ordered by clinicians in 689 (41%) of cases. Overall, there was no significant association between intervention and the rate of ordering appropriate basic laboratory tests. Conclusion: We found that continuous drug laboratory monitoring alerts were not effective in improving the recommended baseline laboratory test monitoring for drugs. More work is needed to optimize compliance with non-critical recommendations.",1,1,
967,Effect of pharmacist-clinician dual intervention on prescribed benzodiazepines in inmate patients: a retrospective study.,"High-dose benzodiazepines (BDZs) represent an important risk factor for addiction, particularly in the prison setting. In Lyon prison, BDZs and/or opioid maintenance therapy are often prescribed to patients with mental disorders. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of psychiatrist and pharmacist collaboration on reducing the dose of BDZ prescribed to inmate patients. Since 2001, clinicians and pharmacists have held monthly meetings to develop prescribing guidelines and discuss patients taking high-dose BDZ. All psychotropic drugs prescribed for each patient included in the control (before guidelines) and intervention groups were noted. The criteria used to define each patient profile included age, diagnosis (mental disorder), and concomitant treatment (opioids, antidepressants). To compare each group, the daily dose of prescribed BDZs was used as a quantitative variable and expressed as diazepam equivalents. A total of 473 patients were included, 222 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. The two groups did not differ in terms of diagnosis. All patients (mean(CONTROL GROUP) = 46 mg diazepam equivalent vs mean(INTERVENTION GROUP) = 34 mg) and the control group had a higher daily dose of BDZ for each of the following patient categories: 'mental' impairment' (30 vs 48 mg) mg), 'no opioid therapy' (44 mg vs 31 mg), 'buprenorphine therapy' (58 mg vs. 63 mg), 'no antidepressant treatment' (41 mg vs. 29 mg) ) and 'antidepressant therapy' treatment' (53 mg vs. 38 mg). The results of this retrospective study demonstrate the positive effect of multidisciplinary intervention on reducing the prescribed daily dose of BDZ. This experience confirms the positive impact of pharmacist feedback on prescriptions and the development of treatment guidelines in collaboration with clinicians and pharmacists on improving prescribing practice in the prison setting.",0,0,
968,The Effect of Physician Asthma Care Education on Patient Outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of Physician Asthma Care Education, a continuing medical education program, in improving pediatricians' asthma management and communication skills and patients' use of healthcare services for asthma. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial at 10 sites in the United States. Primary care providers are randomly selected and appointed by the site to receive the program provided by local faculty. The program included 2 interactive seminar sessions (2.5 hours each) reviewing national asthma guidelines, communication skills and core education messages. The format included short lectures, case discussions, and video modeling communication techniques. We collected information on physician communication, the child's asthma symptoms, and patients' parental perceptions of asthma healthcare use. We used multivariate regression models to identify differences between control and intervention groups. RESULTS: A total of 101 primary care providers and a random sample of 870 asthma patients participated. After 1 year, we completed phone interviews with the parents of 731 of 870 patients. Compared with control subjects, parents reported that doctors in the intervention group were more likely to question patients' concerns about asthma, encourage patients to be physically active, and set goals for successful treatment. Patients of doctors participating in the program had a greater reduction in days limited to asthma symptoms (15.6 versus 8.5), as well as a reduction in emergency asthma visits (0.30 versus 0.55 visits per year). RESULTS: The Physician Asthma Care Education program was used in a number of locations and was effective in improving parent-reported provider communication skills, number of days affected by asthma symptoms, and asthma healthcare utilization. Patients who had more frequent asthma symptoms at baseline and benefited more from healthcare were more likely to benefit from their doctor's involvement in the program.",0,0,
969,Impact of regular collaboration between infectious diseases and intensive care practitioners on antimicrobial use and patient outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial management programs have been shown to help reduce the use of unnecessary antimicrobial agents in the hospital setting. To date, there is little data focusing on high-use areas such as the medical intensive care unit. When an infectious disease worker interacted regularly with the medical intensive care team, a prospective intervention was undertaken to assess guideline compliance, antimicrobial expenditure, and health care cost. DESIGN: A 3-month retrospective chart review was followed by a 3-month prospective intervention the following year. Two hundred and forty-six total charts were reviewed to assess generally accepted guidelines compliance, demographic characteristics, and microbiological outcomes. SETTING: Twenty-four-bed medical ICU in an 861-bed tertiary care, college teaching hospital in North Carolina. SUBJECTS: Patients receiving antibiotics in the medical intensive care unit. INTERVENTION: During the intervention period, the infectious disease specialist reviewed charts, including physician notes and microbiology data, and discussed antimicrobial use with the medical ICU team. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Antimicrobial use, duration of treatment, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment II scores, length of stay, mechanical ventilation days, and death rates were compared over the two periods. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were noted at baseline in the two groups (ie, age, gender, race, or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment II scores). Antibiotic indications included health-related (53%) and community-acquired pneumonia (17%). Significant reductions in broad-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0080), carbapenems (p=0.0013), vancomycin (p=0.0040), and metronidazole (p=0.0004) were seen following intervention. Antimicrobial modification caused an increase in narrow-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0322). The intervention group had a significantly lower rate of treatment not following the guidelines (p<0.0001). There was a reduction in mechanical ventilation days (p=0.0053), length of stay (p=0.0188), and hospital mortality (p=0.0367). The annual calculated healthcare savings were $89,944 for early antibiotic discontinuation alone. CONCLUSION: Active communication with an infectious disease practitioner can significantly reduce medical ICU antibiotic overuse by changing or discontinuing antibiotics earlier without increasing mortality. This, in turn, can reduce health care costs, encourage exceptional training, and strengthen relationships between subspecialties.",0,0,

In contrast, medical guidelines are intervention tools aimed at improving physician behavior and patient outcome. It can have positive effects as well as negative effects. Its effects should be tested by research. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 103 private practice psychiatrists were provided with either the WHO depression guideline only (information group) or the WHO depression guideline and were trained in this guide for one day (intervention group) or left uninformed. (control group). They then treated a total of 497 patients based on individual clinical considerations and patients' needs. Observation of routine treatment lasted for 12 weeks. Physicians and patients documented the course of the disease and treatment, including the patient-physician interaction. RESULTS: Psychiatrists in the intervention group saw more psychosocial stressors in their patients, prescribed higher doses of medication, discontinued less, and rated the treatment outcome as better. Ratings of patient-physician interactions indicated greater strain in their relationship. RESULTS: The results show both positive and negative effects of guideline exposure, but only in the training group, not the knowledge group. Guidelines must be experimentally tested before they can be called ""evidence-based"". Each guide should also explain how it can or must be applied to be effective.",0,0,

DESIGN Theoretically informed, case studies based longitudinal qualitative assessment. SETTING 12 'early adopter' NHS acute hospitals and specialist care settings were studied over two and a half years. DATA SOURCES Data were collected through in-depth interviews, observations and related documents directly related to case study sites and wider national developments considered to have an impact on implementation strategy. Data were analyzed thematically, first within cases and then between cases. The dataset consists of 431 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including hospital staff, developers and government stakeholders; From 590 hours of strategic meeting observations and the use of software in context; 334 sets of observation notes, researchers' field notes and notes from national conferences, 809 NHS documents and 58 regional and national documents RESULTS Implementation has progressed more slowly with a narrower scope and significantly less clinical functionality than originally planned. The national strategy has had important local consequences (summarized under five main themes). ) and wider national developments have greatly influenced implementation and adoption. More specifically, delays associated with unrealistic expectations about the capabilities of systems; the time required to build, configure, and customize the software; end users' needs for operational maintenance and training and support needed to ensure systems support provisioning. Other factors hindering progress include the changing environment of NHS policy and priorities; national conventions that have been repeatedly renegotiated; “different stages of development of various NHS care records service systems” and contractual arrangements that largely exclude NHS providers, as well as a complex communication process between different stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS The NHS Care Records Service is time-consuming and difficult to implement at “early adopter” sites, yet limited for clinicians it turned out to have no discernible benefits and no clear benefits for patients. Although our results may not be directly transferable. They shed light on the processes involved in later adopting sites, implementing major new systems, as the functions we evaluated were new and untested in the English context. The move was followed and welcomed by the NHS, but it is important that policy makers do not overlook the overall goal of an integrated interoperable solution.",0,0,
973,Implementation and success of nurse telephone counseling in linguistically isolated Korean-American patients with hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: Nurse telephone counseling may improve the management of chronic conditions, but the effectiveness of this approach in underserved populations is uncertain. This study evaluated the use of bilingual nurse-delivered telephone counseling in Korean Americans (PAs) participating in a community-based intervention trial to improve hypertension management. METHODS: PAs were randomized to receive 12-month hypertension-related telephone counseling that was either more intense (biweekly) or less intense (monthly). Consultation logs were kept for 360 PAs who completed their pre- and post-intervention assessments. RESULTS: The overall success rate of the intervention was 80.3%. Level of achievement was significantly influenced by mentoring dose, employment status, and years of US residency. During the 12-month counseling period, both groups improved in medication taking, alcohol consumption, and exercise, but without any significant group differences in non-smoking. CONCLUSION: Bilingual telephone counseling can reach monolingual PAs and improve hypertension management behaviors. PRACTICE PRACTICES: Bilingual nurse telephone counseling can have broad applicability, serving as an effective tool for disseminating evidence-based chronic disease management guidelines to a linguistically isolated population with limited health resources and knowledge.",0,0,
974,Appropriate trajectories for implementing a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings: managing tensions in rehabilitation care.,"While the importance of assessing relevance to the Background Application is recognized, little is known about the heterogeneity of fidelity over time. This study aims to generate insights into the heterogeneity of practice fidelity trajectories of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and its relationship with changes in patients' health behaviors. Methods This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-based physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Accuracy scores were calculated based on annual questionnaires completed by relevant professionals (n?=?Â¡Ã€?70). Higher fidelity scores indicate a more complete implementation of the core components of the program. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the application loyalty scores of 17 organizations at three different time points. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to explore institutional and professional differences between the identified trajectories. Regression analyzes were performed to identify differences in patient outcomes. Results Three trajectories were identified as follows: Â¡Â®stable high accuracyÂ¡Â¯ (n?=?9), Â¡Â®medium and incremental accuracyÂ¡Â¯ (n?=?6) and Â¡Â ®unstable fidelityÂ ¡Â¯ (n?=?2). Stable, high-loyalty organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and thriving loyalty organizations. At the beginning and end of the implementation period, support from physicians and physiotherapists, professional appreciation, and program compliance were rated more favorably by professionals working in stable high-loyalty organizations than moderate and growing-loyalty organizations (p ?<?.05). Qualitative data showed that stable, high-fidelity organizations generally have a clear vision and strategy for program implementation. Surprisingly, trajectories were not associated with self-reported physical activity outcomes (corrected model Â¦Â?=???651.6, t(613)?=???1032, p?=?.303). Results Differences in institutional-level application fidelity trajectories did not result in patient-level outcome differences. This demonstrates that an effective application fidelity trajectory depends on the circumstances of the local organization. More specifically, achieving consistently high implementation accuracy required the management of tensions: Realizing a localized vision of change while maintaining standardized core components of the program and involving scarce doctors throughout the process. As we scale up evidence-based health promotion programs, we propose to tailor the management of practice tensions to the starting position, size, and circumstances of local organizations.",0,1,
975,Implementation of a new policy results in reduced pressure ulcer frequency,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a new policy on the effectiveness of pressure ulcer care. DESIGN: A series of 1-day pressure ulcer questionnaires before and after administration. SETTING: A 900-bed University Medical Center in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: On the days of the survey, 657 patients were included before the application, 735 at 4 months after the application, and 755 at the 11 months after the application. INTERVENTION: Implementation of a hospital guideline for pressure ulcer care with the introduction of viscoelastic foam mattresses on the effectiveness of pressure ulcer prevention and treatment. MAIN RESULT MEASURES: Nurses' care behaviors and the frequency of pressure ulcer patients were compared before and after the application. RESULTS: Inadequate prevention decreased from 19% to 4% after 4 months and to 6% (P < 0.001) after 11 months, and undertreatment from 60% to 31% (P = 0.005). We found no significant increase in adequate care to prevent pressure ulcers when mattress use was excluded as a positive indicator for caregiving behavior. In addition, we did not find a significant difference in adequate treatment activities. Overall, we found a significant reduction in the frequency of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers from 18% to 13% (P = 0.003) after 4 months and to 11% (P < 0.001) after 11 months. CONCLUSION: The number of pressure ulcer patients in the hospital can be successfully reduced. General measures such as the introduction of adequate mattresses and prevention and treatment guidelines are promising tools in this regard.",0,1,
976,Implementation of an effective intervention for high-risk women in Mexico: protocol for a multisite randomized trial with a parallel study of organizational factors.,"Background Studies on the implementation of effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention interventions are rare, but important, especially in resource-constrained settings, because they have the potential to increase the effectiveness of interventions by improving uptake and sustainability. Few studies have focused on provider and organizational factors that may affect uptake and loyalty to key intervention components. Using a hybrid design, we will examine the implementation of an effective intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in 12 cities across Mexico. Our protocol will test a Â¡Â®trainer-trainÂ¡Â¯ implementation model to bring the Mujer Segura (Healthy Woman) intervention to community-based organizations (CBOs). Methods We partnered with the Mexican Foundation for Family Planning (Mexfam), a nonprofit with CBOs across Mexico. At each CBO, trained ethnographers will survey CBO staff about their organization's characteristics and attitudes towards their CBO and the implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Then, after CBO staff have collected a sample of 80 eligible FSWs and administered a standard of care, didactic intervention to 40 randomly selected women from this pool, a Mexfam staff member will be trained on the Mujer Segura intervention and then train other counselors to give birth. Mujer Segura, the remaining 40 participants to FSW. FSW participants will receive a baseline behavioral assessment and be tested for HIV and STIs (syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia)"";"" They will be reassessed six months after the intervention to measure possible intervention effects. At the same time, both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected on the implementation process, including the criteria for consultants' suitability for the intervention model. After data collection is completed in each CBO, the relative effectiveness of the Mujer Segura intervention will be analyzed and correlations between individual and institutional provider characteristics and intervention effectiveness among CBOs will be examined. Discussion This collaborative, binational research study will provide critical information on barriers and facilitating factors associated with the implementation of interventions in CBOs using the Â¡Â®train the trainerÂ¡Â¯ model. Our work builds on similar scale-up strategies that have been effective in the United States. This work has the potential to increase our knowledge of the generalizability of such strategies across health issues, national and institutional contexts.",0,0,
977,"Implementation of clinical guidelines through the electronic medical record: physician use, satisfaction and evaluation","CONTEXT: We developed and evaluated the Emergency Department Expert Table System (EDECS) to provide real-time guidance on low back pain in adults, fever in children, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids in healthcare workers. clinical guidelines within the electronic medical record. OBJECTIVE: To describe the behaviors and attitudes of physicians using EDECS. DESIGN: Pre-post questionnaires were used to assess physician attitudes. Time studies of the intervention phase were observational using clocks embedded in the software. PARTICIPANTS: Emergency, pediatrics, internal medicine and family medicine residents and interns and patients with the above-mentioned complaints. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician's use of EDECS, time spent on EDECS use, physician satisfaction and beliefs. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of the 142 eligible physicians used EDECS at least once. Five hundred and ninety-one (75%) of 789 eligible cases were completed using EDECS. The median session duration decreased from 12 minutes for the 1st session to 5.5 minutes for the 16th and above sessions. Doctors generally agreed that care with EDECS was better than standard care, especially in terms of documentation. However, there was significant heterogeneity in belief among complaints. CONCLUSIONS: These data illuminate both the potentials of computer-assisted decision making and the need for context-specific approaches when trying to implement guidelines.",0,1,
978,Implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of thromboembolism in spinal cord injury.,"Background/Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the publication of the “Prevention of Thromboembolism in Spinal Cord Injury” clinical practice guideline (CPG) changes patient management and whether adherence to CPG recommendations improves after a targeted delivery strategy. Methods: Data were summarized from the medical records of 1,34 and 520 patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), respectively, from 6 Veterans Affairs medical centers in 3 time periods: pre-release (T1), pre-administration (T2), and post-administration of CPG (T3). ). Targeted interventions were developed to address perceived provider-perceived barriers to guideline compliance, based on findings from focus groups conducted at each site. The interventions included two implementation strategies: standardized document templates/durable orders and social marketing/outreach visits. Results: Use of the specified time for pharmacological prophylaxis increased from 60% to 65% and 75% of patients with acute SCI at T1, T2 and T3, respectively (T1 vs. T2 and T2 vs. T3, respectively). for P = 0.060 and 0.041). ). Usage rates of individual pharmacological prophylaxis agents varied significantly throughout the study, with the use of low molecular weight heparin increasing from 7% at T1 to 42% at T3. On days 1 and 30 of hospitalization, physical assessments for thrombosis improved between T2 and T3. The use of prophylaxis in chronically injured patients with novel risk factors for thromboembolism increased from 16% to 31% and 34% during T1, T2 and T3 (P = 0.001 and 0.87, respectively). Results: The CPG broadcast had only a modest impact on the app. Use of structured practice further improved compliance with some CPG recommendations for thromboembolism prophylaxis. Similar implementation strategies should be considered for CPG recommendations with low adherence and high potential for morbidity and mortality.",0,1,
979,Diagnostic practice in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis: Diagnostic practice in asymptomatic patients with a record of aortic stenosis,"Often in clinical practice, some physicians refer patients with aortic stenosis for an invasive approach during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. This empirical behavior, which conflicts with the recommendations of current international clinical guidelines, is due to the perception that the prognosis of these patients is worse than if they were actually maintained. In fact, the management of asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is controversial, and there is no clear agreement on how to reduce the extreme clinical events associated with the presence of aortic stenosis mortality and morbidity in these patients in recent randomized clinical trials. The prevailing attention of the attending physicians is usually limited to the assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis and the appearance of symptoms, but instead it has been clearly demonstrated that the prognosis of these patients is associated with excessive left ventricular mass enlargement and increasing atherosclerosis. leads to coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke and death. Therefore, apart from markers of faster aortic stenosis progression, many other clinical and echocardiographic variables should be considered, pooled, and used in conjunction with clinical/echocardiographic prognostic scores recently validated by several authors in clinical practice, where the vast majority of these variables apply. Guilt was not taken into account at all. The Diagnostic Practice Registry in Patients with Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis is a prospective study designed to improve the diagnostic evaluation and prognostic classification of patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis.",0,0,
980,Implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation for nonspecific back pain and common mental health problems: a process evaluation of a nationwide initiative.,"BACKGROUND: The nationwide implementation of guaranteed access to evidence-based rehabilitation was established in Sweden in 2009 by an Act of the Swedish Government. The primary purpose of the rehabilitation guarantee was to increase the rate of return to work, reduce and prevent long-term absenteeism after diagnoses of back pain and common mental health problems. This study aims to develop knowledge about the factors affecting the large-scale implementation of complex and comprehensive interventions in healthcare settings. METHODS: In the collection and analysis of the data, three different data sources such as questionnaire, interview and document were used. Data were analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The following main facilitators contributed to the realization of the rehabilitation guarantee: financial incentives, project organization establishment, recruitment, in-service training and previous experience in similar projects. The barriers were: the short-term project form of the rehabilitation guarantee, the clinicians' attitudes towards return to work and their competence to work, the lack of guidelines defining treatment modalities in multimodal rehabilitation, and the lack of well-defined criteria for inclusion of patients. The documents revealed that the goal of return to work became less clear during the implementation process. Instead, care and health are more often described in documents used to disseminate information about the rehabilitation guarantee. The interim results found were: more adequate priority was given to patients in need of rehabilitation, greater readiness for future practice efforts, and overall competence and teamwork in psychotherapy, thus making it available to patient groups other than those covered by the rehabilitation guarantee. CONCLUSIONS: To facilitate the implementation of established national policy goals in clinical practice, there is a need for tools specifically aimed at changing clinicians' attitudes and behaviors regarding such goals. Our results highlight the importance of dedicating both time and adequate resources to activities and supporting the implementation process.",0,0,

982,Implementation of the Spanish version of European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention guidelines relies heavily on primary care physicians (PCPs) providing risk factor assessment, intervention, and patient education. The aim of this study was to determine the degree of awareness and implementation of the Spanish version of the European guidelines (CEIPC guidelines) on CVD prevention in clinical practice among PCPs. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of PCPs was conducted in Spain between January and June 2011. A random sample of 1,390 PCPs was taken and stratified by region. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: More than half (58%) of physicians were aware of and knew the recommendations, and 62% of them claimed to use them in clinical practice, with general practitioners (without specialist accreditation) being less likely than family physicians. Most PCPs (60%) did not assess cardiovascular risk, and the limited time available to surgery was cited as the biggest obstacle (81%). The main reason for skepticism about the recommendations reported by 71% of physicians was that there were too many guidelines. Nearly half of the doctors cited a lack of education and skills as the biggest barrier to implementing lifestyle and behavior change recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Most PCPs were aware of and knew the contents of the European directives on CVD prevention (CEIPC directives) to be adapted to Spain. However, only a third of PCPs used the guidelines in clinical practice and less than half of the CVD risk assessment tools used.",0,0,
983,"Implementation of NHLBI integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: rationale and study design for young hearts, strong starts, body mass index, blood pressure, and a cluster randomized trial targeting tobacco.","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and underlying atherosclerosis begin in childhood and their presence and intensity are associated with known cardiovascular disease risk factors. Attention to risk factor control in childhood has the potential to reduce the risk of subsequent CVD. OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Heads Strong Study was designed to test strategies that facilitate the adoption of Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: standardized dissemination versus multifaceted, practice-oriented intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited applications and provided support for intervention and outcome assessments. Individual practices were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups using a cluster randomized design based on network connectivity, number of clinicians per practice, urban and non-urban locations, and type of practice. Because measure compliance is abstracted from the individual patient's medical records, the observation units are individual children. Randomization units are physician practices. This results in a multi-level design where patients are nested within apps. Intervention practices received toolkits and supported guide practices, including academic elaboration, an ongoing e-learning group. This project complies with the American Board of Pediatrics Maintain Certification requirements, including monthly physician self-isolation, webinars, and other elements of the trial. IMPORTANCE: This trial will provide an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to improve CV prevention in children through guideline-based interventions.",0,0,
984,Implementation of the Tobacco Tactics intervention versus usual care at Trinity Health community hospitals,"BACKGROUND: A National Institutes of Health-sponsored study guided by the Access, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Care (RE-AIM) practice framework compared a nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention with usual care. A previous article describes the effectiveness of the Tobacco Tactics intervention. This next article provides data describing the remaining constructs of the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: This pragmatic study used a mixed methods, quasi-experimental design at five Michigan community hospitals, three of which were nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics interventions and two received usual care. Nurses and patients were surveyed before and after the intervention. Measures included access (patient participation rates, characteristics, and service uptake), adoption (nurse participation rates and characteristics), practice (pre- and post-training changes in nurses' attitudes, service delivery, barriers to practice, views on education, documentation of services, and volunteering). numbers of follow-up phone calls) and care (continuation of intervention after study ends). RESULTS: Reach: Patient participation rates were 71.5%. There were significant pre- and post-intervention increases (n = 1370, p < 0.001) in self-reported print material intake at intervention hospitals compared to no change in control areas. Adoption: All targeted units and a few non-targeted units in response hospitals joined"";"" 76.0% (n = 1028) of the targeted nurses and 317 additional staff attended the training, and 92.4% were highly or partially satisfied with the training. APPLICATION: Nurses in intervention hospitals reported increased availability of cessation advice, counselling, medications, worksheets and DVDs (all p < 0.05) and reduced barriers to the delivery of smoking cessation services (p < 0.001). Qualitative reviews were very positive (""user-friendly"", ""smoothed"" or ""saves time""), but problems were noted with showing patients DVD and charts in electronic medical records. Care: Nurses continued to provide the intervention after the study ended. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that nurses represent the largest group of front-line providers, this intervention that meets Joint Commission guidelines for the treatment of inpatient smokers has the potential to have broad reach and reduce smoking, morbidity and mortality among inpatient smokers. As we move towards more population-based interventions, the RE-AIM framework is a valuable guide to implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01309217.",0,1,
985,Implementation of a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain Evidence-based management in general practice (PRACTICE): cluster randomized controlled trial trial protocol,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from reliable studies is not often applied in clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential tool to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies for guideline dissemination concluded that there is a lack of evidence for effective strategies to promote guidelines adoption. Recommendations from this review and other studies have suggested the use of theory-based interventions because they may be more effective than those that do not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the treatment of acute low back pain has recently been developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based practice intervention for a common, high-burden situation where there is an evidence-practice gap in primary care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test the efficacy of a theory-based intervention for the implementation of a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary goals are to determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients referred for plain x-rays and improving the average disability level for patients three months after consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol details a cluster randomized controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters) comprising at least one consenting GP will be randomized to an intervention or control arm using restricted randomization. Patients 18 years of age or older visiting a participating GP for acute nonspecific low back pain of less than three months duration would be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited and a total of 2,300 patient participants will be provided. GPs in the control arm will gain access to the guideline using the current dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in face-to-face workshops supported by behavioral theory.

986,Implementation of a guideline for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes: results of a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT),"BACKGROUND: Many diabetic patients in Italy still lack adequate care in general practice. We evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies for implementing an evidence-based guideline for the management of uncomplicated type 2 diabetes among General Practitioners (GPs) in the Lazio region. METHODS: Three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with GPs as randomization units (clusters). 252 GPs were randomized to either an active strategy (training module including guideline management) or a passive extension (guideline application only) or usual care (control). Data on tests and drug prescriptions were collected by existing information systems, while data on patients came from databases of general practitioners. Process outcomes were measured at the cluster level one year after the intervention. Primary outcomes were related to the commissioning of glycosylated hemoglobin measurement and micro- and macrovascular complication assessment tests. Secondary outcomes were also calculated to assess physicians' medication prescribing behaviors. RESULTS: General practitioners identified 6395 uncomplicated type 2 patients with a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Data on baseline performance of GPs show evaluations of low rates of glycosylated hemoglobin. The results of the C-RCT analysis show that the active administration strategy was ineffective with respect to all primary outcomes (OR 1.06 [95% IC: 0.76-1.46]""; OR 1.07 [95% IC: 0.80-1.43];"" OR 1.4 [%] 95 IC:0.91-2.16] Similarly, passive dissemination of guidelines had no effect CONCLUSION: GP compliance in our region was not enhanced by a structured learning program that causes behavioral changes TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN80116232.",0,0,

988,Applying academic details to breast cancer screening in underserved populations,"BACKGROUND: African American and Hispanic women, such as those living in the North Manhattan and South Bronx neighborhoods of New York City, are often underserved in breast cancer prevention and screening practices, although they are more likely to die from breast cancer. than other women. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are critical in recommending breast cancer screening to their patients. Academic detailing is a promising strategy for improving PCP performance in recommending breast cancer screening, but little is known about the effects of academic detailing on breast cancer screening among physicians working in medically underserved areas. We evaluated the effectiveness of an advanced, multi-component academic elaboration intervention in increasing recommendations for breast cancer screening in a sample of community-based urban physicians. METHODS: Two medically underserved populations were matched and randomized to intervention and control arms. Ninety-four primary care community (ie, non-hospital-based) physicians in northern Manhattan were compared to 74 physicians in the South Bronx neighborhoods of the New York City metropolitan area. Intervention participants received doctor-directed advanced academic details using the American Cancer Society guidelines for early detection of breast cancer. No intervention was made in the control group physicians. We conducted interviews to measure primary care physicians' self-reported mammography and Clinical Breast Examination (CBE) recommendations and whether PCPs teach women to perform breast self-exams (BSE). RESULTS: Using multivariate analyses, we found a statistically significant intervention effect in recommending CME to female patients aged 40 years and older"";"" According to the physician's self-report, mammography and breast self-exam reports increased in both arms from baseline to follow-up.

989,Applying Best Evidence in Smoking Cessation Treatment for Hospitalized Veterans: Results of the VA-BEST Trial,"BACKGROUND: Although the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has promoted adherence to smoking cessation guidelines since 1997, hospitalized smokers do not receive ongoing assistance in quitting. METHODS: In a pre-guideline practice trial in inpatient medicine units of four VA hospitals, the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention (advanced academic elaboration, modification of the nursing admission template, patient education materials and referral to the dropout line, facilitation of administration, and staff feedback) changed practice behavior. Peri-charging interviews were conducted with 824 patients to assess whether nurses and physicians received the 5As (Ask, Advise, Evaluate, Help, Edit) in hospitalized smokers. RESULTS: Subjects were significantly more likely to receive each of the 5A from a nurse in the post-administration period (except for ""quit advice""). More patients were assisted to quit (75% vs. 56%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6, 3.1) and follow-up adjusted (23% vs. 18%, adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.2) by a nurse in the post-administration period. However, unadjusted results showed no improvement at seven-day point prevalence deprivation at six-month follow-up (13.9% vs. 13.5%). Nurses' self-efficacy in quit counseling improved following guideline implementation, as measured in a survey of 166 unit nurses. CONCLUSION: A multifaceted intervention involving advanced academic elaboration is an effective strategy to improve the delivery of smoking cessation services in inpatients. More intensive interventions are needed to ensure that motivated smokers receive the treatment recommended in the guideline (including pharmacotherapy and referral to outpatient cessation counselling) to promote long-term cessation.",0,0,

993,Implementation of evidence-based practice: the effectiveness of a structured multi-faceted mentoring program,"OBJECTIVE: This article is a report on the effectiveness of a structured multi-faceted mentoring program designed to implement evidence-based practice in a clinical research-intensive setting. BACKGROUND: Barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice are well documented in the literature. Evidence-based practice is associated with better quality care and better patient outcomes than traditional care. However, the integration of evidence-based practice into daily clinical practice remains inconsistent, and the gap between research and bedside practice remains significant. METHODS: This quasi-experimental mixed-methods study included pre-intervention (N = 159) and post-intervention (N = 99) questionnaires administered between June 2006 and February 2007, as well as a three-focus discussion with nursing leadership and shared governance staff. The online questionnaires included measures of organizational readiness, evidence-based practice beliefs, evidence-based practice practice, job satisfaction, group cohesion and nursing, and current turnover intention. Results. Participants in the evidence-based practice mentoring program had a greater increase in perceived organizational culture and readiness for evidence-based practice and belief-based practice scores than those who did not. The qualitative findings suggest that a culture of evidence-based practice must be a priority for the participation of staff at all levels, with leadership support and the allocation of resources for the sustainability of the initiative. CONCLUSION: These findings support other studies showing that nurses' beliefs about evidence-based practice are significantly related to evidence-based practice and having a mentor leads to stronger beliefs and more practice by nurses, as well as greater group cohesion. a powerful predictor of nursing turnover rates.",0,0,
994,Practice guidelines for depression on antidepressant prescribing in general practice: a quasi-experimental review.,"BACKGROUND: Internationally, depression guidelines recommend a stepped-care approach, implying that antidepressant medications should not be offered as first-line therapy to patients with below-threshold or mild depression. In the Netherlands, antidepressant prescribing rates are considered high in general practice as the first line of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of the guidelines for antidepressant prescribing. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent naturalistic control group and three-year follow-up was conducted in the Netherlands in a general practice setting. General Practitioners (GPs) participated in a national Quality Improvement Collaboration (QIC) focused on the implementation of a guideline-based model for a progressive care approach to depression. The model consisted of self-help and psychological treatment options for patients with milder symptoms as alternatives to antidepressants in general practice. Changes in antidepressant prescription rates of GPs were documented over a three-year period and compared to a control group of GPs selected from an ongoing network of national registries. RESULTS: There was a 23.3% (49.4%-26.1%) reduction in antidepressant prescribing rates for patients with newly diagnosed depressive symptoms in the intervention group, while there was no difference (50.3%-52.6%) in the reference group. The reduction over time was significant compared to the usual care group (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: An implementation program using tiered maintenance principles for the allocation of depression interventions resulted in lower rates of antidepressant prescriptions in general practice. GPs can change prescribing behavior in the context of a QIC.",0,1,
995,Implementation of guidelines on the prevention of opportunistic infections in inflammatory bowel disease,"INTRODUCTION: Opportunistic infections are an important safety issue in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the existence of international guidelines, many gastroenterologists have not adopted routine screening and vaccination. The aim of this study was to change clinical behavior using a simple screening tool. METHODS: A screening and vaccination proforma for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Influenza, Pneumococcus, human papillomavirus, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV was provided to each participating gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists were surveyed before and after the proforma was administered to raise awareness of vaccine recommendations and current practices. Immunity rates and the proportion of patients receiving recommended screening and vaccines were documented. RESULTS: Thirty gastroenterologists from 8 different IBD centers participated in the evaluation. A total of 919 patients were included (55% women, 65% Crohn's, 33% ulcerative colitis, 2% unspecified IBD). The introduction of Proforma increased self-reported gastroenterologist screening from 47% to 97% before and after intervention, respectively, p<0.001. After applying Proforma, hepatitis B, varicella, influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were recommended to 67%, 2.5%, 75% and 69% of the patients, respectively. Of these, 42%, 39%, 66% and 49% followed the recommendations and were vaccinated. Cervical smear was recommended in 31% and 62% of these received the recommended cervical smear. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a screening and vaccination proforma has significantly changed the self-reported behavior of gastroenterologists. Patient compliance with these recommendations was not optimal and suggests the need for more patient education in addition to other forms of support.",0,1,
996,Application of international osteoarthritis treatment guidelines in primary care: study protocol for the SAMBA stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Background Previous research shows that people with osteoarthritis (OA) do not receive recommended and optimal treatment. Based on international treatment recommendations and previous research for hip and knee OA, the SAMBA model for integrated OA care in Norwegian primary care was developed. The model includes patient OA training sessions led by a physical therapist (PT) and an exercise program lasting 8–12 weeks. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of a tailor-made strategy to implement the SAMBA model. Methods/design A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Norway in six municipalities (clusters) with a stepped wedge design that includes an impact, process and cost assessment. Municipalities will be randomly selected for the transition period from the current routine maintenance to the implementation of the SAMBA model, with a specific strategy. The specific strategy includes interactive workshops for general practitioners (GPs) and primary care PTs covering the SAMBA model for integrated OA care, educational materials, educational help visits, feedback and reminder material. Outcomes will be measured at patient, GP, and PT levels using self-report, semi-structured interviews, and record-based data. The primary outcome measure is patient-reported quality of care at 6 months follow-up (OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator questionnaire). Secondary outcomes include referrals to PT, imaging, and referrals to an orthopedic surgeon, as well as participants' treatment satisfaction, symptoms, level of physical activity, body weight, and self-reported and measured lower extremity function. Actual exposure to tailor-made implementation strategy and user experiences will be measured in a process assessment. In the economic evaluation, the difference in costs of usual OA care and the SAMBA model for integrated OA care will be compared with the difference in health outcomes and reported with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Discussion The results of this study will add to current knowledge about adapted strategies aimed at improving the uptake of evidence-based OA care recommendations and improving the quality of OA care in primary care. The new knowledge can be used in national and international initiatives designed to improve the quality of OA care. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02333656",0,1,
997,Implementation of nutritional guidelines -- the impact of systematic training for nurse nutrition practitioners,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 40% of patients admitted to hospitals are malnourished. Implementation of dietary guidelines can reduce the incidence of malnutrition and requires education and training for hospital staff. OBJECTIVE: It has been hypothesized that a training program focusing on staff behavior will increase the identification of eating difficulties, improve patients' knowledge of appropriate food choices, and increase the number of snacks eaten between meals, thereby reducing the risk of malnutrition. METHODS: Pre- and post-test design was used to evaluate the effect of the training program for nurses. The training was carried out in five modules over the course of 1 year and combined nutrition topics with topics related to practice and theories of planned change. The program was based on experiential learning theories and the look, think and act steps. The effect on patients was measured with a patient questionnaire. RESULTS: After following the guidelines, more patients discussed their eating difficulties with staff, received necessary assistance during meals, and were served food they ordered and could chew. Patients' knowledge of appropriate food choices from the menu increased, suggesting that patients' food intake improved. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a strategy based on the principles of experiential learning theory and the step-by-step model of look, think and act facilitates the implementation of nutritional guidelines in the hospital setting.",0,0,
998,Implementation of clinical guidelines using a computer graphics system. The effect on primary care of healthcare workers exposed to body fluids.,"Context. “Although clinical guidelines are seen as an important mechanism for improving the quality of medical care, problems in implementation can limit their effectiveness. Few empirical data are available on the impact of computer-based systems for the implementation of clinical guidelines on the quality of care. Aim. “To determine whether real-time delivery of clinical guidelines using the electronic medical record would improve compliance with guidelines. Design. Prospective closed-open, discontinuous time series with therapeutic analysis. Adjustment. â€”University hospital emergency department. Subjects Patients were 280 healthcare professionals (50 at baseline control, 156 at intervention, and 74 at post-intervention control) who presented for initial treatment of occupational body fluid exposure, including 89% (248/280). those who continued to be punctured and 81% (208/257) were exposed to blood. The doctors consisted of assistant doctors and doctors working in the emergency room during the study. interventions. - Implementation of a computer graphics system that provides real-time information on history and recommendations for laboratory testing, treatment and regulation based on rules derived from clinical guidelines. Main Outcome Measures. “The percentage of total fees and charges attributable to quality of care, compliance with testing and treatment guidelines, and guidelines-approved activities determined by key elements documented in medical records and post-care instructions.

999,Putting research findings into practice using clinical opinion leaders: barriers and lessons learned,"BACKGROUND: An opinion-leader-led intervention to improve practice guideline medication management for patients with schizophrenia was tested at four Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities. The concept of using evidence leaders as dissectors of research evidence and internal agents of change has been widely reported. PROJECT OVERVIEW: Each response site received an intensive, multi-component response over the course of a year. The process evaluation of the project included ongoing short surveys of doctors' attitudes and behaviors, diaries of reports from opinion leader conference calls, and interviews with opinion leaders towards the end of the implementation period. OBSTACLES OR PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Several barriers or problematic issues have surfaced: (1) doctors do not always agree on who is an opinion leader”; on some sites there may not be an opinion leader; (2) on some sites formal and informal social development networks among doctors; (3) focusing on doctors only as agents of change;"" and (4) how much instruction should opinion leaders be given on how attitudes and behaviors will be affected? DISCUSSION: The four main problematic issues encountered during the project offer potential solutions for addressing them.",0,1,
1000,Implementation of the NHS information technology programme: a qualitative study of progress in acute trusts.,"OBJECTIVES To describe progress and perceived challenges in implementing the NHS information and technology (IT) program in England. DESIGN Case studies and in-depth interviews with themes identified using a framework developed from grounded theory. We interviewed staff who had been interviewed 18 months ago or staff who just started the same job. SETTING Four NHS acute hospital trusts in England. PARTICIPANTS Senior trust managers and clinicians, including senior managers, IT managers, medical managers, and nursing managers. CONCLUSIONS The interviewees unconditionally supported the objectives of the program, but they had some serious concerns. As before, implementation is hampered by local fiscal deficits, delays in implementing program-compliant patient management systems, and poor communication between Connecting for Health and local administrators. New problems arose. Local authorities cannot prioritize program implementation because of competing financial priorities and uncertainties about the program. They perceive an increased risk to patient safety associated with delays and loss of integration of program components and are dissatisfied with Select & Book (electronic reservation for primary care referrals). CONCLUSIONS We recommend that the program set realistic timelines for individual trusts and advise administrators about temporary IT systems they have to purchase due to delays beyond their control. Advice should be mindful of the need for trusts for longer-term compatibility with the program and value for money. Trusts need help prioritizing IT modernization, including, for example, the implementation of the program within the framework of performance management. These issues will still need to be addressed, even as Connecting for Health takes a different approach to local practice versus centralized standards setting. Lessons learned in the NHS are of wider relevance as health systems such as France and Australia seek to realize the potential of large-scale IT modernisation.",0,0,
1001,Results of stroke prevention studies: treating global risk,"Clinical trials have shown that the risk of cardiovascular events can be reduced in stroke patients using blood pressure (BP) lowering and statin therapy, regardless of the presence of specific risk factors. These results suggest an alternative approach to secondary stroke prevention that focuses on global risk rather than identifying and modifying individual categorical risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. A risk-based approach is warranted because stroke patients are at high risk for many cardiovascular events, not just stroke, and physiological risk factors such as BP show a continuous or log-linear association with cardiovascular risk. What is necessary for the implementation of such an approach is the development of adequate risk stratification models for stroke patients. However, based on the limited available evidence, it appears that most patients with ischemic stroke or TIA are at high long-term absolute risk for a subsequent cardiovascular event and should be treated with all available risk reduction strategies.",0,0,
1002,Importance of characteristics and modalities of physical activity and exercise in defining cardiovascular health benefits in the general population: Recommendations from EACPR (Part I),"In the last decade, more and more evidence has accumulated that physical activity (PA) and exercise interventions are key components in primary and secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease. However, it is less clear whether which type of PA and exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance exercise, or both) or characteristic of exercise (frequency, intensity, duration or duration and volume) confer greater benefits in achieving cardiovascular health. . The first in a series of three articles, this article will provide specific advice on the importance of these traits for cardiovascular health in the population at large. The guidance provided in this series of articles is addressed to medical practitioners, health practitioners, kinesiologists, physical therapists and exercise physiologists, politicians, public health policy makers, and individual members of society. Based on previous and current literature, recommendations of the European Society for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation have been formulated regarding the type, volume and intensity of PA and exercise.",0,0,
1003,Improved asthma outcomes using a coordinated care approach in a large medical group.,"The aim of this study was to review the development of a multidisciplinary asthma disease management program in a large medical group practice in an urban area and to evaluate the impact of the program on care and healthcare utilization processes for adults and children with asthma. The disease management intervention included the development of a patient registry, a systematic approach to assessment of asthma control using the Asthma Treatment Evaluation Questionnaire (ATAQ), case management, and physician education. An administrative database was used to review hospital admissions and emergency room (ED) visits. A medical record audit was conducted to examine recorded compliance with asthma guidelines and documentation practices. The baseline study population included 3,486 adults and children with asthma. At baseline, the ATAQ suggested that control problems were common, with 34% of adult participants losing their jobs due to asthma. ATAQ also identified several areas for improvement of care. For example, only 20% of adult participants reported having a written treatment plan. Table review and analyzes of administrative claims showed that the program had beneficial results in several areas. Medical record documentation was improved for asthma diagnosis (83.3% vs. 98.6%”; p < 0.001) and patient education (15.7% vs. 26.1%; “p < 0.001). No improvement in peak flow ownership/use, smoking cessation advice, or flu vaccine documentation. Asthma-related emergency room visits decreased from 148 per 1000 to 88 per 1000 (p < 0.001) and asthma-related hospitalizations decreased from 81 per 1000 to 37 per 1000 (p < 0.001). The results show that this program is associated with a significant reduction in hospitalization rates and emergency room use rates for asthma, as well as significant improvement in several primary care processes.",0,1,

1005,Improved cardiovascular care (IDOCC) delivery through outreach facilitation: study protocol and implementation details of a cluster randomized controlled trial in primary care.,"BACKGROUND: There is a need to find innovative approaches to translate best practices for chronic disease care into daily primary care practice routines. Primary care plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease. However, there is a significant care gap and many challenges exist in the implementation of evidence-based care. The Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project is a pragmatic trial designed to improve the delivery of evidence-based care for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease using practical help facilitation in primary care. METHODS: The IDOCC project is a tiered cluster randomized control trial in which Practice Support Facilitators work with primary care practices to improve cardiovascular disease prevention and management for patients at highest risk. Basic care practices in a major health region in Eastern Ontario, Canada are eligible to participate. The intervention consists of regular monthly meetings with the Implementation Outreach Facilitator over a period of one to two years. Practices that begin with supervision and feedback, consensus building, and goal setting are supported in changing practice behavior by incorporating chronic care model elements. These elements include (a) evidence-based decision support for providers, (b) delivery system redesign for applications, (c) advanced self-management support tools provided to applications to assist patient engagement, and (d) applications to increase patient referral. The primary outcome is a composite score measured at the patient level to represent each practice's adherence to evidence-based guidelines for cardiovascular care. Qualitative analysis of Practicing Outreach Facilitators' written accounts of ongoing practice interactions will be made. These textual analyzes will provide further information to understand the critical factors affecting project implementation. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic, incremental, randomized controlled trial, which includes both quantitative and process assessments, demonstrates innovative ways to implement large-scale quality improvement and evidence-based approaches to care delivery. This is the first Canadian study to examine the impact of a large-scale, multifaceted cardiovascular quality improvement program in primary care. It is anticipated that through the evaluation of the IDOCC, we will demonstrate an effective, practical and sustainable way to improve the cardiovascular health of patients across Canada.

1006,Reduced surgical wound infections through improved perioperative antibiotic use and use of computer decision analysis.,"prospective study was conducted over a two-year period to determine whether computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use could improve prescribing habits and reduce postoperative wound infections. During the first year, baseline antibiotic use patterns and postoperative infection rates were determined. During the second year, computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use were placed in the patient's pre-operative medical records, and patterns of antibiotic use and postoperative wound infections were tracked. Hospitalized patients who underwent non-emergency surgery between June-November 1985 (3,263 patients) and June-November 1986 (3,568) were followed up for perioperative antibiotic use indications, timing of antibiotic use, and postoperative infectious complications. Perioperative antibiotic use was deemed appropriate for 1,621 (50%) patients in the 1985 sample and for 1,830 (51%) patients in the 1986 sample. Of these patients, 638 (40%) of the 1985 sample and 1,070 (58%) of the 1986 sample were given antibiotics two hours before the surgical incision (p<0.001). Overall, postoperative wound infection was detected in 28 (1.8%) of 1,621 patients in 1985, compared with 16 (0.9%) of 1,830 such patients in 1986 (p<0.03). We conclude that computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use improve prescribing habits with a concomitant reduction in postoperative wound infections.",1,1,
1007,Improved therapeutic monitoring with various interventions: a randomized trial.,"Background Medication errors are often associated with improper selection of medications or failure to adjust laboratory parameters. Differences between guideline recommendations and the actual frequency of therapeutic laboratory monitoring are significant. This study evaluated interventions to improve laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy. Methods This cluster randomized trial compared 3 usual care interventions for 10 drugs in 15 primary care clinics in a health care organization with an electronic medical record system. Eligible patients identified from electronic databases had not received the recommended laboratory monitoring within 5 days of new distribution of a study drug. The interventions included an electronic medical record reminder to the prescribing healthcare professional, an automated voice message to the patient, and a pharmacy team reaching out to the patient. The primary outcome was completion of all recommended baseline laboratory monitoring. Results A total of 961 patients participated in the study. At 25 days, 95 (48.5%) of 196 patients in the electronic medical record reminder group, 177 (66.3%) of 267 patients in the automated voicemail group, and 214 (82%) of 261 patients in the pharmacy team outreach group. 0) and 53 of 237 patients (22.4%) in the usual care group completed all recommended baseline laboratory monitoring (P<.001).

1008,Improving antibiotic prescription in outpatient care: a cluster randomized intervention study using a physician surveillance network.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of practice guidelines with individual feedback on the antibiotic prescribing behavior of primary care physicians in Switzerland. METHODS: One hundred and forty general practices from a representative Swiss sentinel network of primary care physicians participated in this cluster randomized prospective intervention study. The intervention consisted of providing guidelines for the treatment of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) and continuous, regular feedback on individual antibiotic prescribing behavior over 2 years. The main goals were: (i) to increase the percentage of penicillin prescriptions for all RTIs treated with antibiotics; (ii) to increase the percentage of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescriptions for all uncomplicated lower UTIs treated with antibiotics; (iii) to reduce all exacerbations treated with antibiotics. Percentage of quinolone prescriptions for COPD (eCOPD) cases; and (iv) reducing the rate of sinusitis and other upper respiratory tract infections treated with antibiotics Study registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01358916) RESULTS: Prescribed for sinusitis or other upper respiratory tract infections While the percentage of antibiotics and the percentage of quinolones prescribed for eCOPD did not differ between the intervention group and the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of penicillin prescribed for all GIs treated with antibiotics [57% vs. 49%, OR=1.42 (95%) CI 1.08-1.89), P=0.01] and trimethoprim/sulfa for all uncomplicated lower UTIs treated with antibiotics in percentage of methoxazole prescriptions [35% versus 19%, OR in the intervention group =2.16 (95% CI 1.19-3.91), P=0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, practice guidelines, combined with continuous individual feedback, did not reduce the rate of sinusitis and other upper respiratory tract infections treated with antibiotics, but increased the use of recommended antibiotics for respiratory infections and UTIs, as defined in the guidelines.",0,0,
1009,Improving hypertension management with structured physician education and feedback system: cluster randomized trial.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate whether hypertension management led to improved blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular outcomes with a structured physician information program and a feedback system. METHODS: Randomized cluster (3 : 1), open, followed-up, multicenter study in Germany. While primary care physicians in the information group (IG) received detailed training on hypertension guidelines, feedback on reaching target level, and a reminder to intensify therapy after each patient visit, the observation/control group (KG) did not receive any information. such measures. A three-level mixed model was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes, and non-parallel group-specific changes over time were tested. RESULTS: There were 15 041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients in IG and 4213 (21.9%) hypertensive patients in CG. At 1-year follow-up, 82.9% of patients in IG and 81.5% of patients in CG remained in the study. The guideline-focused BP target was achieved by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P = 0.03), while the individual BP target was achieved in 57.0% in the IG and 51% in the CG (P = NS). BP control in IG was achieved on average 2 months ago. Clinical inertia, defined as the absence of drug changes despite uncontrolled BP, occurred significantly less frequently in the IG group. One-year cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: Providing systematic information in conjunction with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves guideline adherence. Although the rates of hypertension control achieved were higher compared to previous studies, there is still significant room for improvement.",0,0,

1011,Improving compliance with hypertension drug prescribing guidelines: a clustered randomized controlled trial of general and patient-specific recommendations.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention that focuses the clinician's attention on drug selection for the treatment of hypertension improves compliance between drug regimens and guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with a general guideline application in geographically diverse primary care clinics of a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs health system. METHODS: Participants were 36 physicians and nurse practitioners (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group) based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A general practice of guidelines for all clinicians, including guideline-based medication recommendations and education about targets for adequacy of blood pressure control, was compared to the inclusion of a printed, individualized recommendation sent to clinicians at each patient visit that indicates whether the patient is on antihypertensive medication. regimen was consistent with the guideline. We measured the change from baseline to endpoint in the proportion of clinicians whose medication adhered to the guidelines. RESULTS: The individualized intervention resulted in an improvement in guideline adherence more than twice that observed for the overall intervention (10.9% vs. 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = .008). Bootstrap analysis showed that being in the individualized group increased the probability of compliance 1.5-fold (P = .025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control increased in each study group"";"" however, the difference between groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: An individualized advice on drug therapy for hypertension given to the clinician at each patient visit was more effective than applying a general guideline in changing the clinician's prescribing behavior.",0,1,
1012,Costly Improving Treatment Adherence and Clinical Outcomes: Opportunities for Greater Use of Generics: Best Practice Recommendations from the American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee,"Description: In the United States, the inconsistency between health expenditures and outcomes has fueled efforts to identify and address situations where unnecessarily expensive treatments are used when less costly, equally effective options are available. Inadequate use of generic drugs is an important example. Methods: A literature review was conducted to answer 5 questions regarding generic drugs: 1) How often are branded drugs used when a generic version is available? 2) How does the use of generic drugs affect compliance? 3) What is the evidence that brand-name and generic drugs have similar clinical effects? 4) What are the barriers to increasing the use of generic drugs? 5) What strategies can be used to promote cost savings through greater use of generic drugs? This article has been reviewed and approved by the American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee. Best Practice Recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe generics instead of more expensive brand-name drugs whenever possible.",0,0,

The rate of empirical antibiotic prescribing consistent with recommendations was examined over time by comparing pre- and post-periods and using a discontinuous time series analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, disease severity, and suspicion of aspiration, the odds ratio for compatible therapy during the academic elaboration period was OR = 2.79 [1.88, 4.14], p < 0.01, and computerized decision compared with baseline period. The duration of support compared to the academic elaboration period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02. During the first months of the computerized decision support period, an improvement in antibiotic prescribing eligibility was demonstrated, which was greater than expected to occur with time and academic elaboration alone, based on estimates from a binary logistic model. CONCLUSION: The deployment of a computerized decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices that was greater than the changes seen in academic elaboration. The sustainability of this intervention requires further evaluation.",1,1,
1014,Improving antibiotic use among hospital workers: a pilot academic detailing project with a public health approach,"OBJECTIVE: Inappropriate use of antibiotics is an important clinical and public health problem. We developed and implemented a pilot hospital-provided academic elaboration intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns for inpatients. OBJECTIVE: To improve antibiotic prescribing models in the hospital services of an academic medical center. DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT, AND PARTICIPANTS: Hospital staff were recruited to participate in this pre- and post-intervention pilot study at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC). Public health principles to create a conceptual framework based on behavior change theory were used in the development of the intervention. METHODS: The antibiotic prescribing patterns of 17 general practitioners working in the hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Antimicrobial prescriptions were classified as appropriate, effective but inappropriate or inappropriate. A profile was created for each hospital attendant and an academic elaboration intervention session was held. The session reviewed inappropriate prescribing practices and existing practice guidelines. After the detailing meeting, the prescribing patterns of the hospitals were followed prospectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were the proportions of inappropriately prescribed antibiotics before the intervention, during the elaboration period, and after the intervention. RESULTS: Seventeen hospital physician practitioners participated in the study. A total of 247 prescriptions were reviewed in the pre-intervention period and 129 prescriptions in the post-intervention period. Prior to academic elaboration, 43% (95% CI 37-49%) of prescriptions were appropriate and 57% (95% CI 51%-63%) were inappropriate. 74% (95% CI 65-81%) of post-intervention prescriptions were appropriate, 26% (95% CI 19-35%) were inappropriate"";"" P < 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: A carefully planned and methodically executed intervention can lead to behavioral change even among busy hospital workers. The academic elaboration intervention, which included a practice-based learning component, improved the antibiotic prescribing practices of hospitals at JHBMC.",0,0,
1015,Improving asthma care in emergency departments: results of a multi-hospital collaborative quality initiative in rural western North Carolina.,"BACKGROUND: In North Carolina, about a quarter of people with asthma go to an emergency room (ED) or emergency care center at least once a year because of an exacerbation of asthma symptoms. The Emergency Department Asthma Program was a quality improvement initiative designed to better understand the population of patients using emergency rooms to treat asthma in rural western North Carolina, and to demonstrate whether small hospital emergency departments can do this by implementing the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program treatment. Improve asthma care and reduce asthma-related emergency room visits. METHODS: Eight hospitals in western North Carolina participated in the project, which ran from November 2003 to December 2007. The response consisted of a series of individual and structured continuing medical education activities for emergency physicians and staff. In addition, patients presenting to emergency departments for asthma-related problems were selected to take a short patient questionnaire to determine their basic understanding of asthma and the barriers to asthma care; asthma staging by the treating physician; a respiratory therapist and finally, at the discretion of the treating physician, receive a complimentary pack of asthma medication before discharge, including rescue therapy with a beta-agonist and corticosteroid therapy delivered via a metered-dose inhaler. -monthly project, a total of 1,739 patients were delivered to participating emergency services for 2,481 asthma-related care episodes;""in 11% of these visits, patients received the intervention and approximately 100 emergency physicians referred patients to the program. and almost half were uninsured or covered by Medicaid. Only 20% of visits were to a primary care physician or practice. Patient intervention did not reduce the rate of repeat visits for asthma-related symptoms on days 30 and 60. LIMITATIONS: Patients enrolled in the study were in the target sample Since patients are more likely to be adults and insured, selection bias is possible.Since we did not measure the participation of emergency personnel in training sessions or their knowledge and attitudes about asthma care before and after the training program, we cannot draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the program in changing their knowledge, attitudes or behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients using the emergency department for care appear to have mild, intermittent asthma and do not identify a regular primary care source. Efforts to improve community-wide asthma care and reduce preventable exacerbations should include care provided in emergency rooms, as this may be the sole source of asthma treatment for many asthma sufferers. The project demonstrated that regional, collaborative performance improvement efforts in emergency services are possible, but there are many barriers to this approach.",0,0,

1019,Improving cardiovascular risk management: a randomized controlled trial on the impact of a decision support tool for patients and physicians.,"BACKGROUND: There is a suboptimal adherence of general practitioners (GPs) and patients to cardiovascular risk-reducing interventions. General practitioners find it difficult to incorporate multiple risk factors into an accurate cardiovascular risk assessment. Additionally, communicating cardiovascular risk to patients has proven difficult. OBJECTIVES: To improve primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care by increasing patient participation in the use of a decision support tool. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial. METHODS: Thirty-four GPs included patients (ages 40-75 years) without CVD. During the 4-hour interactive, small-group training session, GPs in the intervention group were trained to use cardiovascular risk guidelines and a decision support tool. The control group received educational materials about the guidelines on paper. Clinical performance of GPs and patients' perception of risk and self-reported lifestyles were measured at baseline and 6 months later. RESULTS: Thirty-four GPs recorded 490 consultations, of which 276 were in the intervention and 214 in the control group. After 6 months, the intervention had no significant effect on GP performance or on patients' perception of risk. It only had an effect on self-reported lifestyle, as more men in the intervention group increased their physical activity than the control group (probability ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.7-8.7). CONCLUSION: The 4-hour interactive, small-group training did not guarantee the correct application of the decision support tool and therefore failed to improve GP performance or correct patients' perception of risk.

1020,Improving care for minority children with asthma: vocational training in public health clinics,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that discontinuation of primary care for asthma is associated with increased levels of morbidity in low-income minority children. Although effective preventative treatment is available, many African-American and Latino children receive episodic treatment for asthma that does not follow current care guidelines. We trained staff at New York City Bureau of Child Health clinics to provide ongoing, preventive care for asthma to see if access, continuity, and quality of care could be improved in pediatric clinics serving low-income children in New York. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of the intervention over a 2-year period in a controlled study of 22 clinics. Training for intervention clinic staff was based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management and included screening to identify new cases and health education to improve family management. The intervention included strong administrative support provided by the Child Health Bureau to promote staff behavior change. We hypothesized that after intervention, clinics receiving the intervention would have an increased number of asthmatic children receiving ongoing care in clinics and staff use of new pharmacological and educational treatment modalities compared with control clinics. RESULTS: At both the first and second follow-up years, intervention clinics had greater positive changes in measures of access, continuity, and quality of care than control clinics. For second-year follow-up data these include: for access, higher proportion of new asthma patients (16/1000 vs 40/1000; P < .01); for continuity, greater percentage of asthma patients returning to treatment for 2 years at one year rank (42% vs 12%; P < .001) and greater annual frequency of scheduled visits for asthma per patient (1.85 vs. .88; P < .001) and greater percentage of patients receiving inhaled beta agonists for quality (52% vs 15%; P < .001) and inhaled anti-inflammatory drugs (25% vs 2%; P < .001) and greater percentages of parents (71%) who reported receiving patient education on 12 subjects from Bureau of Child Health physicians. vs 71%) 58%; P < .01) and nurses (61% vs 44%; ""P < .05).

1021,Improving chronic disease prevention and screening in primary care: results of BETTER pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Provides most of the evidence-based chronic disease prevention and screening services offered by the primary health care system. However, there is still a gap between recommended preventive services and actual implementation. This trial (BETTER Trial) aimed to improve preventive care of heart disease, diabetes, colorectal, breast and cervical cancers and related lifestyle factors through a practice facilitation intervention identified in primary care. METHODS: Practice of Primary Care Physicians as unit of allocation and pragmatic two-way factorial cluster RCT with individual patients as unit of analysis. The setting was urban Primary Care Team practices in two Canadian provinces. Eight Primary Care Team applications were randomly assigned to receive application-level intervention or waitlist control"";"" 4 doctors (32 doctors) from each team were randomly assigned to receive patient-level intervention or waiting list control. Patients randomly selected from doctor lists were divided into two groups: 1) general and 2) moderate mental illness. Interventions included a versatile, evidence-based, personalized practice-level intervention with a Practice Facilitator and a patient-level intervention that included a one-hour visit with a Prevention Practitioner, where patients received a specific 'prevention prescription'. The primary outcome was the combined Summary Quality Index of 28 evidence-based chronic disease prevention and screening actions with predefined goals, expressed as the proportion of appropriate initial actions met at follow-up. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 1,260 (63%) eligible patients, 789 participated. On average, patients were eligible for action at baseline of 8.96 (SD 3.2). In the adjusted analysis, control patients met 23.1% (95% CI: 19.2% to 27.1%) of the target actions, 55.6% (95% CI: 20.9% to 36.0%) compared to 28.5% (95% CI: 20.9% to 36.0%) who received the intervention. 95 CI: 49.0% to 62.1% receiving patient-level intervention and 58.9% (95% CI: 54.7% to 63.1%) receiving both practical and patient-level interventions (patient-level intervention vs. control, P < 0.001). The benefit of patient-level intervention was seen in both strata. The extra cost of the intervention was 26.43 CAN (95% CI: $16 to $44) per additional action covered.

Methods PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for intervention studies aimed at improving clinical transition among intensive care unit and general service health professionals, published up to June 2013. article inclusion and data analysis were predetermined and aligned with the recommendations outlined in the PRISMA guideline. Two reviewers independently extracted data (study objective, setting, population, sampling method, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcome and practice activities) and evaluated the quality of the included studies. Results Out of 6,591 citations originally drawn from six databases, we included 11 studies in this review. Six of these (55%) reported statistically significant effects. Effective interventions included liaison nurses to improve communication and coordination and coordination of care, and forms to facilitate timely, complete and accurate handover information. Effective interventions resulted in increased continuity of care (eg, reduced delay in discharge) and reduced adverse events. Inconsistent effects were observed for use of care, i.e. increased readmissions to higher care versus reduced length of stay. No statistically significant effect was found in reducing mortality. The overall methodological quality of the 11 studies reviewed was relatively low, with an average of 4.5 out of 11 points. Conclusions This review shows that liaison nurses and handover forms are promising interventions to improve the quality of patient handover between the ICU and the general ward. More robust evidence is needed on the effectiveness of interventions and supportive delivery strategies aimed at improving ICU turnover.",0,1,

No other intervention was made in the control group. Staff in the second group provided education to patients during their visit. In the third group, the prevention team used a flowchart, provided patient education, and redefined staff roles to facilitate compliance"";"" for vaccines, for example, nurses can vaccinate independently of the MD intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Medical records of 1202 patients seen, including 756 patients seen in both the 1988-89 and 1989-90 influenza seasons, were reviewed to determine the delivery and receipt of documented vaccines. During the intervention period (1989–90), influenza vaccines were offered significantly more frequently to prevention team patients (68.3%) than patients in the patient education (50.4%) or control (47.6%) groups (P = 0.006), with patients' prior immunization status , even after adjusting for age, sex, race and high-risk comorbidity, and level of education of physicians. Similarly, pneumococcal vaccines were recommended more frequently to previously unvaccinated prevention team patients (28.3%) than to previously unvaccinated prevention team patients (6.5%) or control (5.4%) patients (P = 0.001), even after adjusting for factors using multivariate analysis. Compliance rates did not differ between patient education and control subjects for either vaccine. Pre-intervention physician surveys documented perceived higher-than-actual compliance for both vaccines; 89.0% and 52.8% of physicians believed that they followed the influenza and pneumococcal vaccination guidelines, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this research provide strong support for organizational changes involving non-physician staff members to increase vaccination rates among older adults.",0,1,

1027,Improving physicians' prescribing behavior by reflecting on guidelines and prescription feedback: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to put research findings into clinical practice with guidelines or prescription feedback. OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact on prescribing quality through the combined intervention of deriving quality criteria using individual feedback and guideline recommendations in peer review groups. METHODS: 199 GPs in 32 groups were randomized to attend peer review meetings on asthma or urinary tract infections. Antiasthmatic medication and antibiotic dispensing by participating physicians during the year preceding the intervention period formed the basis for prescription feedback. Intervention feedback is designed to describe the treatment given in relation to recommendations in national guidelines. Based on these recommendations, physicians in each group agreed on quality criteria for their own treatment of related diseases. Comparing the prescription feedback with their own quality criteria gave each doctor the ratio of acceptable and unacceptable treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in prescribing behavior between the year before the intervention and the year after. RESULTS: Prior to intervention, the mean proportions of acceptably treated asthma patients in the asthma group and urinary tract infection (control) group were 28% and 27%, respectively. The average proportion of acceptably treated patients in the asthma group increased by 6% compared to the control group"";"" This difference was statistically significant. The mean rates of acceptable pre-intervention urinary tract infection treatments in the urinary tract infection group and the asthma (control) group were 12% for both groups, up 13% in the urinary tract infection group compared to the control group. Based on pre-intervention mean values, this represented a 21% improvement in treatment in the asthma group and 108% in the urinary tract infection group. CONCLUSIONS: Deriving quality criteria for prescribing by discussing guideline recommendations gave physicians a basis for evaluating their treatment for individual patients as acceptable or unacceptable. Along with feedback on their own prescriptions, they learned what they were doing right and wrong. This provided a foundation for improvement, and the process thus initiated resulted in doctors providing better quality patient care.",0,1,

Methods: We used a two-stage randomized study to compare antibiotics recommended by the antibiotic counselor with 482 associated antibiotic susceptibility results and physician-ordered concomitant antibiotics. Antibiotics ordered by randomized physicians were then compared between crossover periods of antibiotic consultant use. Results: The antibiotic counselor recommended an antibiotic regimen to which all isolated pathogens were susceptible in 453 (94%) of 482 culture results, while physicians ordered an antibiotic regimen to which all isolated pathogens were susceptible for 369 culture results (77%). ) (P<.001). Doctors who prescribed antibiotics to which all pathogens are susceptible did so on average 21 hours after culture samples were collected. Physicians ordered appropriate antibiotics within 12 hours of culture retrieval significantly more frequently than when using the antibiotic counsellor (P<.035). In addition, 88% of physicians stated that they would recommend the program to other physicians, 85% felt that the program improved their antibiotic selection, and 81% felt that using the program improved patient care.

1031,Improving feedback on young doctors' prescribing errors: a mixed-method evaluation of a quality improvement project.,"History Prescribing errors occur in up to 15% of inpatient drug orders in the UK. However, junior doctors report insufficient feedback on errors. One barrier to feedback is that individual prescribers are often not clearly identified in prescribing documents. Goal To reduce prescribing errors in a UK hospital by improving feedback on prescribing errors. Interventions Using plan-do-run-action cycles, we developed three linked interventions: (1) ""name stamps"" for junior physicians who are encouraged to clearly stamp or write their names when prescribing; (2) to support pharmacists in providing feedback to physicians on individual prescribing errors and (3) biweekly prescribing advice emails addressing a common and/or serious error Implementation and evaluation Interventions were initiated at a hospital site in August 2013 and served as a secondary control Process criteria , included the percentage of inpatient drug orders named by junior doctors, and included junior doctors' and pharmacists' perceptions of available feedback (assessed using quantitative preliminary surveys and post-questionnaires and qualitative focus groups), and erroneous writing by junior doctors between August and December 2013. was the prevalence of drug orders. Results Percentage The proportion of drug orders named by young doctors increased from about 10% to 50%. Survey responses revealed a significant improvement in the perceptions of pharmacists, but no significant change for physicians. Focus group findings suggested increased physician involvement with safe prescribing. Discrete time series analysis showed no difference in weekly prescribing error rates between baseline and intervention periods compared with the control region. Conclusion Findings suggest improved experiences with feedback. However, attempts to achieve a measurable reduction in prescribing errors are likely to require a multifaceted approach that should be part of the feedback.",0,1,

Patients' primary providers were randomized to 1 of 3 interventions in a stratified design: (1) control: provider training""; (2) provider and patient statement: computerized provider reminders and patient letters advocating ÃŸ-blockers;"" and (3) nurse facilitator: supervised nurse to initiate and titrate ÃŸ-blockers. The primary outcome, the proportion of patients initiated or upgraded to ÃŸ-blockers and analyzed for therapeutic purposes, was achieved in 67% (36 of 54) patients in the facilitating nurse group, compared to 16% (10). 64) in provider/patient reporting and 27% (14 out of 51) in control groups (P<0.001 for comparisons between the facilitating nurse group and both other groups). At study end (median follow-up, 12 months), the proportion of patients receiving target doses of α-blockers was highest in the nurse facilitator (43%) group (2%) compared to the control (10%) and provider/patient reporting groups (P<0.001). There was no difference between the groups in terms of adverse events. Conclusions – The use of a facilitating nurse was a successful approach to administer ÃŸ-blocker guidelines in heart failure patients. The use of provider education, clinical reminders, and patient education in this setting was of limited value.",0,1,
1033,Improving nurses' hand hygiene behavior using action planning: a pilot study in the intensive care unit and surgical ward.,"Compliance with hand hygiene guidelines by hospital doctors and nurses is universally low, and strong social science intervention methods are needed to increase compliance. One method is the creation of implementation intentions (or action planning) in which concrete 'what if' plans are formulated to relate an environmental cue to the performance of an intended behavioral action. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and effects of action planning on hand hygiene behavior (HHB) of nurses in the intensive care unit and surgical ward of a university teaching hospital. A pre-post test design was used and 17 nurses were invited to participate. A trained researcher observed nurses' HHB before and three weeks after the intervention for which action plans were formulated. Frequencies were calculated and logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate changes in HHB. Of the 17 participants, 10 (seven in the surgical ward, three in the intensive care) had complete data and were included in the analyses. A total of 283 potential moments for hand hygiene were identified, 142 in the surgical ward and 141 in the intensive care unit. HHB increased from 9.3% at baseline to 25.4% after intervention (odds ratio: 3.3""; confidence interval: 1.7-6.5;"" P<0.001). Although this is a small-scale study, the results hold promise for the use of action planning to improve nurses' HHB in the short term. Action planning has shown success in closing the intent-behavior gap in other areas, and its use to improve HHB in healthcare should be further explored.",1,1,
1034,Improving the transition from intensive care to ward health teams with simple changes in paperwork,"Medical handover has been highlighted as a critical step in patient care by the General Medical Council[1], enabling continuity of care, patient safety, and efficient multidisciplinary functioning. The handover of the doctors in the intensive care team and the service teams at the Great Western Hospital during the descent was evaluated by evaluating the discharge summaries and patient notes, and by following the discharged patients. Handover was found to exist only in a minority of patients and was not documented in any of them. Simple changes have been made to discharge paperwork in the form of a request and documentation of who is delivering the paperwork, as well as making room for patients with extraordinary handovers in the daily review pages. Initial audit findings were presented at a local meeting to remind staff of the importance of handover. These simple modifications brought the pass rates to 100% (n=12). The rates of handover documents also increased from 0% to 100%. This quality improvement project serves to demonstrate that carefully targeted, simple changes to practice in identified critical areas can produce dramatic and legally and ethically necessary results in a very short time.",1,1,
1035,Improving knowledge and changing behavior for guided decisions in diabetes care: a controlled intervention study of a team-based learning approach for continuing professional development of physicians.,"BACKGROUND: Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses should ideally enhance a physician's knowledge and shift professional behavior in daily practice towards a best clinical practice reference model and adherence to guidance. Compared to lectures, interactive methods such as team-based learning and case-based learning can provide sustainable information and high satisfaction among participants. We designed a case-based interactive CPD seminar on diabetes care using a team-based learning approach to assess whether it leads to behavioral change towards improving short-term knowledge and guided decisions, and how this learning approach is perceived by participants. . METHODS: Questionnaires and electronic voting system were used to evaluate the motivation, acceptance and knowledge of the volunteer participants. We also analyzed data on referral and index diagnostic testing of patients with diabetes by participating physicians over a six-month period before and after the course in comparison with a matched control group in a quasi-experimental design. RESULTS: Participants (n=103) rated interaction and team-based discussions as major drivers of enhanced learning. They also hoped that the course would change their professional behavior. Participants got an average of 43.9% correct answers before the course and 62.6% after the course (p<0.001). The rate of referral to a diabetes specialist increased by 30.8% (p<0.001). Applications for fundoscopy also decreased (8.5%, ns) in the control group. In addition, participating physicians tested their patients more frequently for microalbuminuria (7.1%, ns). CONCLUSIONS: Our team-based learning CPD approach has been highly accepted and has resulted in an increase in short-term knowledge. While significantly increasing referrals to diabetes specialists in daily practice, all other important indicators of professional behavior have changed, but not significantly.",0,0,
1036,Improving laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy in outpatient care: a randomized trial.,"Background The importance of laboratory monitoring for drugs is reflected in product labeling and published guidelines, but monitoring recommendations are followed inconsistently. There is an opportunity to improve monitoring with the potential to reduce treatment complications. Methods The purpose of this randomized study was to determine whether computerized stimulation was effective in increasing the percentage of outpatients with laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy. Doctors and pharmacists came together to develop organization-specific guidelines for monitoring selected drugs. In collaboration with physicians, pharmacists were alerted to missing laboratory test results, incomplete tests were ordered, patients were reminded to take a test, test completion was evaluated, test results reviewed, and abnormal results managed. Eligible individuals included patients initiating treatment for any of the 15 drugs out of 400,000 health plan members. Results In the intervention group, 79.1% (n = 4076""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 78.0-80.2%) of the distributions were observed, compared to 70.2% (n = 3522;"" 95% CI, 68.9-71.5%) %) in the usual care group (P<.001). For example, 78.6% (95% CI, 73.1% - 83.5%) of amiodarone was observed in the intervention group, compared with 51.4% (95% CI, 44.4% - 58.4%) in the normal care group (P<.001 ). Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a computerized tool, as well as collaboration among healthcare professionals in increasing the percentage of patients receiving laboratory monitoring at treatment initiation. Combining data from information systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can result in better patient follow-up.",0,1,
1037,Improving mammography recommendation: a nurse-initiated intervention,"We sought to improve our compliance with screening mammography recommendations for eligible female patients seen by family medicine residents, according to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines, using a multi-part intervention designed to remove relevant knowledge and behavioral barriers. residents. Copies of the ACS cancer screening guidelines were posted in all examination and conference rooms and provided to all residents. The intervention, which addressed behavioral barriers, had three components: (1) identification by nursing staff of eligible women who are overdue for mammograms at the time of their arrival for care, (2) a recommendation to complete a checklist showing whether a mammogram has been performed by residents and why, and (3) primary checklist A nurse-initiated backup reminder system for patients recovering from the system. A control of 200 pre-intervention and 270 post-intervention charts showed statistically and clinically significant increases in recommended or performed mammograms. Similar statistically significant increases were found in a cohort of 111 patient tables in both pre-intervention and post-intervention controls. The results suggest that an intervention designed to remove resident barriers to compliance with screening mammography guidelines can be effective in increasing recommended mammography rates.",0,0,
1038,Improving drug management in multiple morbidity: Development of the Multimorbidity Collaborative Drug Review and Decision Making (PASS) intervention using the Behavior Modification Wheel.,"Background: Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more chronic conditions, affects more than 60% of patients in primary care. Because of its relevance to multi-pharmacy, the development of interventions to optimize drug management in patients with multimorbidity is a priority. The Behavior Modification Wheel is a new approach to applying behavioral theory to intervention development. Here we describe how we used results from a review of previous research, our own original research and the Behavior Modification Wheel to develop an intervention to improve medication management in multimorbidity by general practitioners (GPs) within the comprehensive UK Medical Research Council. guidance on complex interventions. METHODS: Following the steps of the Behavior Modification Wheel, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative study with GPs to investigate behaviors associated with drug management in multiple morbidity. We chose one of the identified modifiable GP behaviors and conducted a focused behavioral analysis to explain why GPs engage in this behavior or not. We used behavior analysis to identify the intervention functions, behavior change techniques, and implementation plan that are most likely to influence behavioral change. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a number of modifiable GP behaviors in a systematic review and qualitative study that selected active drug investigation (rather than maintaining the passive status quo) as the target behavior. Behavioral analysis revealed GPs' abilities, opportunities, and motivations for active drug review. We created the Multi-Disease Collaborative Drug Review and Decision-Making ( MY HELP) intervention by combining the three intervention functions (influence, environmental restructuring, and incentive) thought to be most likely to influence behavior change. MY COMRADE primarily involves the technique of social support: two GPs jointly review medications given to a complex multimorbid patient. Four other behavior change techniques are included: restructuring the social environment, prompts/cues, action planning, and self-promoting. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to use the Behavior Modification Wheel to develop an intervention targeting multiple morbidity and validates the approach's usability and usefulness in a complex clinical care field. The systematic development of the COMPANY intervention will facilitate a comprehensive assessment of its effectiveness in the next phase of this study.",0,1,
1039,Improving mental health care transitions for children and youth: a protocol for the implementation and evaluation of an emergency department clinical pathway.,"Background Although the emergency department (ED) is often the first point of entry for children and youth with mental health (PD) concerns, its capacity to respond to OD needs in this setting is limited. Child OD systems are typically split between multiple ministries, organizations and providers. Communication between these groups is often poor, resulting in gaps in care transitions, especially for this vulnerable population. The evidence-based Emergency Department Mental Health Clinical Pathway (EDMHCP) was established with two main goals: (1) to guide risk assessment and regulatory decision-making processes for children and youth presenting to the emergency department with MD concerns, and (2) a community of MD agencies (CMHAs). and simplified transition to tracking services with other providers. The purpose of this article is to describe our study protocol for implementing and evaluating EDMHCP. Methods/design This mixed methods healthcare research project will include implementation and evaluation of EDMHCP in four exemplary ED-CMHA pairs. The Theoretical Domains Framework will be used to develop a specific response strategy to implement the EDMHCP. A multiple baseline study design and discontinuous time series analysis will be used to determine whether EDMHCP improves healthcare utilization, medical management of MD issues, and health sector coordination. The primary process outcome will be the proportion of patients with MD-specific recommendations documented in the health record. The primary service outcome will be the proportion of patients who receive the EDMHCP recommended follow-up 24 hours or 7 days. Data sources will include qualitative interviews, health record audits, administrative databases and patient surveys. A simultaneous process assessment will be undertaken to assess the degree of application variability and fidelity between sites. Discussion This article presents a new model for measuring the effects of EDMHCP. Our development process will determine how best to implement the EDMHCP among partner organizations to enable evidence-based risk management of children and youth with OD concerns. More broadly, it will contribute to the evidence supporting clinical pathway application in new partnerships.",0,0,
1040,"Improving opioid safety practices in primary care: protocol for the development and evaluation of a well-rounded, theory-informed pilot intervention for healthcare providers.","INTRODUCTION: In North America, drug overdose deaths are reaching unprecedented levels, largely due to the rise of prescription opioid-related deaths. Despite the development of several opioid guidelines, prescribing behaviors still contribute to poor patient outcomes and societal harm. Provider and system-level factors may hinder or facilitate the application of evidence-based guidelines"";"" interventions designed to address such factors are needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using applied science and behavior change theory, we planned to develop and evaluate a comprehensive Opioid Self-Assessment Package designed to increase compliance with the Canadian Opioid Guidelines among family physicians. The intervention uses practical training and self-assessment tools to provide feedback to prescribers on their current knowledge and practice, and to provide resources to improve their practice. The assessment approach uses a pretest and posttest design and includes both quantitative and qualitative methods at baseline and 6 months. We will draw a purposive sample of approximately 10 family physicians from various practice settings in Ontario who currently treat patients on long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Quantitative data will be analyzed using basic descriptive statistics and qualitative data will be analyzed using the Framework Method. ETHICS AND PUBLICATION: The University Health Network Research Ethics Committee approved this study. The dissemination plan includes publications, conference presentations and short stakeholder reports. This evidence-based, theory-based intervention has implications for national application of opioid quality improvement tools in primary care settings. We involve experts and end users in advisory and stakeholder roles throughout our project to increase national relevance, implementation and sustainability. Performance measures can be used as the basis for health system quality improvement indicators to monitor opioid prescription. In addition, the methods and approach used in this study can be adapted to other opioid guidelines or applied to other areas of preventive health and clinical guideline implementation processes.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General practices from two regions in the Sydney metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: 150 GPs recruited between 2006 and 2008 and 221 children with asthma in their care. INTERVENTION: General practitioners in the intervention group participated in two 3-hour workshops focused on communication and educational strategies to facilitate quality asthma care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient outcomes included obtaining a written asthma action plan (WAAP), appropriate medication use, parent absences from work, and child absences from school or childcare. GP outcomes included frequency of providing a WAAP and adherence to national asthma guidelines on patient education, communication and teaching behavior, and medication use. RESULTS: More GP patients reported receiving a WAAP in the intervention group (difference, 15%""; 95% CI, 2% to 28%; adjusted P=0.046). In the intervention group, less inhaled corticosteroids were used in children with infrequent asthma symptoms. use (difference, 24%; 95% CI, -43% to -5%; P=0.03) and long-acting bronchodilators (difference, 19%; 95% CI, -34 to -5%; P=0.02) GPs in the intervention group were more confident in communicating with patients (difference 22%; 95% CI, 3% to 40%; P=0.03). A higher proportion of GPs in the intervention group reported providing WAAP more than 70% of the time (difference, 23%; 95% CI, 11% to 36%; adjusted P=0.002) and prescribing spacer devices more than 90% of the time (difference, 29%; 95% CI, 16% to 42%; adjusted P=0.02 ).

1042,Improving Patient Care Through Medical Image Perception Research,"Interpretation of medical images in medical specialties is critical to patient care. Healthcare is changing as technology changes, and clinicians today are increasingly viewing medical images in a variety of settings. While access to such data is helpful, even clinicians skilled in image interpretation make mistakes. These errors may become more frequent as the clinician's working days get longer and the number of images to interpret increases. To avoid errors in medical image interpretation, we need to understand the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that guide image interpretation. We can then use what is learned to develop better training methods, automated image analysis and processing tools. We can design methods and develop practice guidelines to reduce clinician fatigue and stress, thereby improving patient care and outcomes.",0,1,
1043,Improve patient discharge and reduce hospital readmissions using Intervention Mapping,"Background There is a growing push to reorganize the hospital discharge process to reduce preventable readmissions and costs. The purpose of this study was to provide insight into hospital discharge problems and underlying causes, and to provide an overview of solutions that guide providers and policy makers in improving hospital discharge. Methods Intervention Mapping framework was used. First, a problem analysis was conducted examining the scale, causes, and consequences of ineffective hospital discharge. The analysis was based on primary data from 26 focus group interviews and 321 individual interviews with patients and relatives and relevant hospital and community care providers. Second, improvements were identified in terms of intervention outcomes, performance goals, and change goals. Third, 220 experts were consulted and a systematic review of effective evacuation interventions was conducted to select the theory-based methods and practical strategies needed to achieve change and better performance. Conclusions Ineffective discharge is related to factors at the level of individual caregiver, patient, relationship between providers, and organizational and technical support for caregivers. By focusing on high-quality discharge information, well-coordinated care, and direct and timely communication with colleagues, providers can reduce hospital readmission rates and adverse events. Patients or their caregivers should participate in the discharge process and be informed about their health status and treatment. Evaluating whether discharge information is accurate and understood by patients and their colleagues in the community by hospital care providers are important examples of overcoming identified barriers to effective discharge. Discharge templates, medication reconciliation, liaison nurse or pharmacist, regular site visits, and education are described as effective and promising strategies to achieve desired behavioral and environmental change. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive guiding framework for providers and policy makers to improve patient turnover from hospitals to primary care.",0,1,
1044,To improve the compliance of physicians with preventive medicine guidelines,"Similar general medical outpatient clinics with randomly assigned patients were used to evaluate the effectiveness of a program to increase home staff compliance with preventive medicine guidelines. Two clinical trials were determined and two served as controls. At experimental clinics, age-specific checklists of all recommended preventive procedures (taken from the Canadian Task Force report on Periodic Health Examination and American Cancer Society guidelines) are included in each patient's chart. In addition, housekeepers were offered a series of weekly seminars on screening issues alongside specific advice on the checklist. Housekeepers at four clinics were tested for their knowledge and attitudes towards the preventive program before and after the intervention. The numbers of immunizations and mammograms for the four clinics and the total populations eligible for these procedures were determined. As predicted, test scores as well as mammography and immunization rates increased significantly (from 2-40 percent) at intervention clinics compared to controls. We conclude that this intervention is clearly effective in the short term. However, follow-up studies will be necessary to determine whether the desired long-term effect is achieved.",0,1,
1045,Improving population-based cervical cancer screening in general practice: implications of a national strategy.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a Dutch national prevention program for general practitioners (GPs) on adherence to institutional guidelines for effective cervical cancer screening in general practice. To identify the characteristics of general practices that determine success. DESIGN: A prospective survey with pre- and post-measurement (before and 15 months after the introduction of the national programme). ENVIRONMENT AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of one-third of the 4758 Dutch general practice. A general practitioner was requested to attend for each application. INTERVENTION: A national GP prevention program to improve population-based prevention of cervical cancer at the national, regional and practice level, combining various modalities for quality improvement in general practice. Outreach visitors were a key strategy in bringing about behavioral changes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of practices that follow the 10 recommendations (four guidelines) for organizing effective cervical cancer screening. RESULTS: After 15 months, all Dutch practices showed significant improvement in adherence to nine out of 10 recommendations. In particular, the two recommendations 'identify women who should be medically excluded from screening' and 'send a reminder to those who are ineligible' showed the largest absolute increases of 26% and 33%, respectively. Implementation features such as 'computerization' and 'delegation of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant' were important in increasing adherence to guidelines, as well as greater support from outreach visitors. CONCLUSION: The national program, in which various methods are used together for quality improvement, seems to be effective in improving the organization of cervical screening in general practice. Computerization and, to a lesser extent, the transfer of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant and greater support for practices have positively impacted the effectiveness of the national program.",0,0,
1046,Improving Prescribing Patterns for the Elderly Through Online Drug Use Review Intervention,"Context."" Pharmacotherapy is among the most powerful interventions to improve health outcomes in the elderly. However, systems approaches to improving pharmacy care can be an effective way to reduce inappropriate drug use, as some drugs are less suitable for elderly patients. Aim."" To determine whether a computerized drug use review (DUR) database associated with a telepharmacy intervention could improve suboptimal drug use in the elderly. Design.â€” Population-based cohort design, April 1, 1996 - March 31, 1997. Setting.â€” Outpatient care. Patients.” A total of 23269 patients 65 years of age and older who received prescription drug assistance from a major pharmaceutical benefits manager in the United States over a 12-month period. Intervention.—Assessment of the prescribing provider through a computerized online database of STOP, using clear criteria to identify potentially inappropriate drug use in the elderly. Computer alerts triggered telephone calls to pharmacists trained in geriatrics, whereby the principles of geriatric pharmacology and therapeutic substitution options were discussed. Key Outcome Measures – Rate of contact with physicians and rate of change based on recommended medication regimen. Results.â€” A total of 43007 alerts were triggered. We were able to reach 3688 physicians regarding 24266 warnings (56%) out of a total of 43007 phone calls made up of the warnings. The conversion rate to a more appropriate therapeutic agent was 24% (5860), but ranged from 40% for long half-life benzodiazepines to 2% to 7% for drugs that are theoretically contraindicated by patient self-report. Except for the α-blocker exchange rate in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all exchange rates were significantly greater than the expected 2% change rate. Results.â€” Our large-scale intervention, using a system that integrates computers, pharmacists, and physicians, has improved prescribing patterns and quality of care, thus providing a population-based approach to advancing geriatric clinical pharmacology. Future research should focus on demonstrating improved health outcomes resulting from improved prescribing options for the elderly.",0,1,
1047,Improving quality improvement using accessible criteria for physician feedback: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Performance feedback and benchmarking, common tools for improving healthcare, are rarely studied in randomized trials. Achievable Benchmarks of Care (ABCs) are standards of excellence achieved by the best performers in a peer group and are easily and reproducibly calculated from available performance data. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of using achievable benchmarks to improve typical physician performance feedback and improve care. Randomized controlled trial conducted by the Design Group in December 1996 and followed up to 1998. Setting and Participants Seventy community physicians and 2978 paid-per-service Medicare patients with diabetes who are part of the Outpatient Quality of Care Project in Alabama. Intervention Physicians were randomly assigned to receive a multimodal remedial intervention, including chart review and physician-specific feedback (comparison group”; n = 35) or the same intervention plus achievable benchmark feedback (experimental group; n = 35) (1994) -1995) changes in the proportion of patients receiving the flu vaccine post-intervention (1997-1998); foot examination;"" and each of 3 blood tests measuring glucose control, cholesterol level, and triglyceride level compared between the 2 groups. Results The proportion of patients vaccinated against influenza increased from 40% to 58% in the experimental group (P<.001), from 40% to 46% (P = .02) in the comparison group. Odds ratios (ORs) for patients of available comparison physicians versus comparative physicians who received appropriate care after intervention, adjusted for pre-intervention care and placement of patients with physicians, were 1.57 for influenza (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.96) vaccine, foot 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.69) for the long-term glucose control measurement and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69) for the long-term glucose control measurement.

Conclusion The use of accessible benchmarks significantly increases the effectiveness of physician performance feedback in a multimodal quality improvement intervention setting.",1,1,
1048,Improving the quality of delirium care in a general medical service with established interdisciplinary care: a controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to improve the screening, prevention and management of delirium. OBJECTIVES: To apply delirium guidelines in general medical patients to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium and improve outcomes in delirium patients. METHODS: The practice was managed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and project staff in a single medical ward. Evaluation was conducted as a controlled trial in patients 65 years of age and older at risk/at risk of delirium compared to a control medical service. Interventions included risk screening, delirium detection, multidisciplinary training, ward modifications including a four-bed delirium compartment, behavior and medication protocols, and the use of nurse aide and volunteers. Primary outcome measures were incidence and duration of delirium"";"" secondary outcomes were length of stay, mortality, falls, and discharge goal in the insane subgroup. Process measures included ward movements, use of neuroleptics, ancillary health review, and use of delirium bay. RESULTS: Of the 206 consenting elderly medical patients, 22% were insane at presentation and 44% were at risk. No delirium case was detected. In the insane subgroup, significantly fewer intervention participants were discharged with persistent delirium (32% vs. 71%, P = 0.016), reductions in inpatient mortality (18.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.07), and falls (P = 0.07) 11 vs 22) %, P = 0.16), at the expense of a longer medical service stay (16 days vs. 8 days, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of new delirium may reflect the established interdisciplinary care environment. The improved outcomes in the insane group, including increased length of stay in the acute department, are encouraging, although costly to implement.",0,0,
1049,Improving residents' compliance with outpatient care standards: results of the VA Cooperative Study on Computerized Reminders.,"Context Computerized systems that remind physicians to provide appropriate care have not been widely evaluated in large numbers of patients in multiple clinical settings. Purpose To examine whether a computerized reminder system working in multiple Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinics improves resident's compliance with outpatient care standards. Design, Environment, and Participants A total of 275 resident physicians at 12 VA medical centers were randomly assigned to a reminder group (n = 132) or a control group (n = 143) in firms or half-day clinical blocks. During a 17-month study period (January 31, 1995 – June 30, 1996), residents looked after 12,989 unique patients for whom at least 1 of the studied standards of care (SOC) was applicable. Main Outcome Measures Compliance with the 13 SOCs monitored using hospital databases and encounter forms filled by residents was compared between residents in the reminder group and residents in the control group. Results The reminder group, which measures compliance as the proportion of patients who met all applicable SOC at their last visit during the study period, had statistically significantly higher compliance rates for all standards than the control group (58.8% vs 53.5%; odds ratio [OR] ], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.42; P = .002) and Measuring Adherence for 5 of the 13 standards reviewed separately, as the proportion of all visits at which resident provided appropriate care, the reminder group also had statistically significantly higher concordance rates for the standards than the control group (17.9% vs. 12.2%; OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.45-1.71; ""P<.001), and 9 out of 13 standards were analyzed individually . However, the usefulness of the reminders declined over the course of the study, although the reminders remained active. Conclusions Our data shows that reminder systems installed at multiple sites can improve resident compliance to multiple SOCs. However, the benefits of such systems appear to deteriorate over time. Future research needs to explore methods to better maintain the benefits of reminders.",0,1,
1050,Improving smoking cessation counseling using a point-of-care health response tool (IT): from the Virginia Practice Support and Research Network (VaPSRN),"OBJECTIVE: Primary care practices are an ideal setting to reduce national smoking rates, as >70% of smokers visit their doctor annually, but smoking cessation counseling is inconsistently communicated to patients. We designed and built a new software program for handheld computers and hypothesized that it would improve clinicians' ability to provide tailored smoking cessation counseling at the point of care. METHODS: A handheld computer software program was created based on smoking cessation guidelines and an adaptation of widely accepted theories of behavior change. The instrument was evaluated using a validated pre/post questionnaire to measure the physician's smoking cessation counseling behaviors, knowledge, and comfort/self-efficacy. RESULTS: Participants were recruited from 17 physicians (mean age 41 years”; 71% male;” 5 resident physicians) from a practice-based research network. After 4 months of use in direct patient care, physicians were more likely to recommend patients to quit smoking (P = .049) and reported an increase in ""5 As"" use (P = .03). There was increased self-efficacy (P = .006) in counseling patients about smoking cessation and increased comfort in maintaining patients' follow-up (P = .04).

1051,Improvement of test sequencing in primary care: added value of small group quality improvement strategy compared to classical feedback only,"OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate the added value of small peer group quality improvement meetings compared to simple feedback as a strategy to improve test order behavior. The number of tests required by primary care physicians is increasing, and many of these tests appear unnecessary according to established, evidence-based guidelines. METHODS: 194 primary care physicians from 27 local primary care practice groups in 5 health regions (5 diagnostic centers) were enrolled. The study was a cluster randomized study with randomization at the local physician group level. We evaluated an innovative, multifaceted strategy combining written comparative feedback, group training on national guidelines, and social influence by peers in small-group quality improvement sessions. The strategy addressed 3 specific clinical issues: cardiovascular problems, upper abdominal complaints and lower abdominal complaints. The mean number of tests per physician at baseline at 6 months and the region of physicians were used as independent variables, and the mean number of tests per physician at 6 months was the dependent variable. RESULTS: The new strategy was applied in 13 primary care groups, while 14 groups received feedback only. For all 3 clinical subjects, the reduction in the average total number of tests ordered by physicians in the intervention arm was much more significant than the decrease in the average number of tests ordered by physicians in previous years (an average of 51 fewer tests per physician per half-year). feedback lever (P = .005). Five tests considered inappropriate for the clinical problem of upper abdominal complaints were reduced in the intervention arm, and physicians in the feedback arm ordered 13 more tests at 6 months (P = .002). Inter-physician variation in test sequence was further reduced in the intervention arm. CONCLUSION: Compared with distributing only comparative feedback reports to primary care physicians, the new strategy involving peer interaction and social influence improved the test ordering behavior of physicians. To be effective, feedback must be integrated into an interactive, educational environment.",0,1,

Publishing guidelines often fails to change professional behavior due to multiple barriers. Structured practice can improve adherence to guidelines. This article describes the design of a study that measured the impact of an e-learning powered Train-the-Trainer program aimed at training a full staff of departments in the implementation of the guideline. We assume that both professionals and departments will benefit from the program. METHOD: In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 43 psychiatry departments spread across 10 regional mental health institutions across the Netherlands will be clustered in pairs according to the most common diagnosis category of patients and mean duration of treatment. Pair members are randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. In the experimental condition, the full staff of the departments, i.e. all registered nurses, psychologists, doctors and psychiatrists (n = 532, 21 departments) will be trained in the application of the guideline in a small one-day interactive group. -Trainer program. The program is supported by a 60-minute e-learning module with video sketches of suicidal patients and additional instructions. In case of control (22 departments, 404 professionals), the manual will be distributed in the traditional way: manuals, books, conferences, internet, reviews, etc. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated both at the level of health professionals and departments. DISCUSSION: In the implementation of a new clinical guideline, we aim to demonstrate the impact of training all personnel of the departments with an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program. The strengths of the study are the natural environment, the training of the full staff, the random allocation of conditions, the large scale of the study, and the willingness of both staff and management to participate in the study.

1053,Improving the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in primary care after implementation of a local antimicrobial guideline at both levels of care,"Purpose This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of multiple interventions during the implementation of a guideline for improving the relevance of antimicrobial prescribing in primary care. Design This is a before/after cross-sectional study conducted in the Aljarafe Health Area (Andalusia, Spain) with a population of 368,728 assisted in 37 health centres. Subjects Subjects include patients who were prescribed antibiotics by simple random sampling (confidence level, 95%"";"" accuracy, 5%) during 2009 (pre-intervention phase) or 2012 (post-intervention phase) and whose infections were recorded in the electronic clinical history. Interventions This study included training sessions in primary care centers and hospital services, incorporation of the electronic manual on Healthcare Websites, and the inclusion of the Digital Health History manual as a tool to support decision making. Main conclusion The difference in appropriate antibiotic prescribing before and after interventions resulted from the study. Other variables also include age, gender, type of pharmacy, antibiotics prescribed, number of treatments per year, site of infection, and major comorbidities. Results The percentage of appropriate antibiotic prescribing increased from 36% in 2009 to 57% in 2012 (p?<?0.001). Improvement was observed in patients of all ages, of any gender, and was higher in patients of working age and patients with comorbidities. The best results were observed in the beta-lactam group and in the treatment of respiratory and skin infections. Conclusion Performing multifactorial interventions involving professionals from both care levels can be an effective strategy to improve the use of antimicrobials in primary care.",0,1,
1054,Improving the care of people with acute low back pain by allied health professionals (ALIGN trial): A cluster randomized trial protocol.,"Background Variability between clinical practice guideline recommendations and actual clinical practice exists in many areas of health care. A 2004 systematic review examining the effectiveness of guideline implementation interventions concluded that there is a lack of evidence to support decisions about effective interventions to encourage the adoption of guidelines. In addition, the review recommended the use of theory in the development of practice interventions. A clinical practice guideline for the treatment of acute low back pain was developed in Australia (2003). Acute low back pain is a common condition, has a high burden, and there are some indications of an evidence-to-practice gap in the ancillary healthcare setting. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based practice intervention that, if effective, could have benefits for patients with this condition. Objectives This study evaluates the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase compliance of allied health practitioners (physiotherapists and chiropractors in Victoria, Australia) with a clinical practice guideline for acute nonspecific low back pain (LBP) practitioners with a printed copy of the guideline. Specifically, our primary goals are to determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients with acute nonspecific LBP who are referred for or received an X-ray and improve the average disability level for patients three months after initiation of therapy. acute LBP. Methods The design of the study was a cluster randomized trial. Restricted randomization was used to randomize 210 treatments (clusters) to an intervention or control group. Practitioners in the control group were given a hard copy of the manual. Practitioners in the intervention group received a theory-based intervention developed to address prospectively identified barriers to practitioner compliance with the guideline. The intervention consisted primarily of an education symposium. Patients 18 years of age or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute nonspecific LBP of less than three months duration during a two-week data collection period three months after the intervention symposium are eligible for inclusion. Sample size calculations are based on taking 15 to 40 patients per administration. Outcomes evaluators will be blind to group allocation.",0,1,
1055,"Improving hypertension management in Kazakhstan: implications for improving clinical practice, patient behavior and health outcomes","This article presents findings from the evaluation of a strategy aimed at improving case finding and management of patients with hypertension. The study findings suggest that universal access by providers to clinical guidelines, publicly available information on hypertension risks, the promotion of annual blood pressure screening, and an outpatient medication aid package improves case finding and management. Additionally, training of service providers at the pilot facilities resulted in a significant and significant difference in patient care and health outcomes. Provider education and tools, particularly focused on effective patient counseling, have made significant contributions to case finding, patient adherence to prescription medications, reducing salt and increasing regular exercise. However, further improvement is needed to ensure patients' expected compliance with medication and lifestyle advice. In the pilot area, we compared two patient samples before and after the start of the intervention. We found an increase in the proportion of patients with blood pressure or = 160/100 mmHg.

1056,Improving the outcome of bipolar disorder with non-pharmacological strategies: the role of psychoeducation,"This article discusses the effectiveness of psychoeducation and related strategies in bipolar disorders. Recently, several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of psychological interventions—that is, identification of prodromal symptoms, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and family-focused interventions—as a prophylactic add-on to drug therapy. All these studies are presented here together with the pioneering studies in the field. There are several topics that every psychoeducational program must include in order to be useful, and these will be summarized in twelve points. Roughly, psychoeducation should include general information about bipolar illness, elements of improving compliance, teaching early detection of relapses, and lifestyle regularity. Many treatment guidelines today include psychoeducation as an important prophylactic tool. Clinicians should be aware of this and begin psychoeducation in their daily clinical practice.",0,0,
1057,Increasing the success of mailed letter intervention programs to influence prescribing behaviors: a review,"BACKGROUND: Educational interventions have long been used as a way to influence prescribing behavior. A variety of techniques including educational mailings, academic elaboration, prescriber feedback with or without disclosing patient-identifying data, and additional patient information have been used to encourage proper prescribing habits, reduce costs, and optimize patient care. While the effects of educational intervention programs have been widely reported, little is known about the effectiveness of the various intervention techniques sent by mail. OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of mail-in intervention programs and identify factors that can promote successful outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed for reports of posted intervention programs published up to May 2012. Specific search terms such as ""drug use review"", ""medication use"", ""Medicaid"", ""prescribing feedback"", ""mailed doctor response"" and ""mailed doctor communication."" Certain publications were selected for inclusion that met the following criteria: (a) evaluated printed educational materials distributed by mail, (b) took place in an outpatient setting, and (c) measured the impact of the intervention on prescribing patterns, healthcare utilization, or economics. results. Papers meeting all 3 criteria for intervention strategy, follow-up time, data source, goal of intervention, prescriber acceptance of intervention and impact on prescribing patterns, health care use, and economic outcomes are summarized. RESULTS: A total of 40 published reports on 39 unique interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies (34/39 [87.2%]) were conducted in state or federally funded programs""; only 5 programs included private insurers. All programs used </=12-month follow-up periods after final response mailing. 26' out of a total of 39 unique interventions 20 reported a positive effect on at least 1 target outcome. Programs involving a second recipient, such as pharmacists (n = 4), reported a greater effect than interventions sent to prescribers only. had a high success rate (21/25 [84.0%] and 5/14 [35.7%]); non-patient-descriptive materials also used academic elaboration. Educational material and/or prescriber feedback on multiple drug classes or disease states. programs had minimal impact on prescribing patterns (n = 4). However, targeting 1 specificity was supported by ic disease or appropriate evidence. drugs resulted in positive changes in a short time. Additionally, providing recommendations supported by widely accepted clinical guidelines or literature has also been associated with a high success rate. A subset of programs attempting to assess healthcare utilization (n=5) and economic impact (n=9) observed little change in measured outcomes. Evaluation of prescriber response forms conducted by 7 programs revealed that changes in treatment occurred in approximately 50% of prescribers who sought to accept intervention recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: A well-structured mail-in intervention program appears to have the potential to induce significant changes in prescribing patterns, although the degree of heterogeneity between articles precludes definitive conclusions. Prescribers seem open to mailed interventions,"" however, limited data exist to determine the relationship between acceptance and actual prescribing change. Future research should focus on identifying barriers that may prevent acceptance of recommendations from translating into changes in therapy. Additionally, future projects will consider duration of action and duration of action after the final intervention mail. longer evaluation periods to determine the potential impact on health care and economic outcomes.",0,1,
1058,Improving the use of early follow-up care after emergency room visits. A randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the appropriateness of parents' use of early follow-up care after emergency room (ED) visits can be improved with post-visit support from a nurse practitioner. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, single-blind. SETTING: Urban university hospital Emergency Department is connected to the primary care center of the hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 190 children younger than 8 years of age seeking emergency care for acute illnesses and receiving outpatient care with primary care center follow-up at the discretion of emergency department clinicians. INTERVENTION: Parents in the experimental group were contacted by a nurse practitioner who offered both individualized guidance on follow-up and access to a nurse for further assistance as needed. The control group received ""as usual"" follow-up advice during emergency room visits. MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: In the week after ER visits, parents in the experimental group were more compliant with follow-up instructions (61% vs. 79%), were less likely to miss appointments (15% vs. 31%), and less likely to ""shop"" elsewhere for care (2% vs. 9%). Appropriateness of monitoring was assessed in a 'blind' fashion using predetermined guidelines. Inappropriate use of follow-up care was significantly reduced among experimental group subjects (10% vs. 20%). CONCLUSION: The intervention of the nurse practitioner improved the parental use of follow-up care in our sample. Overall care for episodic emergency room users can be improved with similar interventions.",0,0,
1059,In the warm defense of population health: doctors and antibiotic resistance,"Antibiotic resistance threatens the population as a serious public health threat and costly social problem. Recent recommendations to tackle antibiotic resistance largely focus on supply-side approaches. Proposals include tampering with patent rights so that pharmaceutical companies have greater incentives to discover new antibiotics and resist overselling their newer drugs already on the market. This article argues that a primarily supply-side emphasis, unfortunately, distracts physicians from important demand-side effects. Physicians have a vital and inevitably necessary role in ensuring optimal societal access to antibiotics. Sadly, doctors' management of the supply of antibiotics was poor, and their defense of public health was lukewarm at best. Acting as a prudent representative of the antibiotic supply often appears to conflict with a physician's generally understood mandate duties, ethical obligations, and professional norms; all of which traditionally emphasize the individual health paradigm as opposed to community health responsibilities. Meanwhile, physicians face limited incentives to conserve antibiotics from other sources, such as malpractice liability, regulatory standards, and reimbursement systems. While multi-pronged efforts are needed to effectively combat antibiotic resistance, physician surveillance behavior should become a primary focus area. This article considers how health law and policy tools can positively change the incentives physicians face for antibiotic preservation. A clear lesson from the recent battles for managed care reform is that to have the best chance of success, interventions must respect the physician's interest in clinical autonomy and individualized medicine, even if, somewhat paradoxically, strongly encourages population health perspectives. In addition, physicians' legal and ethical obligations need to be reconceptualized in the context of antibiotics to better support gatekeeping in advocating for public health. The main recommendation is to use more financial incentives to reward physicians for complying with recommended guidelines for prescribing antibiotics. While not a panacea, further experimentation with financial incentives could provide a much-needed jump start to physicians' interest in antibiotic containment and possibly best address physicians' legitimate clinical autonomy concerns.",0,0,
1060,Addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy to usual care was cost effective at 1 year in treatment-resistant depression,"Question Is it cost-effective to add individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to usual care in primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression? Method Design Cost-benefit analysis based on 1-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (CoBalT trial) from the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. Identifying primary care practices in Bristol, Exeter and Glasgow, UK. Patients Â¡Ã 469 patients aged 18 to 75 years (mean age 50 years, 72% women) who had been on antidepressant medication for 6 weeks but continued to have depressive symptoms, were diagnosed with depression using the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule and a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) )-II score Â¡Ã 14. Intervention Individual CBT, 12 to 18 hour sessions in primary care settings or similar settings, plus usual care (n = 234) or usual care alone (n = 235).

Results Treatment response (Â¡à 50% reduction in BDI-II score)""; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on EQ-5D-3L scores and quality-of-life assessments from the UK general population; costs in GBP 2010 {UK Â¡Ãª1 = $1.56}*;"" and increased cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs include NHS and PSS costs from primary care registries, CBT therapist registries and patient surveys. Follow-up was 83% to 84% for clinical outcomes at 1 year and 78% for health and social care costs. Main results Addition of CBT to usual care reduced symptoms of depression and increased QALYs (Table). CBT plus regular care with 14 911 ICER (23 261) ICER per QALY earned over 12 months is more expensive than regular care alone (Table). In sensitivity analyzes using the Short Form-6 dimensions algorithm to estimate QALYs, the ICER was 29 626 (US$ 46 217). Conclusion In primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression in the UK, the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to usual care was cost-effective at 1 year.",0,0,
1061,Inclusion and exclusion criteria from randomized controlled trials of psychotherapy for PTSD,"OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and often disabling condition. Fortunately, effective psychological treatments for PTSD are available. However, research shows that these treatments may not be used adequately in clinical practice. One reason for this underuse may be that clinicians unfairly exclude patients from these treatments based on their understanding of the exclusion criteria used in clinical trials of psychological treatments for PTSD. There is no comprehensive and up-to-date review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of psychological treatments for PTSD. Therefore, our aim was to better understand how patients are excluded from such RCTs to provide clinicians with guidance on clinical populations likely to benefit from these treatments. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of RCTs on psychological treatments for PTSD from January 1, 1980 to April 1, 2012. We categorized these clinical trials according to the types of psychotherapy discussed in the main guidelines for PTSD treatment and reviewed all treatments. studied in at least two RCTs (N=64, published study with 75 intervention arms, because some studies have compared two or more interventions). We summarized and tabulated information on exclusion criteria for each type of psychotherapy for PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple RCTs for PTSD that included cognitive behavioral therapy (n=56), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (n=11), and group psychotherapy (n=8). The most common exclusions were psychosis, substance abuse and addiction, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation. Clinical trials varied in how strictly these criteria were applied. It is important to note that no exclusion criteria were used in all studies, and at least one study was found for each type of therapy that included patients from each of the commonly excluded groups. There is little evidence for the treatment of patients with PTSD and its four comorbidities: alcohol and substance abuse or current addiction, current psychosis, current mania, and current intentional suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments for PTSD have been studied in large and representative clinical populations. It seems that more liberal use of these treatments is warranted regardless of comorbidities.",0,0,
1062,"INCOG recommendations for cognition management following traumatic brain injury, part III: executive function and self-awareness","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in complex cognitive (and other) sequelae. Impairments in executive function and self-awareness are among the most characteristic neuropsychological sequelae and can have a profound impact on maintaining previous life roles. An international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) came together to develop recommendations for interventions to improve impairments in executive function and self-awareness after TBI. METHODS: The team reviewed the available literature and ensured that the recommendations were up to date. To support the implementation, the team developed decision algorithms with recommendations based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of published trials. The team then prioritized the practice recommendations and developed audit criteria to evaluate adherence to the best practice recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention programs that include teaching metacognitive strategies for planning, problem solving, and other cognitive-executive disorders have a solid evidence base. New evidence supports the use of strategies specifically to improve reasoning skills. Significant support is available for the use of direct corrective feedback to develop self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increasing number of scientifically well-designed studies demonstrating the effectiveness of various interventions for the correction of impairments in executive function and self-awareness after TBI.",0,0,
1063,Enhanced Compliance with Antibiotic Prophylaxis Guidelines to Prevent Pediatric Surgical Site Infection: Before and After the Study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an intervention to improve antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) guideline compliance to prevent surgical site infections in children. BACKGROUND: Although appropriate AP reduces surgical site infection and guidelines improve quality of care, it is difficult to change practice. Various barriers need to be addressed to facilitate behavior change. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force at a children's hospital developed an evidence-based FP guideline. Later, the guideline was published in ORs and online formularies, only recommended antibiotics were available in ORs, incoming trainees received orientation, time-out antibiotic validation was included, computerized alerts were set for inappropriate postoperative prophylaxis, and surgeons received email. -Emails sent when the directive is not followed. The indication and practice of AP was documented for surgical procedures in July 2008 (pre-intervention), September 2011 (post-intervention), and April-May 2013 (follow-up). Compliance full--appropriate antibiotic, dose, timing, re-dosing, and duration” when prophylaxis is indicated; partial--appropriate medication and timing when prophylaxis is indicated; and appropriate use--full compliance, no antibiotics when prophylaxis is indicated Pre-intervention and follow-up compliance chi (2) tests. RESULTS: AP was noted in 43.9% (187/426) and 62.0% (124/200) of surgical procedures before and during follow-up Appropriate antibiotic use (51.6%-67.0%) ; P < 0.001), there were significant improvements in complete (26.2%-53.2%; P <0.001) and partial compliance (73.3-88.7%, P = 0.001), correct dosage (77.5%) -90.7%; P = 0.003), timing (83.3%-95.8%; P = 0.001), redosing (62.5%-95.8%, P = 0.003), and duration (47.1-65%) ,3;""P < 0.002).

1064,Improving compliance with low tidal volume ventilation in the intensive care unit with two nudge-based interventions: evaluation through intervention time series analyzes,"OBJECTIVES: Low tidal volume (TVe) ventilation improves outcomes in ventilated patients, and most clinicians report doing so. Unfortunately, most patients never get low TV. 'Nudges' affect decision making through subtle cognitive mechanisms and are effective in many contexts. Few studies have examined its effects on clinical decision making. We investigated the impact of 2 interventions designed using behavioral science principles on the deployment of low TVe ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). SETTING: University Hospitals Bristol, a 20-bed tertiary care, mixed medical and surgical ICU, admits over 1300 patients per year. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 2144 patients who received more than 1 hour of controlled mechanical ventilation between October 2010 and September 2014. Patients who underwent controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS: (1) Default ventilator settings were adjusted to meet low TVe targets from the start of ventilation unless actively changed by a clinician. (2) A large dashboard has been placed that displays the TVs in mL/kg ideal body weight (IBW) format with warnings when the TVs are excessive. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: TVe in mL/kg IBW. RESULTS: TVe was significantly lower in the defaults group. In the panel intervention, TVe dropped faster and more after exceeding a TVe of 8 mL/kg IBW compared to controls. This effect improved with each subsequent year for 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that setting default ventilator settings and a dashboard with excessive TVe alerts can significantly affect clinical decision making. This offers a promising strategy for improving compliance with low TVe ventilation and suggests that using insights from behavioral science has the potential to improve the translation of evidence into practice.",1,1,
1065,Increasing the quantity and quality of seeking the best available evidence to answer clinical questions: protocol and intervention design of the MacPLUS FS Factorial Randomized Controlled Trials,"Background and objectives Finding the best available evidence for clinical decisions remains difficult. With 3,000 new studies published every day, no single evidence-based source can provide all the answers or be adequately updated. McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service - Federated Search (MacPLUS FS) addresses this issue by simultaneously looking at multiple high-quality sources and displaying the results in a one-page pyramid, with the most clinically useful at the top. Still, additional logistical and educational barriers need to be addressed to improve point-of-care evidence access. This trial aims to test three innovative interventions among MacPLUS FS-registered clinicians to increase the quantity and quality of seeking the best available evidence to answer clinical questions. Methods and design Using a user-centered approach, we designed three interventions built into MacPLUS FS: (A) a web-based Clinical Question Recorder; (B) an Evidence Coach with eight short training videos; (C) an Audit, Feedback and Gamification approach to collecting evidence based on the allocation of 'badges' and 'reputation points'. We will conduct a randomized factorial controlled trial among all 904 eligible medical practitioners currently enrolled in MacPLUS. FS in hospitals affiliated with McMaster University, Canada. Graduate trainees (n = 429) and clinical faculty/staff (n = 475) will be randomized to each of the following three interventions in a factorial design (A x B x C). Usage will be recorded continuously through clinician accounts that monitor login and usage down to the level of individual keystrokes. The primary result is the monthly search rate per user over the six-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes, measured through the Validated Impact Assessment Methodology questionnaire, include the usefulness of the answers found (meeting clinicians' information needs), use (practical application), and perceived benefit on patient outcomes. Discussion Building on effective models for point-of-care teaching, these interventions come close to acquiring evidence as a clinical skill. If effective, they can provide better access to relevant evidence across multiple top-level CPA resources in parallel, providing an opportunity to develop at a low cost for a broad audience.",0,0,

1068,Individuals with low back pain: How do they view physical activity?,"BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for those with acute low back pain advocate early resumption of normal activity and increased physical activity. Little is known about the relationship between low back pain and physical activity, and the impact this relationship has on promoting increased levels of physical activity in the general practice population. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the relationship between the factors affecting changes in physical activity and individuals' perception and behavior of low back pain, and the effect of these perceptions and behaviors on physical activity. METHODS: Twenty-seven sources of information were selected using a purposive sampling from a larger group of individuals who were referred by family physicians to a population-based, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) for low back problems. University of York evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a progressive exercise program. Fifty-four interviews were conducted with this subgroup of the RCT"";"" four of them were interviewed once, 19 of them twice and four of them three times. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using manual and computer-assisted approaches. RESULTS: Physical activity was perceived as (i) activities of daily living, (ii) activities that caused shortness of breath and stopped doing, and (iii) more competitive type of activity. Avoidance of physical activity and fear of the pain returning were the two main factors directly related to the whistleblowers' backs and changes in physical activity. Although most informants strongly believed that being physically active helped relieve low back pain, these two factors hindered the increase in physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: When advocating for individuals with acute low back pain to return to or increase physical activity, it is important for clinicians to identify avoidance and/or fear of pain at the earliest stage in order to appropriately tailor advice and reassurance. If activity avoidance and fear of pain are identified, and clinicians wish to encourage patients to begin and maintain increased physical activity, they should explore fear of pain and confidence in avoiding and performing physical activities, among other factors that influence pain. physical activity.",0,0,

1070,Infectious diseases and antibiotic prescription in general practice. observational study in Sicily,"Studies of drug use have shown great variation between different countries in prescribing behavior in general practice. The choice of antibiotic prescription in Italy, for example, seems to indicate a wider use of the parental antibiotic. The aim of this study is to describe the antibiotic prescribing scheme and therapeutic doses used by Sicilian general practitioners (general practitioners) and to evaluate the prescribing attitudes of family physicians towards their use. Each practitioner had to complete a questionnaire for each therapeutic intervention that ended with an antibiotic prescription over a 6-month period. Diagnosis and drugs were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC), respectively. On 9,395 prescriptions administered by 76 physicians from 25 Sicilian towns, analysis showed that acute respiratory symptoms represented the most common indication (31.7%) for medical consultation, with Macrolides [such as azithromycin (8.8%) and clarithromycin (8.3%)]. , Penicillin [eg, amoxicillin (7.1%) and co-amoxiclav (8.4%)], III generation Cephalosporins [such as cefixime (5.5%) and ceftriaxone (5.1%)] represent the most widely used therapeutic groups. it does. The choice of route of administration was influenced by the age of the patients and, more importantly, by the symptoms and signs of the disease rather than the bacteria suspected of causing the disease. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrates the lack of knowledge about antibacterial treatment guidelines among GPs in Sicily, as well as the need for independent educational training to improve antibiotic knowledge and reduce the cost of healthcare.",0,0,
1071,Impact of patients' direct-to-consumer advertised antidepressant demands: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising of prescription drugs in the United States is both widespread and controversial. While critics argue it leads to overprescribing, proponents argue it helps prevent the underuse of effective treatments, especially for conditions that are underrecognized or stigmatized. Purpose To determine the effects of patients' demands on Â¡Â¯ ITC on physiciansÂ¡Â¯ initial treatment decisions in patients with depressive symptoms. Design a Randomized trial using standardized patients (SPs). Six SP roles were created by crossing 2 conditions (major depression or adjustment disorder with depressed mood) with 3 request types (brand-specific, generic, or none). Establishment of Offices of primary care physicians in Sacramento, Calif""; San Francisco, Calif; and Rochester, NY, between May 2003 and May 2004. Participants One hundred and fifty-two family physicians and general internists recruited from single and group practices and health care facilities;"" cooperation rates vary between 53% and 61%. Interventions SPs were randomly assigned to make 298 unannounced visits, with limited assignments due to physicians' seeing 1 SP with major depression and 1 with adjustment disorder. SPs made a brand-specific drug request, a general drug request, or no claim (control condition) in approximately one-third of visits. Key Outcome Measures Data on prescribing, mental health referral, and primary care follow-up from SP written reports, visit audio recordings, chart review, and analysis of written prescriptions and drug samples. The effects of claim type on prescribing were assessed using contingency tables and validated in generalized linear mixed models that account for clustering and adjusted for region, physician, and visit characteristics. Results Standardized patient role fidelity was excellent and physicians' suspicion that they had seen a CP was 13%. In major depression, antidepressant prescribing rates for brand-specific, general, and unwilling CPs were 53%, 76%, and 31%, respectively (P<.001). Antidepressant prescribing rates in adjustment disorder were 55%, 39%, and 10%, respectively (P<.001). The results were validated in multivariate models. Minimally acceptable initial care (any combination of an antidepressant, mental health referral, or follow-up within 2 weeks) made a general request to 98% of CPs in the major depression role, while 90% made a brand-specific request. and 56% of non-claimers (P<.001). Conclusions Patients' wishes have a profound impact on physician prescribing for major depression and adjustment disorder.

This is especially true in the secondary prevention setting, where the benefits of lipid-lowering, anti-platelet and anti-hypertensive drugs have been highlighted in numerous trials. Lifestyle measures address several CHD risk factors simultaneously and are generally free of serious side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether a comprehensive lifestyle change program could positively affect diet and exercise habits in addition to smoking cessation for two years. In addition, it was tried to evaluate whether this program would positively affect the 5-year risk of CHD in the male population included in the study. Design: A total of 197 patients with proven coronary heart disease were included and randomized to a lifestyle intervention program or usual care. Follow-up was after a two-year period. METHODS: The intervention consisted of a low-fat diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, psychosocial support, and education given by nurses for pharmacological and lifestyle measures. Usual care included routine outpatient follow-up. Both groups were given the same range of medication according to the latest guidelines. RESULTS: Patients in the lifestyle intervention group reduced their intake of saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol (P<0.001), increased their exercise levels (P<0.01), and quit smoking (P<0.05), compared to the normal care group. A sub-analysis of the effect of the five-year calculated risk of CHD in men resulted in a relative risk reduction of 22% (9-35 confidence interval 95%). Although significant, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the method's poor statistical power and reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of modern drug therapies for the prevention of secondary cardiovascular disease, it remains possible through a suitable diet, exercise and smoking cessation to demonstrate an additional five-year risk for CHD in men.",0,0,

1074,Influence of prescriber feedback and management guidelines and antibiotic prescribing: a 5-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: The extent of antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) prompted a previous study of an educational intervention based on prescriber feedback and management guidelines. This study demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic prescribing for URTI and a more appropriate antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. Long-term follow-up studies of such training programs are few. OBJECTIVES: This follow-up study aimed to examine whether the reduction in antibiotic prescribing observed in the intervention group of the original study persisted after 5 years and how the prescribing behavior of GPs involved in follow-up differed from a large national scale. GP prescribing questionnaire. METHODS: An attempt was made to contact 157 general practitioners included in the original study. Of these, 121 were both built-in and currently working in public practice. Ninety-six individuals agreed to participate, and 79 of them completed a morbidity and treatment questionnaire that encountered 100 patients (response rate 65.3%). RESULTS: The intervention group (n = 37) continued their pattern of antibiotic prescribing for URTI and antibiotic selection for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis, with no significant change between completion of the original study and 5-year follow-up. The control group (n = 42) showed a downward trend in antibiotic prescribing for URTI, with no significant difference between groups at 5-year follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, both groups prescribed significantly fewer antibiotics for URTI and showed greater adherence to prescribing guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis than participants in a large national GP survey (n = 984). CONCLUSION: This study showed that prescribing behavior was maintained in the intervention group in the long term. However, the prescribing changes observed in the control group and the power limitations of the study make it unclear whether this is the result of a sustained effect of the educational intervention. The differences in both groups from the large national GP survey suggest that other influences on prescribing (such as participation in vocational training for general practice) also have a significant impact.",0,0,
1075,Influencing antibiotic prescribing in general practice: a trial of prescriber feedback and management guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: The extent of use of antibiotics to treat upper respiratory tract infections in general practice is an area of concern due to the growing problem of bacterial resistance. Effective educational strategies are needed to promote rational prescribing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the effectiveness of prescribing feedback and management guidelines in reducing GP-prescribed antibiotics for undifferentiated upper respiratory tract infection and improving antibiotic selection for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. The research tested a phased approach to targeting educational input to high prescribers. METHOD: General Practice trainees (n = 157) in New South Wales to a treatment group (n = 78) receiving an educational intervention on antibiotic use or an unrelated subject. Trainees completed three practice effectiveness questionnaires, each consisting of 110 consecutive patient interviews, with 6-month intervals between questionnaires. Prescriber feedback and management guidelines regarding antibiotic use for URTI and antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis were provided in written form between questionnaires 1 and 2. An educational outreach visit was given to high prescribers between surveys 2 and 3. Antibiotic prescribing rate for all indications for URTI and prescribing rate of selected antibiotics for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescription by the intervention group decreased from 25.0 to 23.3 to 19.7 per 100 URTI problems on three occasions, while the control group increased from 22.0 to 25.0 to 31.7 per 100 URTI problems (P = 0.002). Consistent with accepted guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis, prescribing increased over time from 55.6 to 69.8 to 73.0 per 100 problems in the intervention group but decreased from 59.6 to 57.5 to 58.5 per 100 problems in the control group (P = 0.05) . CONCLUSION: Prescribing feedback and management guidelines have been shown to affect antibiotic prescribing for URTI and antibiotic selection for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. This study provides a model for targeting educational input to prescribers who most need to change their behavior.",0,0,
1076,Information technology for patient safety,"Background Research on patient care has identified significant differences in the quality and safety of healthcare and significant risks of iatrogenic harm as major issues. These failures contribute to high rates of potentially preventable morbidity and mortality and the rising levels of health expenditure seen in many health systems. There have been significant advances in information technology in recent years, and there is now real potential to apply these technological advances to improve healthcare delivery universally. Of particular international interest is the use of eHealth applications. However, there is a large gap between the theoretical and experimentally proven benefits of eHealth applications. While these applications typically have the technical capability to assist professionals in healthcare delivery, insufficient attention to the socio-technical aspects of their use may result in new avoidable risks for patients. Conclusions and discussion Given the current lack of evidence on quality and safety improvements and the cost-benefits associated with introducing eHealth applications, the focus should be on implementing more mature technologies”; it is also important that eHealth applications are evaluated through a comprehensive and rigorous set of measures, ideally at all stages of the application lifecycle.",0,1,

To enable us to better understand the problems faced by physicians in developing countries when obtaining informed consent (IC), we examined their views on the importance of IC in clinical trials, the quantity and quality of information provided to the participant, and the circumstances in this regard. which IC is obtained. Investigators felt that IC was helpful to patients and provided information that helped the patient make decisions about participation. However, for some aspects of the research, such as drug development in general, placebo use, and the randomization process, they felt that most patients did not fully understand the information provided, citing the complexity of the information. ignorance as the main cause. Most researchers were unaware of some of the guidelines created in the Mexican General Health Law,(1) 36% admitted not completing their IC letter. Most investigators gave patients only minutes to make a decision, and 20% of ICs were obtained while the patient was in hospital.

1078,Informed consent in human experiments before the Nuremberg code,"The ethical issue of medical experimentation in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s was very important in the Nuremberg trials and related trials of doctors and public health officials. Those involved in the heinous crimes tried to excuse themselves by arguing that there were no clear rules governing medical research on humans in Germany at the time, and that research practices in Germany were not different from those in the allied countries. In this context, the Nuremberg law of 1947 is generally considered to be the first document to establish ethical regulations in human experimentation on the basis of informed consent. However, new research shows that ethical issues of informed consent were recognized in guidelines for human experimentation as early as the nineteenth century. These guidelines shed light on the still controversial issue of when the concepts of autonomy, informed consent, and therapeutic and non-therapeutic research were first introduced. This issue is gaining relevance in the context of current attempts to assess responsibility and liability for human abuse in the various experiments carried out in the United States, Canada, Russia and other countries since the second world war.",0,0,
1079,Informed consent: coronary artery bypass grafting,"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is a well-documented procedure. Despite the increasing prevalence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), surgical revascularization will continue to play an important role in patients with coronary artery disease. As demonstrated in previous clinical studies, physicians can provide patients with important information about risk-adjusted outcomes. A number of databases have been used to develop risk models to predict morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing CABG. Patients should choose between CABG and PCI according to the physicians' explanations. Major trials have demonstrated a significant survival benefit from CABG among patients at high risk of death from the disease itself, defined by severity of angina, number of diseased vessels, and left ventricular function. However, it is not clear that patients always receive accurate information about whether CABG or PCI is the more appropriate procedure. Initial informed consent should be obtained by an independent consultant using relevant guidelines.",0,0,
1080,Informed shared decision making supported by decision coaches for women with ductal carcinoma in situ: study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Women with breast cancer want to be involved in treatment decision-making. The Directives affirmed the right to informed joint decision-making. However, previous research has shown that the practice of informed co-decision making is sub-optimal, due to physicians' limited resources, power imbalances between patients and physicians, and a lack of evidence-based patient information. We developed an informed co-decision-making program for women with primary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The program provides decision coaching to women by specialist nurses and aims to support participation in decision making and informed choices. In this trial, an informed co-decision program will be evaluated in breast care centers. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare an informed shared decision-making program with standard care. The program includes an evidence-based patient decision aid and training of physicians (2 hours) and specialist breast care and oncology nurses (4 days) in informed co-decision making. Sixteen certified breast care centers recruiting 192 women with primary DCIS will be included. The primary outcome is the extent to which patients are involved in co-decision making, as assessed by MAPPIN-Odyad (multifocal approach to 'sharing' in shared decision making: observer instrument pair). Secondary endpoints include sub-measures of the MAPPIN-inventory (MAPPIN-Honorse, MAPPIN-Ophysician, MAPPIN-O Patient, MAPPIN-Qnurse, MAPPIN-Q Patient, and MAPPIN-Qphysician), informed choice, decision conflict, and duration of encounters. The provision of decision coaching and evidence-based patient decision aids is expected to increase patients' participation in decision-making through informed choices and reduce decision conflicts and doctor encounter time. In addition, an accompanying process assessment will be conducted. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the application of decision coaches in German breast care centers.

1081,Infrastructure for quality transformation: Measurement and reporting in veterans administration intensive care units,"Background Veterans Health Administration (VA) intensive care units (ICUs) develop an infrastructure for quality improvement using information technology and recruiting leadership. Methods Setting The quality improvement program requires the participation of 183 intensive care units. The infrastructure includes measurement (electronic data extraction, analysis), quarterly web-based reporting, and implementation support of evidence-based applications. Leaders prioritize measures based on quality improvement goals. Electronic inference is manually validated against medical records, selecting hospitals with data items and measurements at the extremes (10th, 90th percentile). Results are displayed in graphical, narrative and tabular reports that are compared by type and complexity of the intensive care unit. Results VA admits 103?689Â±1156 ICU patients per year. In electronic business applications, differences in data location and the normal range of some laboratory tests affect data quality. A data management website captures data items important to ICU performance that are not available electronically. A dashboard manages excess data (quarterly reports range from 106-299 pages). More than 85% of ICU principals and nurse administrators review their reports. Leadership interest is sustained through incorporating ICU goals into executive performance engagements, identifying local improvement opportunities with analytical software, and focused reviews. Conclusion Lessons for non-VA organizations include: (1) the need for continuous data validation, (2) key involvement of leadership at multiple levels, (3) support for electronic data when key elements are not available, (4) a data item, and (5) a dashboard. good but not perfect electronic indicator for moving the app while improving its value.",0,0,
1082,Initiation of quality improvement activities in mental health services,"In the public sector mental health care setting, accountability for quality has often been thought of as the responsibility of the individual clinician. This presents a particular challenge in promoting an organization-wide culture of quality improvement in this environment. The introduction of a systemic view of quality may encounter resistance from clinicians who are reluctant to accept that some clinical autonomy must be encompassed in more standard patterns of intervention and assessment. Services should first address the readiness of clinicians to adopt such a culture, which requires strong leadership from the managerial level. The recently diagnosed area of psychosis was chosen in a public sector mental health service as a starting point for initiating a culture of quality improvement. The end result for the organization was a positive commitment to improvement, but the journey has been long and difficult. This article describes the beginning of this ultimately rewarding journey.",0,0,
1083,Innovative strategy for the implementation of chronic heart failure guidelines among family physicians in different healthcare settings in Berlin,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve drug therapy in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective interventional pilot study was conducted with cross-sectional comparative analysis before and after intervention. Ordinary pharmacotherapy was observed for 8 months at two different outpatient settings in Berlin [11 family physicians from individual GP (IGP) practices and 12 family physicians working in a medical care center (MCC)]. Medical care centers provide a new structure for outpatient care and have recently been introduced in Germany. Subsequent intervention required implementation of heart failure guidelines via a computer-based reminder system followed by renewed cross-sectional observation of prescribing behavior for 1 year. Family physicians recruited patients, assessed CHF severity by NYHA class, and referred patients for echocardiography. The study included 190 patients in the initial phase and 209 in the intervention phase. Longitudinal follow-up was performed in 172 cases. Echocardiography was requested by 94.6% of MCC physicians and 79.9% of IGPs. Insufficient medication was observed in both settings. Guideline-based beta-blocker therapy was prescribed to 46.3% of patients (44.8% of IGPs and 48.5% of MCC-GPs). After the intervention, the prescription was improved by 12.3%. There were significant gaps in prescribing (35%) of aldosterone antagonists for severe heart failure, increasing to 44.2% after intervention. CONCLUSION: The problem of inadequate implementation of evidence-based treatment for CHF was partially overcome by using the reminder system, which provided short guide recommendations to participating physicians during the intervention phase.",0,0,
1084,Physician reminders versus inpatient computer-based outpatient orders to increase flu and pneumococcal vaccination rates: a randomized trial.,"Context Computerized reminder systems increase influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, but computerized continuous order systems have not been previously described or evaluated. Purpose To determine the effects of computerized physician orders on inpatient vaccination rates compared with physician reminders. Design, Environment, and Patients A randomized trial of 3777 general medicine patients discharged from 1 of 6 study wards over a 14-month period (November 1, 1998 - December 31, 1999), comprised of 2 overlapping flu seasons in an urban public teaching hospital. Interventions The hospital's computerized physician order entry system identified inpatients eligible for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. For patients with outpatient orders, the system automatically generated vaccine orders for nurses when the patient was discharged. For patients with reminders, the computer system provided physicians with reminders of vaccine orders during routine order entry sessions. Main Outcome Measure Vaccine application. Results During approximately 6 months of the flu season, 50% of all hospitalized patients were determined to be eligible for the flu vaccine. Twenty-two percent of hospitalized patients during the 14 months of the study were eligible for pneumococcal vaccine. Patients with interruptions received flu shots significantly more often (42%) than patients with reminders (30%) (P < .001). Outpatients received the pneumococcal vaccine (51%) significantly more frequently (51%) than reminders (31%) (P < .001). Results Computerized standing orders were more effective than computerized reminders for increasing both influenza and pneumococcal vaccine administration. Our findings suggest that computerized fixed orders should be used more widely for this purpose.",1,1,

1086,Integrated guidance on the care of familial hypercholesterolemia from the International FH Foundation,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a congenital, predominantly inherited disease that markedly elevates plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and causes early coronary heart disease. Worldwide, there are at least 20 million people with AD, but the majority go undetected and current treatment is often inadequate. To address this major gap in coronary prevention, we present consensus-based guidance on the care of AD from an international perspective. Guidance was created from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. Recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, evaluation and management of FD in adults and children and establish guidelines for clinical purposes. They also refer to best practices for cascading screening and risk reporting for FH and testing families, including the use of genetic testing. Treatment guidance is based on risk stratification, management of non-cholesterol risk factors, and the safe and effective use of LDL-lowering therapies. Recommendations are given for lipoprotein apheresis. The use of emerging therapies for FH is also contemplated. This international guide acknowledges evidence gaps, but aims to make the most of contemporary practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for FH care. Accordingly, it should be used to inform clinical judgment and should be tailored to country-specific and local health needs and resources.",0,0,

DESIGN A two-center, open, evaluator-blind randomized controlled trial. SET Secondary health care in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 327 patients with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a diagnosis of drug, alcohol, or both abuse or dependence, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. INTERVENTION The intervention was integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy plus standard care compared to standard care alone. The first phase of therapy - ""motivating"" - is about engaging the patient, then exploring and resolving ambivalence for change in substance use. The second phase - ""action"" - supports and facilitates change using cognitive behavioral approaches. It was administered up to 26 therapy sessions over a year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was death or hospitalization from any cause within 12 months of treatment completion. Secondary outcomes were frequency and amount of substance use (assessed using the timeline tracking method), readiness to change, perceived negative consequences of use, ratings of psychotic symptoms, number and duration of relapses, and overall assessment of functioning and intentional self-harm at 12 and 12 years of age. 24 months with additional timeline follow-up assessments at 6 and 18 months. Analysis was done with the intent to treat and robust estimates of treatment effect were produced. RESULTS 327 participants were randomly assigned to either intervention (n=164) or treatment as usual (n=163). At 24 months, 326 (99.7%) were evaluated on primary outcome and 246 (75.2%) were evaluated on main secondary outcomes. The treatment group had no beneficial effect on hospitalizations or death at follow-up, with 23.3% (38/163) of the treatment group and 20.2% (33/163) of the deceased or admitted controls (adjusted odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval). ) 0.68 to 1.99""; P=0.579.

CONCLUSIONS For people with psychosis and substance abuse, integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy do not improve outcome in terms of hospitalization, symptom outcomes, or functioning. This approach reduces the amount of substance used for at least one year after completion of treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION Controlled Trials Available: ISRCTN14404480.",0,0,
1088,"Integrating ""Back to Sleep"" suggestions into the neonatal ICU app","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that neonatal intensive care units should support and model sudden infant death syndrome risk reduction recommendations significantly prior to the expected discharge of the infant. Healthcare professionals are critical role models for parents, and the way they position babies in the hospital strongly influences parenting practices at home. The aims of this project were to increase the percentage of infants following safe sleep practices in the NICU before discharge and to determine whether improving adherence to these practices would affect parental behavior at home. METHODS: An algorithm detailing when to start safe sleep practices, the ""Back to Sleep"" crib card, training programs for nurses and parents, a crib inspection tool, and post-discharge telephone reminders were developed as quality improvement intervention strategies. RESULTS: NICU compliance with the supine position ranged from 39% to 83% (P < .001), providing a firm sleeping surface from 5% to 96% (P < .001), and removing soft objects from the bed 45%' increased from ten to 75% (P = .001).

1089,Integrating addiction treatment into primary care using mobile health technology: protocol for a practice research study.,"Background Healthcare reform in the United States is encouraging Federally Qualified Health Centers and other primary care practices to integrate addiction treatment and other behavioral health conditions into their practices. The potential for mobile health technologies to manage addiction and comorbidities such as HIV in these settings is great, but largely untested. This document describes a protocol for evaluating the application of an E-Health integrated communications technology, called Seva, delivered to primary care settings via mobile phones. Seva is an evidence-based addiction treatment and recovery support for patients and real-time caseload monitoring for clinicians. Our Methods/Design Implementation strategy uses three models of institutional change: the Program Planning Model to promote acceptance and sustainability, the NIATx quality improvement model to create a welcoming environment for change, and Rogers' diffusion of innovations research that facilitates adaptations to maximize their adoption potential. We will implement . Our asynchronous multi-base design includes three semesters Â¡Âª pretesting (concludes with four months of practice preparation), active Seva practice and maintenance Â¡Âª with phased implementation at six-month intervals between sites. The first field will serve as a pilot clinic. We will monitor the timing of intervention items and evaluate study results in all aspects of the Access, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Care framework, including impacts on clinicians, patients and practices. Our mixed-methods approach will include quantitative (eg, interrupted time-series analysis with clinical units of analysis) and qualitative (eg, staff interviews about adaptations to the implementation protocol) methods and assessment of implementation costs. Discussion If implementation is successful, the field will have proven technology that helps Federally Qualified Health Centers and affiliates provide addiction treatment and recovery support, and a proven strategy for implementing the technology. Seva also has the potential to improve key aspects of addiction treatment, such as referral and treatment processes. A mobile technology and accompanying application model for addiction treatment could provide a cost-effective way to improve the lives of patients with drug and alcohol problems.",0,0,

In 68 patients, the procedure was performed for untreated disease apparently confined above the diaphragm. Abdominal disease cannot be safely excluded on the basis of non-invasive examination at presentation. Clinical assessment of spleen disease was unreliable unless gross splenomegaly was present. Pedal lymphography was accurate in assessing para-aortic and iliac disease, but was of no value in assessing other intra-abdominal lymph node involvement, including mesenteric lymph node. Preoperatively, trephine bone marrow biopsy findings were normal in all patients, and diseased bone marrow was detected in only one patient with intraoperative Stryker-saw biopsy. Intraoperative liver disease was identified in nine patients, some of whom were asymptomatic with clinically undetectable spleen and nodal disease. Detailed clinical staging failed to detect disease in one-third of patients undergoing laparotomy. These studies suggest that an elaborate staging procedure, including laparotomy and splenectomy, remains necessary if radiotherapy is truly to remain the treatment of choice for disease localized in the lymph nodes.

1094,Intentions and prescribing: can the theory of planned behavior explain physician behavior in the following guideline recommendations?,"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have evaluated the usefulness of Planned Behavior Theory (TPB) in explaining physician behavior. This study uses TPB to explain how physicians apply the prescribing recommendations of guidelines. METHODS: We developed the questionnaire through qualitative interviews and a pilot study. A random sample of 155 general practitioners (GPs) from the UK participated in the study. Prescribing and administration data were collected from routine sources. We analyzed the data using regression methods. RESULTS: TPB explained 48% of the variation in reported intentions to follow guidelines prescribing recommendations. Attitudes and perceived controls were predictors of variation in intentions, not subjective norms. TPB belief variables significantly explained the variation in indicators of effective and efficient prescribing (14% and 12%, respectively). Normative, control, and behavioral beliefs contributed to the models. Only for effective prescribing, TPB items remained important in the presence of demographic variables. We did not find a significant relationship between intent and prescribing. RESULTS: TPB helped GPs understand prescribing behavior and intentions to apply a clinical guideline. Beliefs (eg, normative beliefs) were better predictors of behavior than composite scores for their corresponding higher-order constructs (eg, indirect subjective norm). TPB models should be tested in conjunction with random trials to test the causality assumption that change in beliefs ultimately results in change in behavior.",0,0,

Editorials, guidelines, and policy recommendations are excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND KEY RESULTS: Contact with pharmaceutical representatives was common among residents. The majority of the trainees thought the interactions were appropriate. A minority felt that their own prescribing might be affected by contact or gifts, but were more likely to believe that others' prescriptions might be affected. Resident prescribing was associated with pharmaceutical representative visits and availability of samples. While data on the long-term effects of these interventions are limited, various policy and education interventions appear to influence established attitudes towards interactions with industry. Overall, residents reported insufficient education in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical industry has a significant presence during residency training, has gained general acceptance from trainees, and appears to influence prescribing behavior. Training programs can benefit from policies and curricula that inform residents about the impact of the industry and ways to critically evaluate the information provided to them. Recommendations for local and national approaches are discussed.",0,0,
1096,Interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry: What does the literature say?,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the three types of interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry – company-funded clinical trials, company-sponsored continuing medical education (CME), and information provided for physicians by pharmaceutical detailers – on clinical orientation and quality trials, content of CME courses, and physician prescriptions. typing behavior. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and HEALTH search for articles in English published from 1978 to 1993 supported by material from the author's personal collection. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 227 articles from MEDLINE and HEALTH research and approximately 2000 items from the author's library were initially reviewed. The following selection criteria were used: studies conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States""; studies conducted after 1977; quantitative studies detailing survey methods; studies and evaluation of the direction and quality of company-funded clinical studies about the content of CME courses giving clear criteria used; and reports on outcomes of interactions indicating how outcomes were evaluated. Thirty-six studies met these criteria. DATA SHOOT: Information was extracted on five topics: physicians' attitudes towards pharmaceutical industry interactions, frequency of physicians' participation in interactions, company-funded The orientation and quality of clinical trials administered, the content of company-sponsored CME courses, and changes in physician prescribing are behavior that result from interaction. Although ra attends only occasionally, most see the details and attend company-sponsored CME courses. However, doctors don't have a very high opinion of information from detailers or company-sponsored CME events. Many doctors see pharmaceutical companies as an important source of funding for clinical trials, but they are also concerned about accepting money from that source. Company funding of clinical trials can affect the quality of trials and the type of research physicians undertake. Company-sponsored CME courses may have a commercial bias, even if conducted under guidelines designed to ensure the independence of the event. All three types of interactions affect physicians' prescribing behavior, and if information is obtained from detailers, physicians' prescribing practices become less appropriate as a result of interaction. CONCLUSION: Physicians are affected by their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. In many cases, further research is required to determine whether such interactions lead to more or less favorable prescribing practices. CMA's guidelines on this subject should be evaluated to see if they are effective in controlling physician-industry interactions. Further action may be necessary if guidelines fail to prevent adverse effects on prescribing practices.",0,0,
1097,Interdisciplinary perspectives on the management of the restless infant: key strategies for better outcomes,"The aims of this study were to analyze the perspectives of key sources of information with clinical expertise in the care of infants who have not settled in the first few months of life and their families regarding the changes needed to improve outcomes. The research used a purposeful selection strategy and thematic analysis of key informative interviews with 24 health professionals from 11 disciplines. Informants were selected for extensive experience in managing unsettled infants and their families. Participants confirmed the existing evidence that postnatal care is divided in Australia. All were of the view that, first, early primary care intervention for unsettled infants and their families and, second, improved interprofessional communication is vital if the burden of this problem on the infant, family and health system is to be minimized. Third, there was consensus that there were significant gaps in the knowledge base and management behavior of health professionals. Educational resources, best practice guidelines, shared assessment frameworks for primary care practitioners, and strategies to improve interprofessional communication are needed to improve health outcomes and reduce the burden of this common but complex postpartum problem.",0,0,
1098,Internal and external validity of clustered randomized trials: a systematic review of recent studies.,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate aspects of the internal validity of recently published randomized cluster studies and to investigate reporting information useful in assessing the external validity of these trials. DESIGN Review of 34 clusters of randomized studies published in primary care in 2004 and 2005 in seven journals (British Medical Journal, British Journal of General Practice, Family Practice, Prevention Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of General Internal Medicine, Pediatrics). DATA SOURCES National Library of Medicine (Medline) via PubMed. DATA DRAWING To assess internal validity, we extracted data on the suitability of sample size calculations and analyzes, methods of identifying and recruiting individual participants, and blinding. To investigate reporting of information useful in assessing external validity, we extracted data on cluster relevance, inclusion and retention, cluster generalizability, and feasibility and acceptability of intervention to healthcare providers in clusters. RESULTS 21 (62%) studies included clustering in sample size calculations and in 30 (88%) analyses, nearly a quarter were potentially biased due to procedures surrounding recruitment and identification of patients; individual respondents were blinded to allocation status in 19 (56%), and outcome raters were blind in 15 (44%). Issues affecting their internal validity, such as appropriate sample size calculations and analysis, have been widely disseminated and are now better addressed by researchers. Blinding individuals who identify patients and place them in allocation status is recommended, but not always done. For internal validity in trials where individual participants are not recruited There may be fewer obstacles. External validity does not seem to have been adequately addressed in many studies, but it can be argued that it is just as important as internal validity in assessing quality as a basis for healthcare intervention.",0,0,
1099,International College of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA) recommendations for the creation of multilingual speech tests. ICRA Multilingual Speaking Tests Working Group,"OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for the development of two types of closed set speech perception tests that can be administered and interpreted alike across languages. The guidelines cover the most commonly used digit triplet and matrix sentence tests for testing speech recognition in noise. It was developed by a working group on the Multilingual Speech Tests of the International College of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA). DESIGN: Recommendations are based on the research experience of members of the ICRA Working Group, as well as reviews of current evaluations of numerical triple and matrix tests. They represent the results of a consensus process. RESULTS: The resulting recommendations relate to: Test design and word choice""; Speaker characteristics; Voice recording and stimulus preparation; Noise masking; Test management;"" and Test validation. RESULTS: By following these guidelines for the development of any such new tests, clinicians and researchers working in any language will be able to perform tests whose results can be compared and combined in cross-language studies.",0,0,
1100,Intervention in infancy: implications for autism spectrum disorders,"There is a paucity of empirical research into the characteristics of successful interventions for this population, along with the scarcity of empirically approved treatments for infants and young children under 3 years of age with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Still, early screening efforts have focused on identifying autism risk in children under age 3. To create ASD interventions for infants and young children on the basis of evidence-based characteristics, the present article presents the results of a systematic literature search and effect size analysis of effective interventions for infants and young children with other developmental disorders: those born at an early age, with or with developmental disorders. those at high risk for developmental impairments due to the presence of an associated biological or familial condition. A review of 32 controlled, high-quality experimental studies revealed that the most effective interventions routinely use a combination of four specific intervention procedures, including (1) parent involvement in the intervention, continuous parent coaching that focuses on both parent responsiveness and parent responsiveness. temporal characteristics, including cues and teaching families to provide infant interventions, (2) individualization according to each infant's developmental profile, (3) focusing on a broad range of learning goals rather than a narrow range, and (4) starting as early as risk. is detected and ensures that the intervention is more intense and long-lasting. These four characteristics of effective interventions for infants and young children with other developmental difficulties likely represent a solid foundation on which researchers and clinicians can create effective interventions for infants and young children at risk or affected by ASD.",0,0,
1101,Intervention development for the integration of traditional tobacco cessation interventions into routine CAM practice,"BACKGROUND: Practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are an important and growing presence in healthcare systems worldwide. A key question is whether evidence-based behavior change interventions routinely used in traditional health care can also be integrated into CAM practice to address public health priorities. Essential for successful integration are intervention approaches that are acceptable and consistent with the practice patterns and treatment approaches of different CAM practitioners – that is, they have contextual validity. Intervention development to ensure context validity was an integral part of Project CAM Reach (CAMR), a project that examines the public health potential of tobacco cessation education for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists (CAM practitioners). This article describes the formative research conducted to achieve this goal. METHODS: Intervention development undertaken in the three CAM disciplines (chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy) consisted of six iterative steps: 1) exploratory key informant interviews""; 2) local CAM practitioner community survey; 3) Demonstrating current tobacco cessation curriculum with TAT practitioner physicians 4) adaptation/adaptation of existing curriculum 5) external review of adaptations 6) delivery of CAM specific curriculum to CAM practitioners with follow-up curriculum evaluation RESULTS: CAM practitioners identified barriers and facilitators to addressing tobacco use with patients/clients and saw the relevance and acceptability of intervention content Intervention development process took care of their real-world intervention concerns Comprehensive intervention appropriate to the context of each CAM discipline found unnecessary Participants and consultants from all CAM disciplines embraced the training content, broad relevance and practice across the three CAM dis its rope. All findings informed the final intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The participatory and iterative formative research process provided a context-valid intervention in real-world CAM practices: 1) it is patient/client-centered and emphasizes the practitioner's role in the healing relationship; 2) are sensitive to the different contexts of CAM practitioners' work and patient/client relationships; 3) integrates relevant best practices from the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of tobacco addiction"" and 4) conforms to the diverse healing philosophies, scope of practice, and practice patterns found in participating CAM practitioners.

1102,Intervention for autistic spectrum disorders,"comprehensive approach to the assessment of any child with autism must be tailored to each child and family. This premise applies to psychopharmacological interventions as well as medical treatments and special education services. Behavioral therapy, as opposed to pharmacological, is the hallmark of effective intervention for autism. Physicians caring for children with autism need to be familiar with the education law and intervention recommendations. Goals should include improved functional verbal and nonverbal communication and social skills, increased participation in developmentally appropriate activities, development of enhanced fine and gross motor skills and independent academic and organizational skills, as well as replacing problem behaviors with developmentally appropriate behaviors. Treating children with autism is difficult, but often necessary for chronic behavioral difficulties. In the absence of clear and available guidelines, we sought to use the evidence and clinical experience to propose an algorithm based on symptom clusters. Although children with autism are more sensitive to drugs at lower doses and more susceptible to side effects than other children, medical intervention can provide a significant improvement in quality of life for the child and family. Careful thought leading to accurate identification of target behaviors can appropriately guide better alternatives to the drug. Although these approaches are costly and time-consuming efforts, making such efforts is the only available way to improve potential outcomes for individuals with autism, as well as reduce lifetime societal costs for each individual.",0,0,
1103,Intervention mapping for the development of a strategy to implement insurance medicine guidelines for depression,"BACKGROUND: This article describes the development of a strategy for implementing insurance medicine guidelines for depression. The use of guidelines aims to lead to a more transparent and uniform assessment of claimants with depressive symptoms. METHODS: The implementation strategy was developed using the Intervention Mapping (IM) method for alignment with insurance-medical practice. The ASE behavioral explanation model (Attitude, Social Impact and Self-efficacy) was used as the theoretical basis for the development study. A literature study on implementation strategies and interviews with insurance physicians were conducted to develop tools to be used with the guideline. These instruments are designed to suit the needs and working conditions of insurance physicians. Performance indicators were defined with input from insurance physicians to measure the quality of assessment and adherence to guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This study resulted in the development of a training course to teach insurance physicians how to apply depression guidelines using the tools mentioned above. The effectiveness of this training course will be evaluated in the Randomized Controlled Trial. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IM has made it possible to develop guidance support tools adapted to insurance medical practice.",0,0,
1104,Interventions by Health Professionals Providing Routine Child Health Care to Reduce Child Tobacco Smoke Exposure: A Review and Meta-analysis,"IMPORTANCE: Reducing children's exposure to tobacco smoke is a public health priority. The guidelines recommend that health professionals in child health settings address the issue of exposure to tobacco smoke (TSE) in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of interventions by health professionals providing routine child health care in reducing TSI in children. DATA SOURCES: A secondary analysis of the 57 studies included in the 2014 Cochrane review followed by an extended search. Controlled trials (published up to June 2015) of interventions focused on reducing child TSE were identified, without any restrictions on who did the interventions. Secondary data extraction was carried out in August 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible for inclusion in this review and meta-analyses that address the consequences of concern (child TSE reduction and parental smoking behaviors) regarding routine child health care provided by healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, medical assistants, health educators, and dietitians). . DATA ATTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study details and quality characteristics were derived independently by 2 authors. If outcome measures were similar enough, meta-analysis was performed using DerSimonian and Laird's random effects model. Otherwise, the results are explained narratively. MAIN RESULTS AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was reduction in child TSE. The secondary outcomes of interest were parental smoking cessation, parental smoking cessation, and mother's postpartum relapse prevention. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met selection criteria. A narrative analysis of 6 studies measuring child TSE showed no intervention effects relative to the comparison groups. Similarly, a meta-analysis of 9 studies measuring parental smoking cessation showed no overall intervention effect (n = 6399) (hazard ratio 1.05""; 95% CI, 0.74-1.50; P = .78). Data measuring post-smoking relapse prevention showed a significant overall intervention effect (n = 1293) (hazard ratio 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14; ""P = .01). The high level of study heterogeneity likely resulted from variability in outcome measures, follow-up time, intervention strategies, and unknown intervention accuracy. RESULTS AND RELATIONSHIP: Interventions by healthcare professionals providing routine child health care can be effective in preventing relapse in maternal smoking. More research is needed to improve the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing child TSE and increasing parental smoking cessation. The findings of this meta-analysis have policy and practice implications for routine pediatric healthcare professional interventions aimed at reducing children's exposure to tobacco smoke.",0,0,
1105,Interventions for adolescent depression in primary care,"Background: Depression in adolescents is underrecognized and undertreated despite its poor long-term consequences, including increased risk of suicide. Primary care settings may be critical places for defining depression, but little is known about the usefulness of primary care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the evidence for the treatment of depression in primary care settings, focusing on the evidence for psychosocial, educational, and/or supportive intervention strategies. METHODS: Available data on brief psychosocial treatments for adolescent depression in primary settings were reviewed. Given the paucity of direct studies, we also drew on the relevant literature to summarize the available evidence on whether short-term, psychosocial support from a member of the primary care team can improve depression outcomes with or without medication. RESULTS: We identified 37 studies on the treatment of adolescent depression in primary care. Only 4 studies have directly examined the impact of primary care-provided psychosocial interventions on adolescent depression, but they suggest that such interventions may be effective. Indirect evidence from other psychosocial/behavioral interventions, including anticipatory guidance and efforts to improve adherence, and adult depression studies also demonstrate the benefits of primary care-provided interventions alongside the impact of provider training to improve psychosocial skills. CONCLUSIONS: Given the evidence that short-term psychosocial support with or without medication improves a range of outcomes, including adolescent depression itself, there is potential for successful treatment of adolescent depression in primary care. Given the major public health challenge posed by adolescent depression, the likelihood that many depressed adolescents are unable to receive specialized services, and new guidelines for managing adolescent depression in primary care, clinicians may usefully consider initiating supportive interventions in primary care settings.",0,0,
1106,Interventions for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical and surgical patients at risk for venous thromboembolism,"OBJECTIVE: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that the use of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients at risk for VTE is safe, effective, and cost-effective. Despite this, prophylactic treatments for VTE are underused. System-wide interventions to improve the use of VTE prophylaxis may be more effective than relying on the prescribing behavior of individual providers. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of interventions designed to increase the administration of thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in order to: 1. Increase in the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis and appropriate prophylaxis 2. Reduction in the risk of symptomatic VTE3. Decreased risk of asymptomatic VTE4. The security of the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Research Coordinator (TSC), we searched the Group's Private Registry (last searched July 2010) and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) 2010, Issue 3. PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases (April 19, 2010) and reference lists of related review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all studies with interventions aimed at increasing the use of prophylaxis and/or appropriate prophylaxis in hospitalized adult patients, reducing the rate of symptomatic VTE or asymptomatic VTE. We excluded studies that simply distributed published guidelines and studies whose interventions were not clearly identified. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected the following results: proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis (RP), proportion of patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis (RAP) (primary outcomes), and outcomes such as symptomatic VTE occurrence, asymptomatic VTE, and safety bleeding. We classified the interventions as education, warnings, and multifaceted interventions. With random effects meta-analysis, we meta-analyzed RCTs and nonrandomized studies (NRS) separately and evaluated heterogeneity using I(2)statistics and subgroup analysis. Prior to analysis, we decided that if three or more studies were available for a particular intervention, the results would be aggregated. We evaluated publication bias using funnel plots and cumulative meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 55 studies. One of these data was reported as patient-days and could not be quantitatively analyzed with the others. The 54 studies (8 RCTs and 46 NRS) that remained eligible for inclusion in our quantitative synthesis enrolled a total of 78,343 participants. Among the RCTs, there was sufficient data to pool the results for a primary outcome (prophylaxis received) for the 'warning' intervention. Alerts, such as computerized reminders or stickers in patient charts, were associated with a 13% risk difference (RD) (95% confidence interval (CI) 1% to 25%), indicating an increase in the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis. ). Among the NRS, there was sufficient data to combine both primary outcomes for each type of intervention. The pooled risk differences for prophylaxis received ranged from 8% to 17%, and for appropriate prophylaxis received, from 11% to 19%. Education and warnings were associated with statistically significant increases in prescribing appropriate prophylaxis, and multiple interventions were associated with statistically significant increases in prescribing any prophylaxis and appropriate prophylaxis. Multiple interventions had the greatest combined effects. The I(2) results showed significant statistical heterogeneity, explained in part by patient types and hospital type. A subgroup analysis showed that multifaceted interventions with a warning may be more effective at improving rates of prophylaxis and appropriate prophylaxis than those without a warning. Results for VTE and safety outcomes did not show significant benefits or harms, but most studies were insufficient to evaluate these outcomes. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed a large number of studies applying various system-wide strategies aimed at improving thromboprophylaxis rates in many settings and patient populations. We found statistically significant improvements in prophylaxis prescription associated with alerts (RCTs) and multiple interventions (RCTs and NRS), and improvements in appropriate prophylaxis prescription in NRS with the use of education, alerts, and multiple interventions. Multifaceted interventions with a warning component may be most effective. The sources of heterogeneity shown included patient types and hospital type. The results of our review will help physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administrators and policy makers make practical decisions on the local adoption of specific system-wide measures to improve the prevention of VTE, a major public health problem. We found no significant benefit for VTE results"";"" however, previous RCTs evaluating the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis and powering these results have demonstrated the benefit of prophylactic treatments and a favorable balance of benefit against the increased risk of bleeding events.",0,1,
1107,Interventions to increase patients' trust in doctors and physician groups,"BACKGROUND: Trust is an essential component of the patient-doctor relationship and is associated with increased satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care. It is unclear whether there are interventions that are known to be effective in increasing patient confidence in doctors. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at increasing the patient's confidence in the doctor or a group of doctors. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2003), MEDLINE(1966 - week 4 2003), EMBASE (1985 - July 2003), Health Star (1975 - July 2004), PsycINFO (1967) . July 2004), CINAHL (1982 - June 2003), LILACS (1982 - April 2003), African Trials Register (1948 - April 2003), African Health Anthology (1924 - April 2003), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 - April 2003), and bibliographies of studies considered for inclusion. We also searched for bibliographies of studies considered for inclusion and contacted researchers active in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, pre- and post-controlled trials, and interrupted time series studies of interventions (informative, educational, behavioral, organizational) for physicians or patients (or caregivers), where trust is assessed primary or secondary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the study and extracted data. KEY RESULTS: Three RCTs, all published in English and set in North American primary care, and involving 1916 participants were included. There was considerable heterogeneity in the aims, format and content of the interventions. A trial of an educational intervention to improve family physicians' communication behaviors (20 physicians evaluated by 414 patients) showed no effect on trust. The other two interventions were patient-focused. One investigated the effect on trust of explaining physician incentives to patients (n= 918) in a Health Care Organization (HMO) and did not show a decrease in trust. Another investigated the effect of induction visits on the confidence of new HMO members (n=564) in HMO doctors. Confidence in physicians increased after visit for some type of induction visit compared to control, group visit (confidence out of 10 (standard deviation (SD)) 8.8 (1.5) and 7.1 (2.2), difference 1.7, ( 95% confidence) range from 1.22 to 2.18)). However, there were many dropouts and the analysis was not intended to cure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention can increase or decrease confidence in physicians. More trials are needed to explore the impact of policy changes, guidelines, and training of specific physicians on patients' trust.",0,0,
1108,Interventions for migraine prophylaxis: an umbrella systematic review protocol and network meta-analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple interventions are effective in migraine prophylaxis. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to summarize the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attack. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct an umbrella systematic review to identify appropriate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for interventions recommended for migraine prophylaxis according to guidelines. A comprehensive literature review will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews to be screened for RCTs. We will describe the general information of RCTs for participants, interventions, outcome measures, comparisons, and primary findings. In addition, a network meta-analysis will be performed to determine the comparative effectiveness of treatments with a random effects model. Absolute and relative effectiveness of treatments will be ensured. Heterogeneity and inconsistency between trials will be assessed with the I(2) statistical test and Cochrane's Q test. The risk of bias will be assessed and the overall strength of the evidence will be summarized. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence of treatments for migraine prophylaxis and may provide a ranking of treatments to help patients and clinicians choose the best option.

1110,Interventions to modify obstetrician behavior to promote weight-related support for obese pregnant women: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a rapid increase in the publication of guidelines for managing obesity and weight gain in pregnancy over the past five years. Health professionals have identified many barriers to this practice area, including the need to improve communication skills, beliefs that pregnant women will have negative reactions to weight-related discussions, and a lack of weight management knowledge. This systematic review aimed to determine: the effectiveness of interventions in changing the practice of health professionals regarding maternal obesity or weight management during pregnancy”; and what behavior modification techniques and forms of intervention have been used in interventions to date. RESULTS: The search strategy included electronic databases, trial registries, and citation search. Inclusion criteria were intervention studies aimed at changing healthcare professionals' practices regarding maternal obesity or weight management. Searches identified 3,608 trials. However, no eligible completed studies were identified. A registered Canadian randomized controlled trial was identified. Trial to support compliance with gestational weight gain guidelines It includes an educational intervention for family physicians with the aim of the current focus is on changing the behavior of pregnant women. These interventions do not address multiple health professionals' barriers to maternal obesity and weight management practice.

1111,Interventions to improve follow-up for abnormal findings in cancer screening,"The potential reduction in morbidity and mortality through cancer screening cannot be achieved without appropriate follow-up care for abnormalities detected through screening. In this article, the authors critically review the existing literature on correlations in receiving appropriate follow-up care for abnormalities detected on screening, as well as on interventions designed to increase rates of receiving follow-up care. Lessons learned identify what is known and what is unknown about factors that predict or relate to the receipt of follow-up care. Similarly, effective interventions to increase follow-up are identified and gaps identified. A conceptual model has been developed that categorizes the healthcare system in the United States into four levels: policy, practice, provider, and patient. Some patient-level factors influencing follow-up recruitment are identified, but lack of data severely limits understanding of provider, practice, and policy level correlations. Most intervention studies to increase follow-up uptake have focused on patient-level factors and have targeted the follow-up of abnormal Papanicolaou smears. There is insufficient information on the effectiveness of interventions at the provider, practice or policy level. Standard definitions of what constitutes appropriate follow-up are lacking, severely limiting the comparability of findings between studies. The validity of the various methods for obtaining outcome data has not been clearly established. More research is needed on interventions that target provider, system, and policy-level factors, particularly those focused on the follow-up of colorectal and breast abnormalities. Standardization of definitions and measures is necessary to facilitate comparisons between studies. Cancer 2004. Published by the American Cancer Society in 2004.",0,1,
1112,Interventions to increase hospital patient satisfaction with healthcare providers and systems: a systematic review,"Background Many hospital systems seek to increase patient satisfaction, as assessed by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) surveys. A systematic review of the available experimental evidence could inform these efforts and is not yet available. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature by scanning electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE, six databases of the Cochrane Library, and gray literature databases. We included studies involving hospital patients with interventions targeting at least one of the 11 HCAHPS domains and meeting our quality filter score on the 27-item Downs and Black coding scale. We calculated the post hoc power when appropriate. Results A total of 59 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 44 did not meet the 50% quality filter (mean quality rating 27.8Â±10.9%). Of the 15 studies (mean quality rating 67.3Â±10.7%) that met the quality filter, 8 included the Communication with Doctors HCAHPS domain, 6 General Hospital Rating, 5 Communication with Nurses, 5 Pain Management, 5 Goal It aimed at communication. About Medications, 5 target Recommend Hospital, 3 target Hospital Environment Quiet, 3 target Hospital Environment Cleanliness, and 3 target Discharge Information. Significant HCAHPS improvements were reported with the eight interventions, but their generalizability may be limited by narrowly focused patient populations, heterogeneity of the approach, and other methodological concerns. Conclusions Although there are several studies showing some improvement in the HCAHPS score through various interventions, we conclude that more rigorous research is needed to identify effective and generalizable interventions to increase patient satisfaction.",0,0,
1113,Interventions to increase the use of electronic health information by health practitioners to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes,"BACKGROUND: A wealth of health information is available and, if applied in clinical practice, can contribute to effective patient care. Despite the abundance of information, suboptimal care is common. Many factors influence practitioners' use of health information, and the format (electronic or other) may be one such factor. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of interventions aimed at improving or increasing health practitioners' use of electronic health information (EHI) on professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library (Wiley), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and LISA (EBSCO) up to November 2013. We contacted researchers in this field and searched the reference lists of relevant articles. . SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that evaluated the effects of interventions to improve or increase EHI use by healthcare practitioners on professional practice and patient outcomes. We defined EHI as information accessed from a computer. We defined 'use' as logging into the EHI. We considered any health practitioner interested in patient care. Including randomized, non-randomized and cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs, NRCTs, CRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) we did. : electronic and printed health information""; EHI on different electronic devices (e.g. desktop, laptop or tablet computers, etc.; mobile / mobile phones); EHI through different user interfaces; EHI with or without an education or training component;"" and EHI compared to any other type or source of information. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the included studies. Following our decision to define admissions to the EHI as a measure of professional behavior, we reassessed previously excluded studies. We reported the results in natural units. Whenever possible, we calculated and reported the median effect size (odds ratio (OR), interquartile range (IQR)). Meta-analysis was not possible due to the high heterogeneity between studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs and four CRCTs involving 352 physicians, 48 residents, and 135 allied health practitioners. The overall risk of bias and the quality of evidence were low. One comparison was supported by three studies and three comparisons were supported by one study, but results were highly heterogeneous between the three studies. We did not find any studies supporting EHI, although there is no alternative. Given these factors, it was not possible to determine the relative effectiveness of interventions. All studies reported practitioners' use of EHI, two reported on compliance with electronic practice guidelines, and none reported on patient outcomes. One trial (139 participants) measured adherence to guideline for the electronic guide versus the printed guide, but reported no difference between groups (median OR 0.85, IQR 0.74 to 1.08). One small crossover trial (10 participants) reported increased use of clinical guidelines when mobile and fixed desktop computers were provided (mean use per shift: intervention group (IG) 3.6, standard deviation (SD) 1.7, and control group (CG) 2.0 (SD 1.9) , P-value = 0.033). One crossover trial (203 participants) reported that using a customized interface versus a generic interface had little effect on practitioners' use of EHI (mean difference in adjusted end-of-study rate: 0.77 logins/month/users, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.43 to 1.11). Three studies included education or training and reported increased use of EHI by practitioners after training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While this review suggests that EHI use increases when practitioners are provided with EHI and education or training, it provided no evidence that EHI use translates into improved clinical practice or patient outcomes. We have defined use as the activity of logging into an EHI resource, but based on our findings, use does not automatically translate into EHI practice in practice. While the use of EHI is an important component of evidence-based medicine, it alone is insufficient to improve patient care or clinical practice. For EHI to be applied in patient care, it will be necessary to understand why practitioners are reluctant to apply EHI when treating people, and to identify the most effective way(s) to reduce this reluctance.",0,1,
1114,Interventions to change healthcare provider adherence to asthma guidelines: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Health care provider compliance with asthma guidelines is poor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve healthcare providers' adherence to asthma guidelines on the healthcare process and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Data sources included Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, and, through July 2012, the Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education. Independently matched investigators evaluated study relevance. Investigators abstracted the data sequentially and independently graded the evidence. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible studies were classified according to intervention: decision support, organizational change, feedback and supervision, clinical pharmacy support, education only, payment for quality improvement/performance, multicomponent and information only. Half were randomized trials (n = 35). There was moderate evidence of increased supervisory drug prescriptions and clinical pharmacy support for decision support, feedback, and supervision, and low-grade evidence for institutional change and multi-component interventions. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision support and clinical pharmacy interventions to increase provision of patient self-education/asthma action plans. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision support tools to reduce ED visits, and low-grade evidence suggests no benefit for this outcome with organizational change, training only, and payment for quality improvement/performance. CONCLUSIONS: Decision support tools, feedback and supervision, and clinical pharmacy support were most likely to improve providers' adherence to asthma guidelines, as measured by health care process outcomes. There is a need to evaluate healthcare provider-targeted interventions with standardized outcomes.",0,1,
1115,Interventions to promote evidence-based care for children with ADHD in primary care,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder among children. Community-based doctors are often the primary care providers for children with ADHD. A set of consensus guidelines has been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics that provides best practice diagnostic procedures for primary care physicians. These recommendations highlight the importance of using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria as the basis for diagnosing ADHD and conducting systematic follow-up, including the collection of parent and teacher rating scales to quantitatively assess response to treatment. Despite the widespread dissemination of these recommendations and active support for their adoption, overall compliance with the guideline is known to be poor. Two types of intervention models, ancillary service and office system modification, have been proposed to encourage the adoption of evidence-based ADHD practice in primary care settings. This article reviews the effectiveness of these intervention models and discusses the cost and sustainability of each model in relation to the feasibility of expanding the intervention.",0,1,
1116,Internal conflicts of interest in clinical research: need for disclosure,"Protecting human subjects from researchers' conflicts of interest is critical to the integrity of clinical research. Personal financial conflicts of interest are addressed by university policies, professional society guidelines, public standards, and government regulations, but ""internal conflicts of interest"" - conflicts of interest found in all clinical research - have received relatively little attention. Such conflicts arise in all clinical research efforts as a result of the tension between professionals' responsibilities to their research and their patients, and both academic and financial incentives. These conflicts should be disclosed to research subjects and managed with as much care as financial conflicts of interest.",0,0,
1117,Introduction: Understanding and influencing multilevel factors throughout the cancer care process,"While healthcare services in the United States fail to provide the care recommended in published guidelines, it is notoriously expensive. Therefore, there is a need to consider our approach to healthcare delivery. Cancer care is a good example to consider because it covers the continuum of health care issues from primary prevention to long-term survival and end-of-life care. In this monograph, we emphasize that healthcare delivery takes place in a multi-level system that includes organisations, teams and individuals. To achieve healthcare delivery that aligns with the Institute of Medicine's six quality objectives (safety, effectiveness, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centredness, and equity), we need to influence multiple levels of this multi-level system. The idea that multiple levels of contextual influence influence behavior through interdependent interactions is a well-established ecological view. This view has been used to analyze health care delivery and health inequalities. However, the experience of considering multilevel interventions in healthcare is much less robust. This monograph contains 13 chapters on expanding the research base for multilevel interventions in healthcare delivery. Topics include clinical multilevel thinking cases in health care delivery, knowledge of multilevel interventions, study design and measurement considerations, methods of combining interventions, time taken into account in assessing impacts, measuring impacts, simulations, practice multilevel thinking about health systems and inequalities, and Enforcement of the Affordable Care Act 2010. Our aim is to establish an agenda to continue multilevel intervention research not because it warrants improvement in our current approach to healthcare, but because it warrants improvement in our current approach to healthcare. The complexity of the multilevel environment in which care takes place did not provide the desired improvements in the quality of care outlined by the Institute of Medicine at the turn of the millennium.",0,0,
1118,Exploring breast symptoms in primary care: increasing compliance with best available recommendations,"The aim of this study was to determine whether a targeted intervention could improve primary care practitioners' compliance with guidelines for the management of women with breast symptoms. One hundred and twelve practitioners from randomly selected sites across Australia prospectively supervised their research for each woman with a new breast symptom over two 12-week periods before and five months after the national guidelines were published. Between the two audits, physicians received feedback on their colleagues' practices and attended a seminar led by experts from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in their local area. For the five recommendations, there were statistically significant improvements at the second visit, in accordance with standard Investigation of New Breast Symptom (INBS) guidelines. All this was for the investigation of breast masses. At the first audit, there were seven recommendations where practitioners already managed more than 80% of women according to the INBS, and at the second audit there were no statistically significant increases in compliance. The other six recommendations were in lower agreement with the recommendations prior to the release of the guidelines and did not improve significantly at the second audit. These tended to be for conditions that were less common and clinical findings were not consistent with other test results. We conclude that a targeted intervention improves physician compliance with best available advice for investigating women presenting in primary care with new breast symptoms. More education programs are needed to improve research on rarer symptoms and increase physicians' confidence in the results of their clinical examinations.",0,0,
1119,Is it possible to predict improved diabetes outcomes following diabetes self-management education: mixed methods longitudinal design.,"OBJECTIVE: To predict diabetes outcomes of people participating in the Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) program from baseline data. DESIGN: A mixed method longitudinal experimental study. 6 practice nurses and 2 clinical academics undertook blinded assessments of all baseline and process data to predict clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes at 6 months after the DSME program. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: -31 people with type 2 diabetes who have not had DSME before. INTERVENTION: All participants undertook the Diabetes Manual 1:1 self-directed learning 12-week DSME program supported by practice nurses trained as Diabetes Manual facilitators. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Glucose hemoglobin (HbA1c), diabetes knowledge, physical activity, waist circumference, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, anxiety, depression, demographics, change talk, and treatment satisfaction. These variables were chosen because they are known to influence self-management behavior or be influenced by a DSME program based on empirical evidence. RESULTS: Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were available for 27 participants, 13 (48%) male, 22 (82%) white British, mean age 59 years, and mean type 2 diabetes duration 9.1 years. Significant reductions were found in HbA1c t(26)=2.35, p=0.03 and diabetes distress t(26)=2.30, p=0.03 and significant increase in knowledge t(26)=-2.06, p=0.05 from baseline, and 6 months. No significant changes were found in waist circumference, physical activity, anxiety, depression, or self-efficacy. The accuracy of the estimates varied slightly between clinical academics and practice nurses, but greatly between outcome (0-100%). The median and mode accuracy of the predicted outcome was 66.67%. The accuracy of the prediction for the key outcome of HbA1c was 44.44%. Diabetes distress had the highest prediction accuracy (81.48%). RESULTS: Clinicians in this small study were unable to identify individuals most likely to achieve improvement in outcomes from DSME. DSME should be introduced to all patients with diabetes, according to guidelines.",0,0,
1120,"Is provider type associated with cancer screening and prevention: advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants and physicians","BACKGROUND: Physician's recommendations for cancer screening and prevention are related to patient compliance. However, time constraints, especially with increasing demand from the Affordable Care Act in the United States, can limit doctors' ability to provide all recommended preventive services. Team-based practice involving advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants (APRN/PA) can help meet this demand. This study explores the relationship between an APRN/PA visit and receiving cancer screening and prevention recommendations consistent with guidelines. METHODS: Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression (n = 26,716) to assess the type of provider seen and the adoption of cancer screening and prevention recommendations consistent with guidelines. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, women who had a primary care physician (PCP) and APRN/PA or a PCP without APRN/PA in the past 12 months were more likely to comply with cervical and breast cancer screening guidelines, did not see PCP or APRN/PA (for provider type). all p < 0.0001). Men and women who saw a PCP and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA were more likely than men and women who did not see to receive colorectal cancer screening and advice to quit smoking and engage in physical activity consistent with the guidelines. PCP or APRN/PA (all p < 0.01 for provider type). CONCLUSIONS: Seeing a PCP alone or in combination with an APRN/PA is associated with patient receiving cancer prevention and screening recommendations consistent with guidelines. Integrating APRN/PA into primary care can help provide cancer prevention and screening services. Further intervention research efforts are needed to explore how APRN/PA can best increase cancer screening, HPV vaccination and uptake of behavioral counseling, particularly during this time of health reform.",0,0,
1121,Is there a gap between recommended and 'real world' practices in teen depression management? Medical file control of the application,"BACKGROUND: The literature has shown that distributing guidelines alone is insufficient to ensure that guideline recommendations are incorporated into daily clinical practice. METHODS: We aimed to explore the gaps between guideline recommendations and clinical practice in the management of youth with depression by undertaking oversight of medical files in a service area public mental health service for 15 to 25 year olds in Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: The results showed that the assessment and recording of depression severity was not systematic and consistent to enable appropriate treatment planning"";"" that the majority of youth (74.5%) were prescribed an antidepressant prior to an adequate trial of psychotherapy, and less than 50% were followed for improvement of depression symptoms and suicidal behaviors (35% and 30%, respectively) induced by antidepressant treatment. 92% of first-line prescriptions for antidepressant naïves aged 18 years and younger were for fluoxetine, which was encouragingly recommended. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlighted the need for targeted strategies to ensure effective implementation. These strategies may include delivery system tools that allow for systematic monitoring of symptoms of depression and adverse side effects, particularly suicidal behavior. In addition, youth-specific psychotherapy, which includes the most effective ingredients for this age group and is presented in a youth-friendly way, will assist in the effective implementation of the guidelines recommendations for participation in an adequate trial of psychotherapy prior to initiation of medication.",0,0,
1122,Is non-targeted outreach visit effective in primary care? A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in clinical care. However, they do not apply on their own. Outreach visits can improve prescribing behavior. METHODS: Routine methods were used to distribute guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori eradication in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial before and after including all common practices in a health region. Intervention practices were offered a visit and an audit by a pharmacist trained in outreach visiting techniques. Intervention was assessed using level three Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data for metronidazole and omeprazole for two 12-month periods associated with the introduction of guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 38 intervention practices, 19 accepted the outreach visit and three accepted the supervision offer. There was a significant increase in omeprazole use during the dose-unit study of 0.24 [95 percent confidence interval (CI) +0.19 to +0.29] per year, but no effect from the proposal [-0.02 (95 percent CI -0.12 to +0.08) dose units] or acceptance of a visit [-0.03 (95 percent CI -0.15 to +0.08) dose units]. Results for metronidazole were similar, with an increase in use of 0.028 (95 percent CI +0.018 to +0.038) dose units per year. The effect of the intervention was a non-significant change in prescribing dose units of -0.005 (95 percent CI -0.025 to +0.015). Accepting a visit had little effect on prescribing: a 0.003 (95 percent CI -0.021 to +0.027) dose unit change. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of non-targeted outreach visits is probably not a valuable strategy.",0,0,
1123,Issues related to the protection of human research participants,"Making ethical decisions regarding the protection of human research participants is often complex and fraught with uncertainty and contradictions. An awareness of the fundamental principles outlined in the Belmont Report and in federal regulations and guidelines can provide a useful framework for such decisions, but the ultimate responsibility for ensuring ethical research practices rests with the individual researcher. Ongoing dialogue and discussion about these ethical issues will provide a foundation to strengthen nursing research and practice while providing maximum protection for research participants enabling the advancement of nursing science.",0,0,
1124,It is not my job to motivate hand hygiene among healthcare professionals by focusing on patients.,"Diseases often spread in hospitals because healthcare workers do not wash their hands. Research shows that it is important to highlight personal consequences for the actor in order to increase health and safety behaviors. However, because people (and healthcare professionals in particular) tend to be overconfident about personal immunity, the most effective messages about hand hygiene may be those that emphasize its consequences for other people. In two field experiments in a hospital, we compared the effectiveness of hand hygiene signs that emphasize personal safety (“Hand hygiene prevents you from getting sick”) or patient safety (“Hand hygiene prevents patients from getting sick”). We evaluated hand hygiene by measuring the amount of soap and hand sanitizer gel used from dispensers (Experiment 1) and by making confidential, independent observations of healthcare professionals' hand hygiene behaviors (Experiment 2). The results showed that changing a single word in messages resulted in meaningful changes in behavior: Health care professionals' hand hygiene increased significantly when the implications for patients were reminded, but not when reminded of the consequences themselves.",1,1,

1126,JNC-7 guidelines: still valid?,"The recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension, published in 2003 (JNC 7) are largely valid today. Targeting blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients is of primary importance in reducing cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive drugs vary in their effectiveness in lowering blood pressure and may have blood pressure-independent effects on cardiovascular events, particularly as seen in preventing heart failure and stroke. Thiazide-type diuretics have been recommended as the preferred starting agents for the treatment of hypertension in most patients, and this is still an appropriate recommendation. Several other classes were initially proposed, but beta-blockers should now have less of a role in the management of uncomplicated hypertension. While a new JNC report is reassuring for practitioners and should include some changes since JNC 7, I think most of the advice still applies today.",0,0,
1127,JOURNAL CLUB: Estimates of Provider's Response to Clinical Decision Support: Lessons Learned from the Medicare Imaging Demonstration,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of imaging clinical decision support (CDS) varies. Our aim was to identify the CDS factors that contributed to the cancellation or modification of the display order. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This pre-post study was conducted among four institutions participating in the Medicare Imaging Demonstration. Intervention was CDS at order entry for selected outpatient imaging procedures. Based on the information entered, computerized alerts notified providers whether orders were within the guidelines, whether they were appropriate, of uncertain compliance, or if they were inappropriate according to professional society guidelines. The ordering providers can override or accept the CDS. We considered actionable alerts to be alerts that could produce an immediate ordering behavior change in the ordering physician (ie, cancellation of non-compliant orders or replacement of ambiguous orders with a suggested alternative). Chi-square and logistic regression identified predictors of order cancellation or change after a warning. RESULTS: A total of 98,894 radiology orders were entered (83,114 post-intervention). In response to the warnings, providers ignored 98.9%, changed 1.1%, and canceled 0.03% of orders. Actionable alerts were 10x higher change (8.1% vs 0.7%""; p < 0.0001) or cancellation (0.2% vs. 0.2%; p < 0.02%) compared to non-actionable alerts Seven times lower cancellation or change rate of orders from institutions with pre-imaging CDS than seen at sites with newly implemented CDS (1.4% vs. 0.2%; p < 0.0001) In multivariate analysis, actionable alerts were 12 times more likely to result in order cancellation or change 7.7 times less likely to be canceled or modified with pre-existing CDS (p < 0.0001.) RESULT: Provider imaging, using results from the Medicare Imaging Demonstration project We identified potential factors associated with the CDS effect in order of magnitude; these findings may have implications for the future design of such computerized systems.",1,1,
1128,Judgments on the normative behavior of health professionals: An experimental study,"OBJECTIVES: To explore prescriptive behavioral judgments by healthcare professionals and the general public in the UK against a proliferating background of clinical guidelines and protocols. DESIGN: A questionnaire study was used in which short scenarios describing medical practice were presented to a sample of healthcare professionals and the general public. METHODS: The healthcare sample consisted of 315 nurses, doctors and midwives from three British National Health Service (NHS) Trusts who volunteered to participate in the study. A stratified sample (N = 350) of the general public was collected through a market research organization. Three types of behavior (compliance with protocol, violation of protocol, and improvisation in non-protocol) and three types of outcomes (good, bad, bad) for the patient were manipulated in nine scenarios. Participants were asked to make judgments about (1) the inappropriateness of the behavior, (2) the possibility of taking further action, and (3) the responsibility for the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that the care process has a greater impact on judgments about the behavior of health professionals than the outcome of that behavior. This was equally true for professional and public examples. CONCLUSION: The study has both theoretical and practical results. First, knowledge of a behavior's relationship to existing rules has a stronger influence on the behavior's consequences on responsibility attributions. Second, using clinical protocols as a way to manage risk in the NHS can backfire unless full compliance is achieved.",0,0,

1130,Reasonable use of antibiotics for common pediatric respiratory infections,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among common respiratory infection-producing bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis has become a major global public health concern. The use of antibiotics, whether medically justified for a particular disease or not, contributes to the development of resistant bacteria. To help control the growth of drug-resistant bacteria, the CDC and members of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently published guidelines on the judicious use of antibiotics in common pediatric respiratory infections, including the common cold, otitis media, sinusitis, and tonsillitis. . This article reviews the CDC/AAP guidelines for the management of these diseases and describes the results of clinical practice studies of efforts to improve the rational use of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The success of CDC/AAP principles in containing the increase in antimicrobial resistance depends on their application. The results of clinical practice studies show that the wise use of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric respiratory infections can be achieved through education and persistence. More widespread education and behavior change efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription and reduce the still growing problem of bacterial resistance.",0,0,

1132,Just-in-time evidence-based email 'reminders' in home health care: impact on patient outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of two knowledge-based provider reminder interventions designed to improve self-care management and outcomes for heart failure (HF) patients. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Interview and institution administrative data on 628 home care patients with primary HF diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were treated by nurses randomly assigned to usual care or to one of the two intervention groups. The key response was an email to the patient's nurse highlighting six clinical recommendations specific to HF. Augmented intervention supplemented the initial nurse reminder with additional clinician and patient resources. DATA COLLECTION: Patient interviews were conducted 45 days after admission to measure self-management behaviors, HF-specific outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-KCCQ), health-related quality of life (EuroQoL), and service use. KEY FINDINGS: Both interventions improved the mean KCCQ summary score (15.3 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively) over usual care (p< or =.05). Baseline intervention also gave a higher EuroQoL score than usual care (p< or =.05). Additionally, the interventions had a positive impact on drug knowledge, diet, and weight tracking. The basic intervention was more cost-effective than the augmented intervention in improving clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the positive effect of targeting evidence-based computer reminders to home health nurses to improve patient self-care behaviors, knowledge, and clinical outcomes.

1134,Just-in-time evidence-based email 'reminders' in home health care: impact on 'nurse practice'.,"Aim. To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve adoption of evidence-based practice by home health nurses caring for heart failure (HF) patients. Data Sources/Work Setup. Information on nurse practice was obtained from clinical records of patients admitted to the care of 354 working nurses at a large, urban, nonprofit home care institution between June 2000 and November 2001. Study design. The study used a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of the two intervention groups upon identification of an eligible patient. The key intervention was a one-time email reminder highlighting six clinical recommendations specific to HF. The augmented response consisted of provider prompts, patient education material, and an initial email reminder backed by clinical nurse expert support. Data collecting. At each home health visit to an eligible HF patient by a study nurse during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to gather information about whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the email reminder. . Key Findings. Both basic and augmented interventions have greatly increased the practice of evidence-based care based on patient registries in the areas of patient assessment and instruction on HF disease management. Although not all results were statistically significant at traditional levels, intervention effects were positive in almost all cases and effect sizes were often large. Results. The results of this randomized trial strongly support the effectiveness of just-in-time evidence-based reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among geographically dispersed home health nurses who spend most of their time in the field.",1,1,
1135,Safe and Smoke-Free in Children (KiSS): A randomized controlled trial of a multilevel intervention to reduce exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke in children.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHSe) is detrimental to children's health, but effective interventions to reduce children's SSE at home and in the car have proven difficult to implement in pediatric practice. A multilevel intervention that combines referrals from pediatric healthcare providers to behavioral counseling and pharmacological cessation aids could improve control of SHSE in pediatric populations. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial uses a randomized, two-group design with three measurement periods: pre-intervention, end-of-treatment, and 12-month follow-up. Smoking parents of children under the age of 11 are recruited from children's clinics. Clinical-level intervention involves integrating tobacco intervention guide prompts into electronic health record screens. The guidelines guide providers to ask all parents questions about child SGS, advise about the harms of SGS, and refer smokers to cessation resources. Upon receiving the clinical intervention, eligible parents are randomized to receive: (a) a 3-month telephone-based behavioral counseling intervention designed to encourage reduction of child SSH, parental smoking cessation, and navigation to access nicotine replacement therapy or cessation medication; or (b) ) an attention control nutrition education intervention. Healthcare providers and evaluators are blind to group assignments. Cotinin is used to biologically verify the child's SSH (primary outcome) and parent's dropout status. DISCUSSION: This study tests an innovative, multi-level approach to reducing child SSI. The approach is sustainable because clinics can easily integrate tobacco response alerts with ""ask, recommend, and refer"" guidelines into electronic health records and refer smokers to free evidence-based behavioral counseling interventions, such as government quit lines.

1136,"Kindergarten readiness after prematurity: Integrating health, development and behavioral functioning to optimize the educational outcomes of vulnerable children","In the last 20 years, many advances (eg, maternal steroids and surfactant) have changed the course of neonatal medicine. As a result, infants born extremely prematurely survive medical complications that were previously fatal. After discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, preterm infants can continue to experience a range of medical and developmental challenges, and their families are faced with the daunting task of feeding a vulnerable child. Families may be referred to multiple care systems, including primary care physicians, pediatric subspecialists, and early intervention services. The ultimate goal of preterm infants is to optimize their motor, communicative, social-emotional and adaptive development, as well as to encourage their learning at home, at school and in the community. As children move to school, key indicators of their functional status include the amount of developmental, educational, habilitative and behavioral support they need to participate in learning activities with their peers. Success can be measured by whether preterm infants are ready for large group learning with their peers and the extent of support needed to make this important transition. The purpose of this review is to explain what is known about certain indicators of school readiness in preterm infants, including neurodevelopmental disorders, social-emotional skills, and social factors. We conclude this transition with guidelines for using it as an important indicator of developmental trajectories that can help us better understand risk and resilience in this vulnerable child population.",0,0,
1137,"Knowledge, attitudes and use of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening among family physicians","BACKGROUND: The results of the National Lung Screening Trial showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality when high-risk patients were screened with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). (CXR). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has issued a class B recommendation for LDCT screening, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers now cover the cost of screening under certain circumstances. The aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and use of LDCT screening for lung cancer among family physicians. METHODS: A 32-item questionnaire was distributed to members of the South Carolina Academy of Family Physicians in 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There were 101 participants, and most had incorrect information about which organizations recommended screening. Many doctors continued to recommend CXR for lung cancer screening. Most felt that LDCT scanning increased the likelihood of detecting the disease at an earlier stage (98%) and the benefits outweighed the harms (75%). Concerns included unnecessary procedures (88%), stress/anxiety (52%), and radiation exposure (50%). Most physicians in some capacity discussed the risks/benefits of screening with their patients (76%), but more than 50% reported recommending 1 or no screening in the last year.

1138,Knowledge translation of research findings,"Background One of the most consistent findings from clinical and healthcare research is the failure to translate research into practice and policy. As a result of these evidence-practice and policy gaps, patients are not optimally exploited by advances in healthcare and are exposed to unnecessary risks of iatrogenic harm, and healthcare systems incur unnecessary expenditures resulting in significant opportunity costs. In the last decade, there has been increasing international policy and research interest in how to reduce the evidence-practice and policy gap. In this article, we summarize current concepts and evidence to guide knowledge translation activities, defined as T2 research (transformation of new clinical knowledge into better health). We structure the article around five key questions: what should be conveyed""; to whom should research knowledge be conveyed; by whom should research knowledge be conveyed; how should research knowledge be conveyed;"" and with what effect should research knowledge be transferred? Discussion We suggest that the basic unit of knowledge translation should often be current systematic reviews or other syntheses of research findings. Knowledge translators need to identify key messages for different audiences and shape them into language and information translation products that can be easily assimilated by different audiences. The relative importance of knowledge translation for different audiences will vary with the type of research, and the appropriate endpoints of knowledge translation may differ between different stakeholder groups. There are many models of planned information translation derived from different disciplinary, contextual (i.e. setting) and audience perspectives. Most suggest that planned information translation for healthcare professionals and consumers is more likely to be successful if the choice of information translation strategy is informed by an assessment of potential barriers and facilitators. While our evidence for the possible effectiveness of different strategies to overcome specific barriers is lacking, there is an important (if incomplete) evidence base to guide the selection of information translation activities targeting healthcare professionals and consumers (eg, research use by policy makers). The evidence base for the effects of different approaches to information translation targeting policy makers and senior executives is much weaker, but there are many innovative approaches warranting further evaluation.",0,0,
1139,Information translation of the American College of Emergency Physicians' clinical policy on syncope using computerized clinical decision support.,"OBJECTIVES: To influence physician practice behavior after implementation of a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the recommendations in the 2007 ACEP Syncope Clinical Policy. METHODS: This was a post-post intervention with a prospective cohort and retrospective controls. We performed a medical picture review of consecutive adult patients with syncope. A computerized CDSS was embedded in the emergency room information system (EDIS) that prompted physicians to explain their decision regarding imaging and admission in syncope patients based on ACEP Clinical Policy recommendations. Medical records of 410 consecutive adult patients presenting with syncope were reviewed before the application and 301 records were reviewed after the application. The primary outcomes were physician practice behavior as indicated by the acceptance rate and head computed tomography (CT) imaging rate before and after administration. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in pre- and post-intervention acceptance rates (68.1% vs. 60.5%, respectively, p = 0.036). There was no significant difference in the rate of head CT imaging before and after the intervention (39.8% vs. 43.2%, p = 0.358). There were seven doctors who saw ten or more patients before and after the intervention. A subgroup analysis of the practice behavior of these seven physicians revealed a slight significant difference in pre- and post-intervention acceptance rates (74.3% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.0495), and there was no significant difference in pre- and post-intervention head CT scan rate. -intervention (42.9% vs. 45.4%, p = 0.660). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of an evidence-based CDSS based on ACEP Clinical Policy recommendations on syncope is associated with a change in physician practice behavior in an urban academic emergency department. This change demonstrates that emergency medicine clinical practice guideline recommendations can be incorporated into the physician workflow of an EDIS to improve the quality of practice.",1,1,
1140,Knowledge versus practice: the necessity of education for successful guideline implementation,"This study evaluated physicians' familiarity with a practice guideline for bronchiolitis, evaluated their attitudes towards the guidelines, determined the preference of educational materials for guideline accessibility, and examined the relationship between guideline familiarity and attitudes to clinical practice behaviors. Six months after the implementation of the guideline, questionnaires were distributed to eligible physicians. The response rate was 68%. Retrospective analyzes of inhalation therapies were also performed in the three study cohorts. Most physicians surveyed in this study were aware of and used a recently introduced guideline, although the use of unproven inhalation therapies continued. Despite proven maintenance efficiency, continuing education intervention is required to sustain these gains.",0,0,
1141,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding breast cancer screening in educated Appalachian women","OBJECTIVE/TARGET: To determine how and what women learn about breast cancer and screening practices, and what factors affect women's breast cancer screening practices. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of survey data collected during enrollment in a clinical trial. SETTING: Breast care center of the Mid-Atlantic academic health sciences center. EXAMPLE: 185 women in a predominantly Appalachian, purely rural state. METHODS: Participants completed the Modified Toronto Breast Self-Exam Inventory and questions about personal mammography practices at enrollment prior to randomization in a longitudinal clinical intervention study. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Women's demographics, knowledge of breast cancer screening practices, adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines, and motivation, knowledge, and practice proficiency related to breast cancer screening. RESULTS: These educated women had a lack of knowledge about breast cancer, breast cancer risk factors and screening guidelines, especially timing of breast self-examination and practice behaviors. Women who received health care and cancer screening training by healthcare providers, including advanced practice nurses, had more knowledge about breast cancer and detection practices. CONCLUSION: Women still lack information about breast cancer, breast cancer detection and personal risk factors. Additionally, some educated women in this study failed to screen for breast cancer according to current guidelines. PRACTICES FOR NURSING: Practitioners should continue to remind and update women about breast diseases, and women's cancer screening practices should be strengthened. Providers at all levels should increase their rate of clinical breast examination with physical examination. Nurses, who greatly affect women's health care, should keep their knowledge of breast disease, screening and treatment up to date.",0,0,
1142,KRAS and colorectal cancer: ethical and pragmatic issues impacting real-time change in oncology clinical trials and practice,"Systemic therapy led to a median survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) almost four times longer than would be expected with the best supportive care; this is a result obtained by combining chemotherapeutic and targeted biological agents. While the latter may contain anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab, we now have strong evidence that patients whose tumors harbor mutated KRAS will not benefit from this class of substances. It took several years for the reliability and importance of the KRAS data to be acknowledged, for a variety of reasons. Timeline from the presentation and publication of small, retrospective phase II studies to widespread acceptance of the predictive value of KRAS and behavior-specific changes, modifications of ongoing national trials in advanced/metastatic CRC, changes and adjustments in national guidelines and practice models, according to labeled indications for monoclonal antibodies it was long. In this review, we discuss whether the data disclosure process regarding KRAS status and treatment of advanced CRC patients is effective in allowing timely decision regarding ongoing publicly funded clinical trials, and whether such decisions are rational and ethical. The overall goals are to highlight lessons learned in the review and adoption of new scientific data, as well as early disclosure of clinical trial results, and suggest changes to deal with similar situations in the future.",0,0,
1143,Laboratory test form design influences test ordering by GPs in the Netherlands,"The effect of listing fewer laboratory tests on the test request form on the test ordering behavior of a group of 47 Dutch GPs was examined. The number of laboratory tests ordered by this experimental group over a 12-month period was recorded. The usual, old standard form was used by a control group of 28 GPs at a different site. After using the old standard form containing 178 tests for 5 months, the experimental group was given forms containing only 15 hematological and chemical tests plus a few urine and stool tests, making room for ""others"". Comparison of the experimental and control periods showed that the number of tests ordered monthly decreased by 18 in the experimental group. When the usual standard form was reintroduced, GPs quickly reverted to their old models. The results revealed that the fixed and often unsound routine influences the use of additional diagnostic procedures. Additionally, limiting and reconfiguring test order forms may break the routine, but it does not fundamentally change the logic of test ordering behavior.",1,1,
1144,Lack of schedule reminder effectiveness on family medicine resident JNC-VI and NCEP III guideline knowledge and attitudes,"BACKGROUND: The literature shows that medical residents and general practitioners have an attitudinal-behavioral mismatch regarding the positive attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and their application to clinical practice models. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to determine whether a change in a predefined CPG compliance factor (accessibility) would result in a significant increase in family medicine resident knowledge and attitude towards guidelines. The primary study intervention included inserting a summary of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) Sixth Report and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Blood Pressure. Adult High Blood Cholesterol (NCEP III) CPGs in all patient (>18 years) charts for a three-month period. JNC VI and NCEP III CPGs were also distributed to each Wayne State family medicine resident, and a copy of each CPG was placed in the instructor's area of their respective clinics. Regarding CPG knowledge and attitude, the same questionnaires were administered to all residents before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Post-intervention analysis failed to show any significant difference in CPG information. A statistically significant difference was found only in the attitude question after the intervention. Barriers to CPG compliance 1) lack of CPG instruction""; 2) lack of critical evaluation capability; 3) insufficient time; 4) lack of CPG accessibility;"" and 5) lack of faculty modeling. CONCLUSION: This study showed that there was no significant change in CPG knowledge after intervention and only one question reflecting attitude change. Wider established access to private clinical time, increased faculty modeling, and implementation of an electronic record/reminder system using a team-based approach are compliance factors to be considered for further research. Interpretation of CPG non-compliance would benefit from a causal matrix focused on physician knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Recent findings in established knowledge-behavior dissonance may steer future research of physician CPG mismatch away from generalized barrier research and towards the development of information that maximizes the individual practitioner's sense of urgency and certainty.",0,1,

DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire sent to 1,000 primary care physicians in the state of Michigan. SETTING: The questionnaire was sent to physicians practicing general internal medicine or family medicine. PARTICIPANTS: The questionnaire was sent to 500 MD and 500 DO physicians""; general internal medicine and family medicine were given equal representation. 60% (n = 604) of 1000 physicians responded, 51% (n = 309) were MDs. , % 48 (n = 295) were DOs, 41% (n = 245) were general internists and 59% (n = 359) were family physicians MEASUREMENTS AND KEY RESULTS: Despite positive attitudes towards diagnosis and treatment skills depression in the elderly, only a quarter of respondents routinely used a screening tool in practice. Forty-one percent of all physicians were unaware of depression practice guidelines. Family physicians were more confident in their treatment skills than general internists (85%). vs 50%;"" chi 2 = 11.42, p < or = .003). Male physicians more frequently favored pharmacological therapy, while female physicians more frequently used counseling and exercise techniques to treat depressed older patients. Half of all doctors felt knowledgeable about community resources for treating older depressed patients. RESULTS: This survey identified several perceived needs for future targeted interventions: (1) exposure to additional Healthcare Policy and Research Institute guidance for all primary care physicians, (2) targeted counseling skills intervention for male physicians, and medication management for female physicians. and (3) additional continuing medical education intervention for general internists. In order to fully understand the nature of older depression treatment in primary care, more research is needed to link physician attitudes with follow-up behaviors.",0,0,

1147,Learning Assessment: blending quality improvement and application research methods to examine innovations in health,"Background In healthcare change interventions, on-site learning about the implementation process is often lost because of the primary focus on outcome improvements. This article describes Learning Assessment, a methodological approach that blends quality improvement and application research methods to examine innovations in healthcare. Methods Learning Assessment is an approach to multi-organizational assessment. Qualitative and quantitative data are collected to make real-time assessment of implementation processes as well as to evaluate changes in context, facilitate quality improvement using worksheets, supervision and feedback, and create portable lessons. The basis of this approach are five principles: (1) ""collect data to describe changes made by healthcare organizations and how changes are implemented""; (2) collect process and outcome data on healthcare organizations and research team; (3) evaluate practice, process, outcome, and portability. Multi-level contextual factors affecting (4) help healthcare organizations use data for continuous quality improvement and (5) operationalize common measurement strategies to produce portable results (1) provide a detailed understanding of the current implementation plan; (2) target audiences identify and monitor relevant process measures; (3) collect and analyze real-time quantitative and qualitative data on key contextual factors; (4) synthesize and continually share data and emerging findings with stakeholders; and (5) harmonize learning from process and outcome data. to enable and encourage primary care and behavioral s Application to a multi-site program focused on network integration demonstrates the feasibility and utility of Learning Assessment for generating real-time insights into evolving implementation processes. Conclusions Learning Evaluation produces systematic and rigorous inter-organizational findings on the implementation of innovations in health, while also increasing institutional capacity and facilitating continuous learning at individual sites, accelerating the translation of findings. Researchers evaluating change initiatives and health organizations implementing improvement initiatives can benefit from the Learning Assessment approach.",0,0,
1148,Learning with computer guides in general practice? A Randomly Controlled Experiment.,"Background. Evidence-based guidelines are seen as an important tool to transfer scientifically produced knowledge into daily clinical practice and to provide high standards of clinical care. Despite being widely publicized, clinical guidelines so far have had limited impact on individual professional learning and changing daily medical practice. targets. Our aim was to (i) examine a potential increase in knowledge among German GPs after the implementation of web and evidence-based guidelines, and (ii) identify and analyze potential barriers to individual professional learning with computerized guidelines. Methods A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 72 GPs (21% female, 79% male). The intervention group (n = 38) had access to clinical guidelines via the internet or CD-ROM, while the control group (n = 34) did not. Both groups received a standardized two-part questionnaire. Knowledge increase was measured with 25 multiple-choice questions on four different medical topics. In addition, the reasons for using or not using the computerized guides were analyzed after access to the guides was made available to all participating physicians. Results. There was no significant increase in knowledge in the intervention group (P = 0.69). Twenty-two (58%) practitioners of the intervention group used the guidelines. Unspecified curiosity (76%) and a specific medical question (38%) were the predominant reasons for use among physicians using the guidelines. Among 'non-users', 78% cited 'lack of time' as the main reason for not using the guides. Solution. An efficient information transfer could not be achieved through computerized guides. Use, individual learning and potential application depend on adequate incentives and pragmatic aspects of clinical practice: easy and fast access.",0,1,

1152,Lessons from a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate computer decision support software to improve asthma management,"Primary purpose: To investigate whether computer decision support software used in the treatment of asthmatic patients improves clinical outcomes. Research design: Randomized controlled trial with practices each reporting 30 patients with asthma over a 6-month period. Methods and procedures: 447 patients were randomly selected from practice asthma registries managed by 17 general practices across the UK. Intervention apps did not use control apps while using software during consultations with these patients throughout the study. Main results and conclusions: Practice consultations, acute exacerbations of asthma, hospital contacts, assessment and symptoms related to medication use. A smaller proportion of patients in the intervention group initiated practice consultations for their asthma: 34 (22%) vs 111 (34%), odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.37-0.95) )""; "" and experienced acute asthma exacerbations: 12 (8%) vs 57 (17%), OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.21-0.85, six months after the introduction of computer decision support software.

1153,Lessons learned from the evaluation of the UK's NHS R&D Practice Methods Programme,"Background Concern over the effective use of research was a major factor behind the creation of the NHS R&D Programme in 1991. In 1994, an advisory group was formed to identify research priorities in research practice. This resulted in the Implementation Methods Program (IMP), and the commissioning group funded 36 projects. In 2000, responsibility for the program was transferred from the Brunel University Health Economics Research Group (HERG) to the National Coordinating Center for NHS Service Delivery and Organization R&D, which requested an evaluation in 2002. By then most projects had been completed. . This assessment aimed to cover: the quality of the deliverables, the lessons to be learned about the communication strategy and the deployment process, and the benefits from the projects. Methods We have adopted a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative methods. These include: documentary analysis, interviews with key actors, surveys of funded lead researchers, surveys of potential users, and table analysis. Results Quantitative evaluation of outcomes and dissemination revealed that some funded beneficial research projects with significant impact across several categories in the HERG reimbursement model, such as publications, further research, research education, impact on health policy, and clinical practice. . Qualitative findings from interviews with advisory and commissioning group members showed that practice research was a relatively unexplored field when the IMP was established. This is reflected in the understanding brought to their roles by members of advisory and commissioning groups, the way research priorities are selected and developed, and how research projects are commissioned. Ideological and methodological debates about these decisions continued among those working in this field. The need for an effective communication strategy was particularly important to the program as a whole. However, such a strategy has never been developed, making it difficult to establish the overall impact of the IMP as a program. Conclusion Our findings on the impact of funded work and the challenges faced by IMP developers have implications for the development of strategic research programs in general and for the development of more effective research in this area.",0,0,

1155,Leveraging insights from behavioral economics to increase the value of healthcare delivery,"United States healthcare spending continues to increase at unsustainable rates. A recent move to increase price transparency has been proposed, through legislative efforts at both the state and federal levels, as a way to curb the rate of increase in spending. While this may seem like a good idea on the surface, simply informing doctors, especially interns, about prices may not achieve the kind of drastic changes in practice models that advocates expect. The way price transparency is implemented will likely play an important role in its effectiveness as an intervention. In this article, the authors review transparency efforts and assumed options from other contexts, and draw on insights from behavioral economics to provide recommendations for increasing the likelihood that price transparency will lead physicians to weigh the relative value of interventions.",0,1,

Treatment adaptations focused on reducing minority stress processes that underlie mental health disparities related to sexual orientation. METHODS: Young gay and bisexual men (n = 63"";"" Age = 25.94) were randomized to emergency treatment or a 3-month waiting list. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments, participants completed self-reports on mental health and minority stress, and a past 90-day interview on risk behavior. RESULTS: Treatment versus waiting list significantly reduced depressive symptoms (b = -2.43, 95% CI: -4.90, 0.35, p < .001), alcohol use problems (b = -3.79, 95% CI: -5.94, -1.64). substantially reduced. , p < .001), sexual compulsion (b = -5.09, 95% CI: -8.78, -1.40, p < .001), and condomless sex with casual partners in the last 90 days (b = -1.09, 95%) CI: - 1.80, -0.37, p < .001) and improved condom use self-efficacy (b = 10.08, 95% CI: 3.86, 16.30, p < .001). Treatment was moderate and marginally significant according to the waiting list in anxiety symptoms (b = -2.14, 95% CI: -4.61, 0.34, p = .09) and excessive alcohol consumption in the last 90 days (b = -0.32, 95%). improved further CI: -0.71, 0.07, p = .09). The effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Minority stress processes showed minor improvements in the expected direction. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated preliminary support for first response adapted to address the co-occurring health problems of gay and bisexual men in minority stress at the source. If found to be effective compared to standard evidence-based treatments, the treatment will have significant potential to help clinicians translate LGB-positive treatment guidelines into evidence-based practice.

Hypertension is treated to prevent cardiovascular disease"";"" that's why we place emphasis on documentation as important endpoints. The validity of documents for general application is evaluated. We also evaluated whether certain methods or theories for behavior change could be helpful to the GP. CONCLUSIONS: The value of advice against smoking, dietary advice (increased intake of grain products, vegetables, fruit, poultry and fish), and advice on exercise is well documented and applicable in general practice. Respect for the patient's autonomy and concern for patients and their health-related habits appear to be important factors for increasing the doctor's chances of influencing patient behavior.

PARTICIPANTS: All 20-70-year-old hypercholesterolemic subjects who were not eligible for statin therapy according to guidelines and were seen on 12 predetermined working days”; 713 patients; 94 GPs. INTERVENTION: Short (5-10 min.) ) educational intervention (qualitative dietary advice, walking or promoting other aerobic physical activities);"" to give simple dietary advice at the discretion of the doctor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cholesterol level and global CV risk calculated according to the Framingham equation. RESULTS: Total cholesterol and global CV risk (10 years) were 0.31 mmol/l (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.23-0.40) and 1.35% (p < 0.01, %), respectively. The 95 CI was decreased from -1.73 to -0.97), after a 54-month follow-up. Registered patients showed greater reductions in total cholesterol than control patients: 2.24% (p < 0.05, 95% CI 0.58-3.91%).

Current research shows that reorienting health services towards health promotion is difficult. The aim of this study was to explore the scope of the health care professional's work with lifestyle interventions in Swedish primary care and to describe professional knowledge, attitudes and perceived organizational support for lifestyle interventions. METHODS: The study is based on a web-based cross-sectional survey of GPs, fellow doctors, residents, public health nurses, and registered nurses (n = 315) in primary care. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of the participants stated that lifestyle interventions were an important part of their task. The majority (77%) want to work more with their patient lifestyle. Health professionals often reported that they had extensive knowledge of lifestyle intervention methods for disease prevention. Significant differences were found between the professional groups in terms of specific knowledge and lifestyle interventions and the scope of the study. Alcohol was the least addressed lifestyle habit. Management was supportive, but there were few structures to sustain work with lifestyle interventions and the need for national guidelines was identified. RESULTS: Health professionals reported extensive knowledge and positive attitudes towards lifestyle interventions. Planning for further implementation of lifestyle interventions in primary health care should take into account information, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the provision of institutional support, such as national guidelines, and differences among professional groups in the scope of work and lifestyle issues.",0,0,
1161,Lifestyle or lifesaving drugs? Primary care and consumer opinion research on over-the-counter statins,"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter (OTC) simvastatin 10 mg was made available in the UK in July 2004 to improve primary prevention of ischemic heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To document the views of key stakeholders (general practitioners [GPs], community pharmacists and consumers) on issues related to the reclassification of simvastatin to OTC availability, highlight differences among stakeholder groups, and identify factors likely to influence consumer behavior. METHODS: A self-administered survey of GPs, community pharmacists and potentially eligible consumers was conducted 8 months after OTC simvastatin launch in the UK. Participants were asked about their awareness of the drug, their willingness to use these drugs, and their views on related management practices. RESULTS: Awareness of OTC simvastatin was high among GPs, but limited among consumers. Although OTC availability is favored by pharmacists, consumers and GPs often thought it was not a good idea. GPs and pharmacists cited increased consumer choice as the most important possible benefit"";"" consumers felt that the potential savings to the National Health Service were equally significant. Abuse of drugs and neglect of lifestyle risk factors were unanimously considered the most important possible risks. In contrast to the majority of pharmacists, most GPs felt that current dosing guidelines were not appropriate, but there was consensus that prolonged non-compliance would likely reduce any therapeutic benefit. Most respondents agreed that GPs should be informed if their patients were using OTC statins, but disagreed on the best way to communicate this information. CONCLUSIONS: The OTC availability of statins was not considered a popular public health intervention by consumers and GPs, as the drugs were widely perceived to be prone to abuse. However, the OTC availability was favored by pharmacists who saw it as a booster for both consumers and themselves. Key issues regarding the deployment, management and evaluation of the public health impact of this intervention remain unresolved.",0,0,

1163,'Like sugar and honey': The embedded ethics of a larval control project in Gambia,"This article describes a malaria research project in The Gambia that encourages reflection on the social value of transnational research. The Larval Control Project (LCP) investigated the efficacy of a microbial insecticide to reduce vector density and ultimately clinical malaria in Gambian children. The LCP's protocol defined a clinical surveillance plan involving Rural Health Workers (VHWs) supported by project nurses. Combining insights from ethnographic fieldwork conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in Farafenni from 2005 to 2009, open-ended interviews with project nurses, and eight focus group discussions with participating mothers in October 2007, LCP's several years of research research method against the background of his activity. We found that while participants associated LCP with the clinical care it provides, they felt that collaboration between nurses and VHWs provided additional benefits. Small-scale collaborations organized around the operational functions of the trial provided the platform on which to build local capacity. While ethical guidelines highlight aspects that need to be added to experimental efforts in southern countries (for example, elaborating informed consent processes, developing community engagement strategies, or providing therapeutic access to participants after trial ends), these findings suggest a shift of attention away from ethical reinforcement. Protocols for everyday research work—embedding ethics through scientific activity—can provide a more solid basis for reinforcing the relationship between scientific rigor and societal value.",0,0,

DESIGN: Times series cohort study. SETTING: Four academic health centers in the New York metropolitan area. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive adults hospitalized for pneumonia during a 5-month period before (n = 1.013) and after (n = 1.081) implementation of the inpatient quality improvement (QI) intervention. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team of opinion leaders developed evidence-based treatment guidelines and critical pathways, held training sessions with physicians, distributed pocket reminder cards, supported standardized orders, and developed bilingual patient education materials. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean age was 71.4%, with 44.1% low risk, 36.8% medium risk, and 19.2% high risk. The pre-intervention and post-intervention groups were well matched for age, sex, race, hospice residence, pneumonia severity, initial presentation, and most major comorbidities. The intervention increased the use of antimicrobial therapy recommended by the guideline from 78.1% to 83.4% (p = 0.003). There was also a borderline decrease in the proportion of patients discharged before clinical stabilization from 27.0% to 23.5% (p = 0.06). However, there were no improvements in other targeted indicators, including time to first antibiotic dose, rate of taking antibiotics within 8 hours, timely switching to oral antibiotics, timely discharge, length of hospital stay, or patient education outcomes. RESULTS: This real-world QI program was able to show modest improvement in some quality indicators, but did not affect resource use or patient knowledge of their disease.

1165,Local clinical guidelines: description and evaluation of a participatory method for their development and implementation,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines rarely follow abrupt changes in clinical behavior. We present our experience of an active training method for local development and the implementation of a guideline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory method for developing local clinical guidelines. METHODS: A trial in a region of the impact of guideline development involving the active involvement of targeted buyers on subsequent relevant prescribing. It was conducted in 69 general practices, covering a population of 345,763 in the Wirral Family Healthcare Institute region (Wirral peninsula). An exemplary guide on 'hypertension in the elderly' has been developed with the method described. The main drug recommended was bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily. Differences in prescribed daily doses (PDD) of bendrofluazide 2.5 mg tablets per quarter per 1000 prescribing units (age-weighted population) were measured between the region of intervention and the UK as a whole. RESULTS: Comparison of intervention region with UK data shows a median difference of 122.49 PDD before guideline and 206.34 PDD after, this change is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney two-tailed P < 0.0001""; 95% CI = 36.51-104.77 Grouped regression analysis, it does not show a significant difference in slope slopes before guide production (0.89) (P = 0.35, 95% CI = -3.97-5.76), but the difference in slope slopes after (12.95) is statistically significant (P < 0.0001;"" 95% CI = 8.17) -17.73.

1166,Local Learning Collaborators to Improve Quality for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): From Four Regional Practice-based Research Networks (PBRNs),"BACKGROUND: Four practice-based research networks (PBRNs) have participated in a project to increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A multi-component organizational response deployed regionally close primary care practices in a series of facilitated meetings called local learning collaborators (LLCs). METHODS: The 2 wave strategy started with 8 applications receiving application facilitation in each PBRN and then joining an LLC. A sequential mixed method design that addresses the behavior, content, and fidelity of the intervention"";"" Clinicians at 2 PBRN attended the interviews and PBRN coordinators reflected on the implementation challenges. RESULTS: LLCs were formed in 3 PBRNs and 121 monthly meetings were held in 20 LLCs. Just over half of the participants were clinicians. Qualitative data show that clinicians increase priority for CKD care, improve their knowledge and skills, are satisfied with the project, and strive to improve care. Implementation challenges were encountered and sustainability concerns were raised. CONCLUSION: While PBRNs can successfully use resources to disseminate treatment guidelines and LLCs are well accepted by clinical staff, formation of LLCs was not feasible for 1 PBRN and others struggled to meet regularly and have performance data despite logistical support .",0,0,
1167,Long-term efficacy in prescribing two multifaceted educational interventions: results from two large-scale randomized cluster studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Knowledge about the benefits and risks of drugs is an important factor influencing physicians' prescribing decisions. Outreach visits that promote independent information have proven moderately effective in changing prescribing behaviors. OBJECTIVES: To test the short- and long-term effectiveness of pharmacist-led small group meetings on general practitioners' prescribing. METHODS: Two sets of open randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted in a large-scale NHS setting. We used tentative evidence-based materials taking into account a therapeutic area approach - TEA, which includes informational materials on osteoporosis or prostatic hyperplasia - and information materials on me-too drugs from 2 different classes, as well as a single-drug approach - SIDRO: barnidipine or prulifloxacin. In each study, all 115 Primary Care Groups (2.2 million population, 1737 GPs) in a Northern Italian region were randomized to educational small group meetings presenting available evidence along with drug use data and clinical scenarios. The main results were changes in the six-month prescription of targeted drugs. Longer-term outcomes (24 and 48 months) were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the TEA study, one of the four primary outcomes was reduced (alfuzosin prescription compared to tamsulosin and terazosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia: prescribing rate -8.5%, p = 0.03). Another primary outcome (risedronate prescription) showed a reduction at 24 and 48 months (-7.6%, p = 0.02"" and -9.8%, p = 0.03) but not at six months (-5.1%, p = 0.36) in the SIDRO study, both primary outcomes showed a statistically significant reduction (barnidipine prescription -9.8%, p = 0.02;"" prulifloxacin prescription -11.1%, p=0.04), which persisted or increased over time. COMMENT: These two clusters of RCTs demonstrated the large-scale feasibility of a complex education program in an NHS setting and the potentially relevant long-term impact on prescribing habits, particularly when focusing on a single drug. National Health systems should invest in independent drug information programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN05866587.",0,0,

1169,Long-term effects of asthma education given to physicians on patient satisfaction and utilization of health services.,"This randomized clinical trial evaluated the long-term impact of an interactive seminar for physicians based on principles of self-regulation on clinician behavior, children's use of healthcare for asthma, and parents' views on physician performance. Seventy-four general practice pediatricians and 637 asthma patients aged 1-12 years were randomized to treatment or control. Children and parents were blind to the involvement of doctors. Data were collected through baseline and self-administered questionnaires (pediatricians), telephone interviews (parents), and medical records. The seminar focused on the development of communication and teaching skills and the use of therapeutic medical regimens for asthma, as outlined in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. At approximately 2 years after intervention, treatment group physicians were more likely than control physicians to use protocols to provide asthma education (odds ratio (OR) 4.9, p=0.2), to write to patients how to adjust medication when symptoms change (OR 5.7, p=0.05) and provides further guidelines for changing therapy (OR 3.8, p=0.06). Parents rated treatment group doctors higher than control doctors on five specific positive communication behaviors. Children seen by treatment group physicians had fewer hospitalizations (p=0.03), and those who used higher levels of ED at baseline had fewer subsequent emergency room visits (p=0.03). No difference was noted regarding the number of office visits. There was no significant difference between the treatment and control group physicians in terms of time spent with patients during office visits (26 versus 29 minutes) or the number of patients treated with anti-inflammatory medication. It was concluded that interactive asthma seminars for pediatricians have significant long-term benefits for asthma care.",0,0,

METHODS: A prospective discontinuous time series study evaluating the efficacy of a multifaceted, phased intervention over 4 years in a large urban pediatric referral hospital. Safe pediatric prescribing guidelines were implemented using an evidence-based model. Key components included early clinician involvement and improved multidisciplinary communication, consensus building, interactive training, and timely data feedback using iterative Plan-Do-Run-Act cycles. The effect on medication error and harm (adverse drug events, [ADEs]) was measured using standard definitions and a multi-method approach. Potential data from volunteer reports by nursing, medical, and pharmacy staff and intensive chart review were combined. All data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel, including causality assessments for ADEs. RESULTS: There were 1011 patients with 6651 drug orders reviewed over 3 time periods. Total ADEs were reduced by >50% in the first year and maintained at 4 years. The greatest improvements were in potential ACEs, which decreased from 12.26 per 100 patients at baseline to 4.60 per 100 patients at 4 years (P < .05). Total medication errors decreased from 4.51 per 100 orders at baseline to 2.78 per 100 orders over 4 years (P < .05).

Methods An experimental design between and between subjects with manipulations of CPI presentation formats. We recruited both consumers of lower socioeconomic status (SES)/cognitive skills and consumers of higher SES/cognitive skills through an online access panel. Participants were given a fictitious CPI and completed questions on interpretation and use of information. Among subjects, (1) displaying an overall performance score (yes/no)""; (2) showing few quality indicators (5 out of 9);"" and (3) displaying different types of evaluative symbols (star ratings, colored dots, and word symbols versus numbers and bar graphs). Within subjects, we tested the effect of a reduced number of healthcare providers (5 vs. 20). Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, analyzes of variance, and paired-sample t-tests. Results A total of 902 (43%) participants participated. The display of an overall performance score and the use of colored dots and word symbols especially improved consumer understanding. More importantly, respondents provided with colored dots most frequently ranked first when compared to word symbols (76.6% correct), star ratings (70.6% correct), numbers (62.0%), and bars (54.2%). correctly selected three health care providers (84.3%).

To ensure safety in the healthcare system and to create a strong radiation protection environment for patients (and staff), there must be a strong safety culture. To understand an organization's behavior, decisions, and actions, it is important to examine its cultural values. The purpose of this study was to discuss how values, attitudes and norms influence the decisions of radiologists as well as the application of various radiation protection measures. To explore this, focus group interviews and in-depth individual interviews were conducted on a sample from a number of radiology departments in hospitals in Sweden. The results show that the core value is obtained from the patients' perspective, which focuses on the knowledge that patients come to the healthcare system for a specific reason: to discover the disease or, at best, to be declared healthy. The majority's attitudes were based on experience with aspects that the radiologist could not influence. This is often related to the increasing pressure on radiology research from clinics in various operational units. Under the concept of norms, the radiologists in the study demanded that the development of regulations and guidelines be linked to justification issues for various radiological inquiries.",0,0,
1179,"Practices against malaria policies, a reality check from Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo","BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is recommended following a parasitological diagnosis approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Congo National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). However, the commitment and competence of all stakeholders (patients, medical professionals, governments and funders) is required to perform effective case management and ensure the ""beneficial therapeutic life"" of proposed drugs. The health-seeking behaviors of the patients and the practices of health professionals for malaria management were evaluated. METHODS: This was an observational study embedded in a two-stage cluster randomized questionnaire conducted at a health center (HC) in each of 12 selected health districts in the city of Kinshasa. All patients diagnosed with clinical malaria were eligible. Health-seeking behaviors were recorded in a specific questionnaire alongside the practices of health care practitioners. The latter was unaware that their applications would be evaluated. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty-four patients, 136 (21.8%) under the age of five, were evaluated. Three hundred and thirty-five (55%) had taken medication before the current consultation (self-medication with any product or visiting another HC), 47 (14%) took antimalarial medication, and 56 (9%) hypothetically treated. . Of these, 53.6% received monotherapy with quinine, artesunate, phyto-drugs, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine. On the other hand, when clinicians were informed about the laboratory results, 39.9% of confirmed malaria cases were prescribed monotherapy. Only 285 patients (45.7%) were treated in accordance with WHO and NMCP guidelines, of which 120 (19.2%) were prescribed ACT after a positive blood smear and 165 (26.4%) after a negative result did not receive. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the contradiction between malaria policies in Kinshasa and the realities in the field in terms of health-seeking behaviors of patients and practices of health professionals. Consequently, poor policy compliance may contribute to the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug resistance and may also have a negative impact on the burden of the disease.",0,0,

1191,Management of severe hypertension in France in 1999 and 2000: interim results of a health insurance intervention program.,"OBJECTIVE: As part of a long-term public health program aimed at improving the clinical management of hypertension (HBP), French health funds conducted two nationwide surveys of affiliates that had recently been waived contributions for severe hypertension. The aim was to measure the difference between observed clinical management and benchmarking care at baseline (May 1999) and during the program (November 1999), as defined by the 1997 ANAES guidelines (National Agency for Accreditation and Health Evaluation). any change in clinical management between the two study periods, the time frame corresponding to the intervention period. METHODS: Samples of patients used in the two studies included affiliates aged 20 to 80 years who lived in France or one of its overseas territories and were recently exempted from paying co-pay (ETM) for severe hypertension (these patients were 100% reimbursed). for all maintenance related to the disorder). The assessment was based on retrospective data provided by the attending physicians. Indicators isolated to compare the two study periods were blood pressure control, recommended lifestyle changes, and prescribed medications. RESULTS: The first survey was conducted between May and November 1999 and enrolled 10,665 patients (corresponding to a weighted patient population of 50,383), the second surveyed 2,649 patients in November 2000. Study population in 1999, on average, study population in November 2000: 63.1 years +/- 0.2 versus 65.4 years +/- 0.4. Almost two out of three patients had at least one other major cardiovascular risk factor in addition to HBP (smoking, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia): 63.9% in 1999 and 64.4% in 2000. Approximately one in seven patients had associated coronary artery disease. : 14.1% in 1999 and 15.3% in 2000 and more than one in ten had associated cerebrovascular disease: 12.7% in 1999 and 12.2% in 2000. The 1999 group had more diabetes patients than the 2000 group: 27.5% +/- 1.0 vs 23.9% +/- 1.6. The proportion of patients with poor blood pressure control (systolic >140 mmHg or >160 mmHg in patients aged 60-80 years with isolated systolic hypertension or diastolic >90 mmHg) remained unchanged: 46.8% +/- 1.1 45.7% +/- in 1999 and 2000 1.9. If the guidelines for diabetics (blood pressure < 130/85) are followed. 85.4% of diabetic patients were poorly controlled in 1999 and 86.6% in 2000. Similarly, in hypertensive patients with renal impairment (guideline recommendations: <125/75 mmHg), 94.5% in 1999 and 96.3% in 2000 were poorly controlled. Suggested lifestyle changes (reduced salt intake, weight loss, lower alcohol consumption, increased physical activity) were not followed well in either study: less than one in four patients fully implemented the desired changes in 1999 (23.7%) but only 24% in 2000. .5 of them did. Physicians specifically specified therapeutic agents in 68.0% of patients in 1999 and 67.6% in 2000, taking into account associated diseases. 2000. CONCLUSION: Comparison of the results of two surveys conducted in 1999 and 2000 on the treatment of patients with severe hypertension did not reveal any significant differences in blood pressure. d pressure control or treatment modalities. While not questioning the value of health funding interventions, these findings illustrate how difficult it is to change clinical practice within a short period of time, particularly in a disease that includes a number of different elements that include, inter alia, individual patient behavior. To significantly improve clinical management, it will likely be necessary to maintain dialogue between medical advisers of the medecins conseils and clinicians, and to renew campaigns aimed at helping patients be more responsible.",0,0,
1192,Severe sepsis management in patients admitted to Asian intensive care units: a prospective cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES To assess the compliance of Asian intensive care units and hospitals with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation and management packages. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of compliance on mortality and the organizational characteristics of hospitals associated with higher compliance. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SET 150 intensive care units in 16 Asian countries. PARTICIPANTS 1285 adult patients with severe sepsis were admitted to these intensive care units in July 2009. Organizational characteristics of participating centers, basic characteristics of patients, achievement of goals in resuscitation and management packs, and outcome data were recorded. KEY OUTCOME MEASURE Compliance with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation (six hours) and management (24 hours) packages. RESULTS Hospital mortality was 44.5% (572/1285). Compliance rates for resuscitation and management packages were 7.6% (98/1285) and 3.5% (45/1285), respectively. In logistic regression analysis, adherence to the following package goals independently predicted reductions in mortality: blood cultures (obtained on 803/1285""; 62.5%, 95% confidence interval 59.8% to 65.1%), broad-spectrum antibiotics (obtained on 821/1285) 63.9%, 61.3% to 66.5%, and central venous pressure (obtained at 345/870; 39.7%, 36.4% to 42.9%). High-income countries, university hospitals, intensive care units with an accredited fellowship program, and surgical intensive care units were more likely to comply with the resuscitation package. CONCLUSIONS While mortality from severe sepsis is high, compliance with resuscitation and treatment packages is generally poor in most of Asia. Because the centers included in this study may not be fully representative, reported success rates may overestimate the true degree of adherence to the recommended care and should be interpreted with caution. Blood cultures, antibiotics, and achievement of central venous pressure targets were independently associated with better survival.",0,1,

Methods: Literature on this topic published before November 2011 was identified using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsychINFO, AMED, and SCOPUS. Searches were limited to human studies published in English. This guide ranks evidence and recommendations based on the translation of the ACCF/AHA grading system to the ACP's clinical practice guidelines grading system. Recommendations: The guide includes 48 specific recommendations that address the following topics: patient education, management of proven risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, physical activity body weight and smoking), strategies to reduce unproven risk factors, medical therapy to prevent myocardial infarction and death and revascularization and patient follow-up to relieve symptoms, alternative therapy, improve survival and symptoms.",0,0,
1194,Managing the Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder in an Emergency,"INTRODUCTION: Patient agitation represents a significant challenge in the emergency room (ED), an environment in which medical personnel work under pressure dealing with a variety of medical emergencies. The potential to escalate into aggressive behavior that puts patients, staff, and others at risk makes it imperative to address agitated behavior quickly and efficiently. Time constraints and limited access to specialist psychiatric support have in the past led to a strategy of restraint and pacification ""which is believed to represent the most appropriate approach""; however, it is increasingly recognized that more patient-centered approaches yield better outcomes. The purpose of this review is to raise awareness of best practices for the management of agitation in the emergency department and to evaluate the role of new pharmacological interventions in this setting. DISCUSSION: Best Practices in the Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation (BETA) guidelines address the overall management of agitation, including triage, diagnosis, interpersonal calming skills, and medication choices. Since their publication in 2012, there have been further developments in pharmacological approaches to dealing with agitation, including both new agents and new modes of administration that increase the options available for both patients and physicians. Newer modes of administration that may be useful in rapidly managing agitation include inhaled, buccal/sublingual, and intranasal formulations. To date, inhaled loxapine is the only formulation administered non-intramuscularly with a specific indication for bipolar or schizophrenia-related agitation. While noninvasive formulations require collaboration from patients, they have the potential to improve the overall patient experience, thereby enhancing future collaboration between patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Agitation management in the emergency department should include a patient-centered approach, including non-pharmacological approaches, if possible. Where pharmacological intervention is required, a collaborative approach using non-invasive drugs should be used where possible.",0,0,
1195,Pain management in high-risk patients in a patient-centered medical home,"Chronic pain remains a major health problem despite significant advances in diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, and invasive and non-invasive interventions. The prevalence of chronic pain in the United States is staggering and continues to rise, and the personal and societal costs are not insignificant. The etiology of pain is complex, and individuals suffering from chronic pain tend to have significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and in some cases, substance use disorders. There is great concern about the increasing rate of prescription opioid abuse/abuse, both for non-medical use and in patients with pain receiving chronic opioid therapy. While there is an ongoing debate about the ""true"" incidence of opioid abuse in the pain population, patients suffering from both pain and substance use disorders are particularly compelling. Most patients with chronic pain, including co-occurring substance use disorders, are treated in primary care. Primary care workers do not have the time, resources and training to effectively evaluate, treat and monitor these complex cases. A range of evidence and expert consensus-based treatment guidelines have been developed on opioid therapy and risk reduction, but they are underutilized in both specialty and primary care clinics. This article will discuss the use of new technologies and delivery systems for risk stratification, intervention and monitoring of patients taking painful opioids.",0,0,
1196,Panic attack management in emergency patients,"Patients experiencing panic attacks often seek help in emergency rooms. However, it can be difficult to distinguish panic symptoms from some common medical emergencies. Also, many emergency medicine clinicians may not be equipped to effectively deal with panic attacks and related psychiatric conditions such as panic disorder and agoraphobia. Early misdiagnosis and inadequate management of panic attacks can have devastating long-term clinical and financial consequences. The purpose of this article is to provide information designed to increase the comfort and effectiveness of emergency physicians and associate professionals in coping with panic attacks. The authors provide guidelines for differential diagnosis, provide strategies for the management of acute panic and anxiety symptoms, and make recommendations for short-term postpanic clinical intervention.",0,0,
1197,Managing perceived conflicts of interest while enabling continuous innovation of medical technology,"Many of these advanced therapies used every day in vascular interventional surgery would not exist without the ongoing collaboration between vascular surgeons and the med technology industry. The flip side of this coin is that these vital relationships create multiple roles for surgeons and must be managed appropriately. The dynamic innovation process, along with factors such as improving product delivery techniques, training, testing and clinical trials, and product support, require continuous and close collaboration between surgeons and the device industry. This unique relationship sometimes leads to a perceived conflict of interest for physicians, in part because the competing pressures arising from multiple, overlapping roles such as clinician/caregiver/researcher/innovator/client are important. To address this issue, the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), the nation's largest medical technology association representing medical device and diagnostic companies, has developed a Code of Ethics to guide medical technology companies in their interactions with healthcare professionals. First introduced in 1993, the AdvaMed Code encourages both industry and physicians to commit to openness and high ethical standards in the conduct of their business interactions. The AdvaMed Code addresses the many types of interactions that can occur between companies and healthcare professionals, including training, consulting engagements, provision of demonstration and evaluation units, and charitable donations. By following the Code, Companies send a strong message that treatment decisions should always be made in the best interests of the patient.",0,0,
1198,Management of urinary incontinence in stroke rehabilitation -- a review,"OBJECTIVE: Post-stroke urinary incontinence is a common problem that affects future well-being and care for patients and their relatives. There are many therapeutic interventions available, but their effectiveness is not known in detail. The ongoing question for rehabilitation practice is how best to treat Urinary Incontinence (UI) in a way that does not endanger patients' daily lives. METHODS: The clinical trial search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, limited to German and English articles published between 1989 and April 2005. Medical, nursing, and physiotherapy interventions for the treatment of post-stroke UI were described and analyzed. RESULTS: Clinical trials were divided into process-oriented trials and trials looking at individual interventions. Process trials can be divided into three different groups with an overall success of 82-95%, 50-56% and 23-36%, respectively. Behavioral methods (caregiver-induced, patient-active, and other interventions) and medical interventions are available. The work of the most successful group includes staff training and the implementation of interventions based on an assessment procedure and a guideline. No clinical studies of individual interventions have come to the same conclusion as process-oriented studies. CONCLUSION: A multimodal approach is required to treat urinary incontinence: specific training of nurses, eg practice and acting in a problem-solving process such as the Rehabilitation Cycle, and providing care based on an assessment procedure and guidelines. It may be recommended to develop a guideline for the treatment of urinary incontinence after stroke. More research is needed on the effectiveness of individual interventions.",0,0,
1199,Marketing an investigational drug service,The customer survey was a useful tool for marketing the IDS. It provided guidelines for making decisions about the best use of limited human and material resources. Analyzing the results of the survey provided new priorities and directions for IDS. These results were then used with pharmacy financial and operational data to focus on areas of greatest importance to customers and the pharmacy. Physicians should not be reluctant to pursue compassionate use treatments because of the administrative program responsibilities that accompany such programs. Every patient should have the opportunity to benefit from alternative treatments under investigation. Nurses must be well-trained in order to maintain the quality of patient care and even increase it while studies are being carried out. Marketing research fulfilled its purpose of identifying service gaps and enabling us to improve our services.,0,0,
1200,Massachusetts General Physicians Organization's quality incentive program delivers encouraging results,"Doctors are increasingly becoming salaried employees of hospitals or large groups of doctors. However, few published reports have evaluated provider-oriented quality incentive programs for salaried physicians. In 2006, the Massachusetts General Physicians Organization launched a quality incentive program for salaried physicians. Eligible physicians were given performance targets for three quality measures every six months. Incentive payments can be as much as 2 percent of a doctor's annual income. Over the thirteen six-month period, the program used 130 different quality measures. While quality of care improvements and cost reductions are difficult to calculate, anecdotal evidence points to multiple successes. For example, the program helped doctors meet many federal health information technology meaningful use criteria and generated $15.5 million in incentive payments. The program also facilitated electronic health record adoption, improved hand hygiene compliance, increased efficiency in the radiology and cancer center, and reduced emergency room use. The program showed that even small incentives based on carefully structured criteria, prioritization, and open communication can help change salaried doctors' behavior in ways that improve the quality and safety of health care and alleviate doctors' sense of administrative burden.",0,1,
1201,MASTERPLAN: examining the role of nurse practitioners in a multifactorial intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Generally, nephrologists are primarily responsible for the care of CKD patients. However, in many cases the treatment goals as formulated in the guidelines are not achieved. Adding a nurse practitioner can improve the quality of care. The Multifactor Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal Patients Assisted by Nurse Practitioners (MASTERPLAN) study is a randomized controlled multicenter study aimed at investigating whether there is a multifactor approach to achieve treatment in patients with moderate to severe CKD (stages 3 and 4). Goals that use both a multidrug strategy and lifestyle therapy with or without the addition of a nurse practitioner will reduce cardiovascular risk and slow the decline of kidney function. Patients (n=793) were randomized to nurse care or physician care. In the nurse-care arm of the study, nurse practitioners use flowcharts to address risk factors that require medication and/or lifestyle changes. They are trained to coach patients through motivational interviewing to improve patients' self-management. At baseline, both treatment groups showed equal distributions for key variables in the study. Moreover, in only 1 patient, all of the risk factors were within the limits defined in various guidelines, emphasizing the relevance of our intervention.",0,0,
1202,Maternal dietary intake and physical activity habits in the postpartum period: associations with clinician advice in a sample of Australian first-time mothers.,"BACKGROUND: Numerous health benefits have been associated with achieving optimal dietary and physical activity behaviors during and after pregnancy. Understanding the predictors of these behaviors is an important public health concern, but little is known about the relationships between clinician advice and dietary and physical activity behaviors in postpartum women. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of dietary and physical activity recommendations given by clinicians during and after pregnancy and to evaluate whether this advice is related to postpartum diet and physical activity behaviors. METHODS: First-time mothers enrolled in the Melbourne InFANT Extend trial (n = 448) completed the Australian Cancer Council's Food Frequency Questionnaire three to four months after birth, which evaluated normal fruit and vegetable intake (serving/day). Total physical activity time for the previous week, time spent walking, and time spent in both moderate and vigorous activity (min/week) were assessed using the Active Australia Questionnaire. Advice received during and after pregnancy was assessed with separate questionnaire items asking whether a healthcare professional had discussed eating a healthy diet and being physically active. Linear and logistic regression evaluated the association of recommendations with dietary intake and physical activity. RESULTS: Overall, 8.6% of women met guidelines for combined fruit and vegetable intake. Overall, the mean total physical activity time was 350.9 +/- 281.1 min/week. Time spent walking (251.97 +/- 196.78 min/week), moderate (36.68 +/- 88.58 min/week) or vigorous activity (61.74 +/- 109.96 min/week) ) was more than time spent, and 63.2% of women meet physical activity recommendations. Most of the women reported that they received advice on healthy eating (87.1%) and physical activity (82.8%) during pregnancy. Fewer women reported receiving recommendations for healthy diet (47.5%) and physical activity (51.9%) three months after giving birth. There was no significant relationship between dietary and/or physical activity advice and maternal dietary intakes or physical activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendation for healthy eating and physical activity was received less after pregnancy than during pregnancy, but no association was observed between taking advice and behavior. More intensive approaches than advice may be required to encourage healthy eating and physical activity behaviors in new mothers.

1203,McMaster PLUS: a clustered randomized clinical trial of an intervention to accelerate the clinical use of evidence-based information from digital libraries,"Background: Doctors have trouble keeping up with new evidence from medical research. Methods: We developed the McMaster Premium LiteratUre Service (PLUS), an internet-based addition to an existing digital library, providing physicians with quality and relevance-grade medical literature appropriate to their clinical discipline. We evaluated PLUS in a clustered randomized trial of 203 participating physicians in Northern Ontario and compared the Full-Serve version (containing alerts for new articles and a cumulative database of alerts) to the Self-Service version (containing a passive guideline). evidence-based literature). Usage of the service was the primary trial endpoint. Results: Average number of library logins increased by 0.77 logins/month/user (95% CI 0.43, 1.11) in the Full Service group compared to the Self-Service group. The proportion of Full Service participants benefiting from the service in each month of the study period showed a sustained increase during the intervention period, with a relative increase of 57% (95% CI 12,123) compared to the Self-Service group. There was no difference in these rates at baseline, and following the transition of the Self-Service group to Full-Service, use of the Self-Service group became indistinguishable from that of the Full-Service group (relative difference 4.4 (95%) CI -23.7, 43.0). At the intervention and crossover periods, self-reported measures of usefulness did not differ between the 2 groups. Conclusion: A quality and relevance-rated online literature service increased the use of evidence-based resources. Information from a digital library by physicians.",0,1,
1204,Measures to assess practice change in medical practitioners,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing number of randomized studies and systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of interventions designed to bring about a change in clinical practice. The findings of this research are used to guide strategies to increase the uptake of evidence into clinical practice. Knowledge of the outcomes measured by these trials is vital not only for the interpretation and application of work to date, but also for informing future research in this expanding field of study and helping to collate results in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. . METHODS: The purpose of this review was to identify methods used to measure change in the clinical practice of healthcare professionals following an intervention aimed at increasing the application of evidence. All published studies (n = 228) included in a recent, comprehensive Health Technology Assessment of interventions to implement clinical practice guidelines and change clinical practice formed the sample for this study. Using a standard data extraction form, a reviewer (SH) extracted relevant information from the methods and/or results sections of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of behavior change by health practitioners are the most common, with 88.8% of studies being used as an outcome measure. Measures assessing patient-level change, true change measures, or surrogate change measures were used in 28.8% and (respectively) 36.7% of studies. The knowledge and attitudes of health practitioners were evaluated in 22.8% of the studies and organizational changes in 17.6%. CONCLUSION: Most intervention trials aimed at changing clinical practice have measured the impact of the intervention at the practitioner level, ie did the practitioner change what they do or have their knowledge and/or attitudes about this practice changed? Less than a third of the trials measured resulted in a change in the final endpoint of the patient's health status, with or without any change in practice.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of mentoring as a KT intervention designed to increase the use of evidence by healthcare professionals in clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using electronic databases (ie, MEDLINE, CINAHL), gray literature, and manual search. Appropriate studies have evaluated the consultation of healthcare professionals responsible for patient care to increase the application of the evidence. Mentoring, (a) a more experienced mentor than the mentee""; (b) individualized support based on the mentee's needs;"" and (c) to be involved in a specified interpersonal relationship of mutual benefit, commitment and commitment. Two reviewers independently screened citations for relevance, extracted data, and quality of evaluated studies. The data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2012, 10 studies were eligible from 10,669 citations. Mentoring as a KT intervention has been evaluated in Canada, the USA and Australia. Exposure to mentoring improved some behavioral outcomes compared to no mentoring (one study). Compared with controls or other multi-pronged interventions, multifaceted interventions involving mentoring improved practitioners' knowledge (four out of five studies), beliefs (four out of six studies), and impact on institutional outcomes (three out of four studies). There was mixed evidence for changes in professionals' behavior and its impact on practitioners' and patients' outcomes: some outcomes improved while others showed no difference. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Only one study evaluated the effectiveness of mentoring alone as a PT intervention and showed improvement in some behavioral outcomes. Nine other studies evaluating the effectiveness of mentoring as part of a multifaceted intervention showed mixed findings, making it difficult to determine the additive effect of mentoring. More research is needed to identify effective mentoring as a KT intervention.",0,0,
1209,Measuring the effects of reminders for outpatient flu vaccines at the clinical point of opportunity,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of computer-based reminders about the flu vaccine at each clinical opportunity on the behavior of individual clinicians. DESIGN: The authors conducted a four-year prospective study of clinicians' flu vaccine behavior. About half of clinicians in an internal medicine clinic used a computer-based patient record system (CPR users) that created computer-based reminders. Other clinicians used traditional paper records (PR users). MEASUREMENTS: Each non-acute visit of a patient eligible for influenza vaccination was considered an opportunity for intervention. Patients with vaccine contraindications were excluded from the study. Guideline compliance was defined as documents showing that a clinician ordered the vaccine, advised the patient about the vaccine, recommended it to a patient who refused the vaccine, or confirmed that the patient had received the vaccine elsewhere. The authors calculated the proportion of opportunities where each clinician documented action in CPR and PR user groups. RESULTS: CPR and PR user groups had different baseline compliance rates (40.1 and 27.9 percent, respectively)"";"" P<0.05). Both rates remained stable over an initial two-year period (P = 0.34 and P = 0.47), respectively. While compliance rates in the CPR user group increased by 78 percent from baseline (P<0.001), the rates for the PR user group did not change significantly (P = 0.18). RESULTS: Clinicians administering CPR with reminders had higher rates of documentation of compliance with influenza vaccination guidelines than those using paper records.

1211,Medical care of type 2 diabetes in the light of international and national recommendations: a retrospective analysis.,"STUDY FIELD QUESTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2Dm) is a chronic disease with great economic impact. In 2009, the Swiss Society of Endocrinology and Diabetes (SSED) published recommendations for the treatment of T2Dm. There is currently very little data on metabolic control and physician compliance with treatment guidelines in Switzerland. We aimed to explore clinical care in T2Dm in the year following the publication of the SSED recommendations. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the charts of all patients with T2Dm who applied to our general internal medicine clinic in 2009. Metabolic control was assessed from glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Antidiabetic therapy was analyzed and screening frequencies for end-organ damage were investigated. A group with newly diagnosed T2Dm was analyzed separately from patients with known T2Dm at presentation. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) HbA1c level in patients known to have T2Dm was 7.66% +/- 1.73%. Only 44% of patients showed HbA1c levels within the target of 8.5%, with the proportion of those treated with insulin increasing from 49% at admission to 76% at discharge. Only half of the patients received a lifestyle intervention in the year prior to hospitalization or during their hospital stay. Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy screening were performed in approximately one-third and two-thirds of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the unselected T2Dm patients admitted to our hospital had inadequate metabolic control. Implementation of treatment recommendations by both general practitioners and hospitals should be improved.",0,0,
1212,Medical communication and technology: a video-based process study on the use of decision aids in primary care consultations.,"BACKGROUND: Most research on decision-making in healthcare has focused on consultation outcomes. Less is known about the process by which clinicians and patients arrive at treatment decisions. This study aimed to quantitatively describe the behavior displayed by physicians and patients during primary care consultations when three types of decision aids were used to promote treatment decision making in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A video-based study in an activity trial comparing the use of paper-based guidelines (control) with two types of computer-based decision aids (implicit and explicit versions of DATS II). The treatment decision was related to warfarin anti-coagulation to reduce the risk of stroke in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Twenty-nine interviews were videotaped. A ten-minute consultation 'section' was sampled for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocols for verbal behavior and ethological techniques for nonverbal behavior. RESULTS: Median consultation times (quartiles) varied significantly depending on the technology used. Paper-based guides took 21 (19-26) minutes to run, 31 (16-41) minutes for the covered tool, and 44 (39-55) minutes for the open tool. At the decision point, GPs dominated speech accounting for 64% (58-66%) of all statements, and this trend was similar across all three arms of the study. Providing information for both GPs and patients was the most frequent activity for GPs and patients. , however, GPs did so at twice the rate of patients and at higher rates in consultations involving computerized decision aids. The language of the GPs was highly technical and only 7% of their speech was socio-emotional in content,"" which was half the socio-emotional content (15%) that patients showed. showed that both parties were actively involved in the conversation in these consultations. However, even in consultations aimed at promoting collaborative decision-making, GPs were verbally dominant and primarily acted as providers of information for patients. Additionally, computer-based decision aids, especially in the later stages, These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more 'sharing' in treatment decision making and may take too long to negotiate for routine primary care use in their current form.",0,0,

Getting acquainted with semiotics, the doctrine of signs, can complete this project. A sign represents something. We communicate indirectly through signs, and by interpreting what the signs mean, we make sense of our world and diagnose and understand our patients.

1222,"Combining regulatory, pharmaceutical industry, and US payer perspectives on improving approaches to heterogeneity of treatment effect in research and practice","Effective monitoring and management of the science of heterogeneity of treatment effect (IIT) relies on mutual understanding and collaboration of the perspectives of various stakeholders in healthcare. In this article, we compare, contrast and try to find areas of alignment between the perspectives of three such stakeholders, namely regulators, the biopharmaceutical and device industry, and US payers. First, we discuss how evidence of IIT is produced and can be improved. For drugs, much of the initial research is conducted by the pharmaceutical industry, driven by basic science but also constrained by potential markets, regulatory approval requirements, trial size considerations, and expectations of those paying for proof of value. When a drug is marketed, more evidence can be produced by combining trial data, conducting meta-analysis, and analyzing real-world results through observational research designs""; we explore how these efforts can benefit from collaboration between these stakeholders. Second, we discuss the equally important use of IIT evidence so that physicians and patients can access and benefit from information from this research. Research findings should be translated into actionable information and guidelines that can be incorporated into daily practice. Doing so requires interaction and collaboration among everyone involved, based on facilitated communication as well as further evaluation research. We present examples of various cross-industry initiatives underway in this area. Finally, we explore some of the economic aspects of IIT research as part of the drug development, marketing, and treatment process. Understanding the economic incentives available is essential to align these incentives to improve the availability and use of IIT evidence. Clear understandings of high-value goals, ways to efficiently generate and communicate information, and value propositions among regulators, pharmaceuticals, and payers can lead to ""win-win"" scenarios for patients, individual payers, the overall healthcare system, and the future. drug development in the production of new drugs.",0,0,

This review aims to describe the current state of the medical literature on this subject. METHODS: A narrative review of the current medical literature, including randomized clinical trials and clinical guidelines addressing the health benefits of physical fitness and regular exercise in middle-aged and postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing and preventing obesity and related comorbidities (hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and heart disease) is one of the important benefits of exercise. However, prolonged physical exercise is also associated with cancer, dementia and cognitive decline, negative mood and anxiety symptoms, and reduced rates of osteoporosis, osteopenia, falls and fractures. Beneficial physical activity includes exercise to improve cardiovascular fitness (aerobics), muscle strength (resistance), flexibility (stretching), and balance (many of the former and additional activities such as yoga). CONCLUSIONS: Given that it is clearly beneficial, inexpensive and with minimal risk, maintaining a healthy exercise regimen should be the goal of every participant to improve lifelong well-being.

METHODS: It included a pragmatic iterative design, a literature review and focus groups, followed by a formative assessment that included reflection, questionnaires, and interviews. General practices and relevant community mental health teams in southeast London were included. Participants included community mental health workers, psychiatrists, practice nurses, general practitioners, administrators, and local specialists with an interest in primary care mental health services. RESULTS: The shared maintenance model includes key components of enhanced communication with the development of a registry and database with review and recall systems. Local needs assessment, audit, training and guidelines are complementary components. The Mental Health Link response is a streamlined quality improvement program that aims to accelerate the development of services by bringing teams together to agree on a shared care model appropriate to local needs, skills and interests, and by supporting the development of practice. systems. CONCLUSIONS: A model for shared care should take into account the interdependencies of the components as well as the relationship to the context.

Meta-analysis of changes in weight (slopes) and meta-regression over time shows a change of about 0.1 BMI units per month from 3 to 12 months of active programs and a recovery of about 0.02 to 0.03 BMI units per month during the following. maintenance stages. Different analyzes suggested that calorie recommendations, frequency of support meetings, inclusion of exercise, and diabetes may be independent predictors of weight change. Limitations: Interventions, study samples, and weight changes were heterogeneous. Studies generally had moderate to poor methodological quality. They had a high rate of missing data and could not explain these losses. Meta-analytical techniques could not fully explain these limitations. Conclusions: Compared with usual care, dietary counseling interventions produce modest weight losses that diminish over time. Future studies should focus on minimizing losses, monitoring and determining which factors result in more effective weight loss.",0,0,

This study is a systematic review of the scientific literature on successful treatment in general, as well as specific aspects of methadone substitution therapy considered by the guidelines of the German Medical Association. The literature has been updated to January 2004. Older randomized controlled trials and more recent quasi-experimental studies suggest methadone maintenance therapy to reduce illicit drug use, improve health status of drug users, reduce criminal behavior, and promote rehabilitation of opiate-dependent individuals. Evaluation of international studies clearly shows that beyond the diagnosis of opiate addiction, criteria for accessing substitution treatment, for example the presence of a life-threatening comorbidity, are not a prerequisite for substitution in other countries and are therefore not discussed internationally. literature.

As new tools and technologies emerge, clinicians and researchers are faced with an increasing array of options, both for clinical assessment through digital capture of key behavioral elements of a condition, and for intervention through formalized treatments, coaching, and other technology-assisted interventions. patient communication tools. Yet, as with any new toolkit for the assessment or treatment of a medical condition, establishing and adhering to reporting guidelines – that is, what works and under what circumstances – is an essential component of the translation research process. Here, we review the methodological strengths and weaknesses of existing studies of smartphones and wearables for schizophrenia, using the recently published World Health Organization mHealth Assessment, Reporting and Evaluation guidelines to evaluate mobile health applications. While growing evidence supports the feasibility of using mobile devices in severe mental illness, most studies to date have not adequately reported on accessibility, interoperability, costs, scalability, reproducibility, data security, usability testing, or compliance with national guidelines or regulatory regulations.

Three general strategies have emerged in the literature to treat cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs have received much attention, but their procognitive effects tend to be modest. Augmentation strategies originating from basic science or translation research have often been promising in small uncontrolled trials"";"" however, few agents have been successful in rigorously designed trials.

Improving primary care physicians' compliance with mammography screening guidelines,"Recent studies have documented that physicians' adherence to recommended periodic health screening increases by reminding physicians. However, these reminders are often costly to maintain and replace. This study investigates the effect of a microcomputer tickling system on the sequencing of mammograms. All women aged 40 years and older (N = 1262) who visited the outpatient clinic within a 6-month period were randomly assigned to one of two groups. For the experimental group, the date of the last mammogram ordered and recorded in the clinical database was written on the interview form created for each patient visit. No information about previous mammograms was printed for patients in the control group. Women in the experimental group were more likely to be requested for mammography during the study period (19% vs. 12%, P = .001) and, as a result, were more likely to follow mammography guidelines when the study was completed.

Improving the compliance of primary care physicians with mammography screening guidelines.,"A study was conducted to investigate the effect of microcomputer-generated ""reminders"" that prompt doctors to schedule periodic mammographic scans for patients. The main reasons clinicians do not perform health screening tests such as mammograms include forgetfulness, lack of time, discomfort, and patient discomfort or rejection. The doctor's refusal to recommend a mammogram is usually due to the doctor's supervision during the patient visit. This study shows that a microcomputerized reminder system can be used to increase physicians' compliance with preventive health screening recommendations.

DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal observational study. ENVIRONMENT: Medical-surgical intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS: Multidisciplinary clinicians caring for critically ill patients in a 15-bed closed medical-surgical intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Stage 1 was an initial period of 3 months during which we documented anticoagulation and mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Phase 2 was a 1-year period in which we implemented a thromboprophylaxis guideline using a) ""interactive multidisciplinary training services""; b) verbal reminders to the ICU team; c) computerized daily nurse thromboprophylaxis record; d) using weekly chart feedback on adherence to the guideline to individual intensive care specialists. ;"" and e) publicly displayed graphical feedback on group performance. Stage 3 was a 3-month follow-up period, during which we documented thromboprophylaxis 10 months later. In this period, the computerized daily nurse record of thromboprophylaxis was continued. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Although patients in stage 2 had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment II scores than patients in stages 1 and 3, ICU and hospital mortality rates were similar between stages. Rate (median % [interquartile range]) ICU patient-days heparin thromboprophylaxis in phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were 60.0 (0, 100), 90.9 (50, 100), and 100.0 (60, 100) (p= .01).

1234,Misprescribing of controlled substances: Evaluation of a professional development program,"BACKGROUND: Controlled prescription drug (CPD) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Most physicians who participate in a 3-day continuing medical education (CME) professional development program (PDP) lack training in identifying risk and managing patients who abuse CPDs. To address this issue, the authors evaluated a PDP that trains physicians to prescribe correctly, identify substance abuse, utilize screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT), and practice motivational interviewing (MI). METHODS: The authors conducted a program evaluation to evaluate the efficacy and impact of PDP on physicians' knowledge and prescribing behavior. RESULTS: Participants (N = 174) were typically middle-aged (mean age 53 years), male (89%), physicians (82%), and other healthcare professionals (18%). Many doctors work alone in primary health care (46%). Course assessments were completed by n = 155 (89%) participants who rated the course and presenters highly (mean 4.8/5, respectively). Physicians' knowledge scores at pre/post assessments increased significantly: pretest (Mean = 58.7, SD = 13.12) and posttest (Mean = 78.28, SD = 9.83) (t(173) = 20.06, P </= .0001 , 95% confidence interval, CI: [-21.51, -17.65]). Almost half of the respondents, n = 83/174 (48%), completed the follow-up questionnaire and 93% agreed/strongly agreed (A/SA) that they had made professional practice changes. Most respondents working with an active DEA registration (n = 57) agreed/strongly agreed that they implemented changes to align their practices with current guidelines (89%), used CPD more appropriately (87%), set up office prescribing (81%), identifying and referral to more drug addicts (80%), sharing new knowledge/experiences from the course with 25 other healthcare professionals (93%), and felt that the course positively impacted their behavior personally and professionally (90% and 96%). CONCLUSION: This is the first known study to evaluate a PDP in this population. Results showed participant satisfaction and improvement in prescriber knowledge and self-reported prescribing behaviors. However, more studies are needed to assess actual clinical practice changes, the direct impact on patient outcomes, and recidivism rates.",0,0,
1235,Reducing Prenatal Zika Virus Infection in the Americas,"Background: Because of the risk of Zika virus infection in the United States and the links between infection and microcephaly, other serious neurological conditions and fetal death, health departments in the region have advised women to delay pregnancy. However, the effectiveness of this policy in reducing prenatal Zika virus infection has yet to be measured. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of pregnancy delay policies on the incidence and prevalence of prenatal Zika virus infection. Design: Vector-borne Zika virus transmission model consistent with epidemiological data from 2015 to 2016 on Zika virus infection in Colombia. Setting: Colombia, August 2015 - July 2017. Patients: Colombian population classified by sex, age, and pregnancy status. Intervention: Recommendations to delay pregnancy by 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 months at different levels of compliance. Measurements: Weekly and cumulative incidence of prenatal infections and cases of microcephaly. Conclusions: With 50% adherence to recommendations to delay pregnancy for 9 to 24 months, the cumulative incidence of prenatal Zika virus infections is likely to decrease by 17% to 44%, while recommendations to delay pregnancy for 6 or less months are likely to increase. prenatal infections in 2% to 7%. This paradoxical exacerbation of prenatal Zika virus exposure is due to an increased risk of pregnancies shifting towards the peak of the epidemic. Limitation: Due to limited data, sexual transmission was not explicitly accounted for in the model, but was implicitly included in the overall transmission rate calibrated by observed incidence. Conclusion: Pregnancy delays can have a significant impact on reducing the incidence of microcephaly, but there is a risk of exacerbating the Zika virus epidemic if the duration is not sufficient. Latency, population cohesion, and timing of initiation of intervention should be carefully considered. Primary Funding Source: National Institutes of Health.",0,0,

1237,Mobile Web application for self-management of low back pain: randomized controlled trial,"Background: Non-specific low back pain (NLBP) is a diagnosis for individuals with back pain without an underlying medical cause (eg, tumor, infection, fracture, herniated disc, spinal stenosis). The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Pain Society (APS) recommend multidisciplinary treatments for NLBP lasting longer than 4 weeks. However, this approach is impractical for many physicians, and relatively few providers offer NLBP therapy that meets common ACP-APS guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile Web intervention called ""FitBack"" to help users implement tailored strategies to manage and prevent NLBP events. METHODS: A total of 597 adults were recruited, screened, consented, and evaluated online at baseline, month 2 (T2), and month 4 (T3). After baseline assessments, participants were randomly divided into three groups: the FitBack intervention, the alternative care group, which received 8 emails encouraging participants to connect to six Internet resources for NLBP, and the control group. The FitBack group also received weekly email reminder prompts and emails to do reviews for 8 weeks. The control group was contacted only for evaluation. RESULTS: Users of the FitBack program showed greater improvement over the control group in each comparison of critical physical, behavioral, and worksite outcome measures at 4 months follow-up. Additionally, FitBack program users outperformed the alternative care group in current back pain, behavioral, and worksite outcomes at 4-month follow-up. For example, subjects in the control group were 1.7 times more likely to report current back pain than subjects in the FitBack group; subjects in the alternative care group were 1.6 times more likely to report current back pain at 4-month follow-up. Also, FitBack program users, patient activation, Planned A theory-based independent mobile Web intervention that tailors content to users' preferences and interests could be an effective tool in the self-management of low back pain. From a RE-AIM perspective (i.e. access, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, relevance of practice, and maintenance), this study supports the notion that there is significant value in this type of intervention as a potentially cost-effective tool for people. supported by caregivers The results are promising, considering that it is neither integrated into a health promotion campaign, which may have provided additional support for participants.

1238,Modeling eye gaze patterns in clinician-patient interaction with delayed sequential analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether delayed sequential analysis could be used to describe eye gaze orientation between clinicians and patients in the medical interview. This is particularly important as new technologies are applied to multi-user healthcare environments where trust is critical and nonverbal cues are an integral part of achieving trust. This method of analysis can lead to design guidelines for technologies and more effective evaluations of interventions. BACKGROUND: Nonverbal communication patterns are important aspects of clinician-patient interactions and can affect patient outcomes. METHODS: The eye gaze behaviors of clinicians and patients across 110 video-recorded medical encounters were analyzed using the delayed sequential method to identify important behavioral sequences. Latency ordinal analysis included both event-based latency and time-based latency. RESULTS: Results from the event-based delay analysis showed that the patient's gaze followed the clinician's gaze, but not the clinician's gaze. Time-based sequential analysis showed that patient responses usually occurred within 2 seconds of the clinician's initial behavior. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the clinician's outlook significantly influences the medical encounter, but the reverse is not true. APPLICATION: Findings from this research have implications for the design and modeling interactions of clinical trial systems. Similar research methods can be used to identify different behavioral patterns in clinical settings (physical layout, technology, etc.) to facilitate and evaluate clinical trial system designs.",0,0,

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interpersonal counseling compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in primary care settings with major depression and to identify moderators of treatment outcome. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial at nine centers (DEPICS, Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registration Number: ACTRN12608000479303). The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode (defined as the 2-month Hamilton Depression Rating Scale </=7). Daily functioning was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify moderators of treatment outcome. RESULTS: The percentage of patients achieving remission at 2 months was significantly higher in the interpersonal counseling group compared to the SSRI group (58.7% vs. 45.1%, P = 0.021). Five moderators of treatment outcome were found: severity of depression, functional impairment, anxiety comorbidity, previous depressive episodes, and smoking habit. RESULTS: We identified some patient characteristics that predicted a different outcome with pharmacological and psychological interventions. If our results are confirmed in future studies, these features will help clinicians define criteria for the first-line treatment of depression for patients' characteristics.",0,0,

However, even well-structured guidelines have little effect unless supported by dissemination and implementation strategies. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of 'educational access' as a strategy to facilitate the acquisition of dyspepsia management guidelines in primary care. STUDY DESIGN: A pragmatic, clustered randomized controlled trial of directory entry compares educational access to mail-guide diffusion alone. SETTING: One hundred and fourteen general practices (233 GPs) in the Salford and Trafford Health authority catchment area in the northwest of England. METHOD: In July 1997, all applications were guided by mail. Intervention group practices began receiving educational access three months later. This consisted of practice-based seminars with hospital professionals where guideline recommendations were evaluated and implementation plans were formulated. The seminars were followed by 'reinforcement' visits 12 weeks later. Outcome measures were: (a) “relevance of referral” and (b) open-access upper gastrointestinal endoscopy findings; (c) costs of physician prescriptions for acid-suppressing drugs; and (d) laboratory-based use Serological testing for Helicobacter pylori Seven days before and/or after intervention. data were collected and analyzed for therapeutic purposes over the course of one month.

1241,Altering the prescribing behavior of angiotensin receptor blockers by selectively revoking administrative pre-authorization requirements for losartan.,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether revoking the pre-authorization (PA) requirement (managerial pre-approval) for losartan in a healthcare organization (HMO) could reduce prescribing of more expensive angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). METHODS HMO physicians were informed that losartan would no longer require PA and appropriate changes were made to the electronic prescribing computer program. Monthly distribution of ARB prescriptions for new patients by drug was calculated from data obtained from electronic records before and after policy change. The proportion of patients (percentage and 95% CI) treated with losartan who met the criteria for treatment with ARBs (hypertension or heart failure in patients who developed adverse effects in response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or macroproteinuria) The canceled PA requirement was calculated. RESULTS The total number of PA requests for ARBs rose again to 651 in January 2010, down 48.6% from 961 in December 2008, the month before the policy change, to 494 the following January. increased from 15 to 16 (6.7% increase) for losartan (114% increase), from 15 to 16 (6.7% increase) for candesartan, and from 89 to 71 (20.2% decrease) for valsartan. The duration of action was about 1 year for reduced ARB demands for more expensive drugs. Only 23.3% (95% confidence interval 18.1-28.4) of patients receiving losartan met the criteria for receiving ARB. CONCLUSIONS Removing the PA requirement for this drug alone was an effective time-limited strategy to reduce prescribing of relatively expensive drugs.",0,1,
1242,Modular ICT-based patient empowerment framework for diabetes self-management: Design perspectives and validation results.,"INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that more than 382 million people worldwide, most of whom are between the ages of 40 and 59, have diabetes. ICT can play a key role in better management of diabetes and patient empowerment. Patient empowerment largely engages patients in their healthcare processes, and disease management becomes an integral part of their daily lives. Self-management opens the possibility for patients to contribute to their own healthcare and gain more control over their illness. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of an ICT-based patient empowerment framework in diabetes self-management. METHODS: A modular patient empowerment framework supporting diabetes self-management was designed and implemented. The framework combines expert knowledge in the form of clinical guidelines and supports patients in identifying personalized activities based on medical advice and personal goals, and in collecting observations of daily life. The usability and usefulness of the proposed framework was evaluated in a pilot study involving 60 patients and 12 healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that a patient empowerment approach based on self-management ICT tools was beneficial and accepted by both patients and physicians. For patients already disciplined in disease management, the piloted solution acted as a facilitator for data logging. For the rest, it served as an incentive for better adherence to disease management principles. ICT tools have encouraged many patients to be more physically active and make adjustments to their dietary habits. However, this effect proved to be tightly correlated with the subjects' sociocultural background. The study also showed that even in patient-centered self-management interventions, doctors still have a key role to play. However, acceptance of such interventions by healthcare professionals depends not only on the level of impact on their patients' disease management, but also on the level of impact on their workflow. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that a patient empowerment approach based on self-management ICT tools is beneficial and accepted by patients and physicians. Moreover, there are clear indications that ICT frameworks such as those presented in this paper can support patients in behavioral changes and better disease management. Finally, it was realized that self-management solutions should be built around the goal of not only educating and guiding patients in disease self-management, but also helping them explore the field of decision and providing insights and explanations about their implications. own values in the decision.",0,0,
1243,"Molecular sources of residual cardiovascular risk, clinical signals and innovative solutions: association with subclinical disease, inadequate treatment and poor compliance: implications of new evidence on optimizing cardiovascular patient outcomes.","Residual risk The continued risk of significant major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid targets remains a concern among cardiologists. Contributing factors to this ongoing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and other risk factors, inherent characteristics of statin drugs and patient characteristics, i.e. atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including genetics and behaviour. Providers, health systems, society, public policies and the environment also play a role. Large statin studies show an average 28% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of approximately 69%. Incomplete reductions in risk and failure to ameliorate risky conditions can result in continued progression of atherosclerosis with new and recurrent lesions, remodeling, arrhythmias, readmissions, invasive procedures, and terminal disability at the original and distant culprit sites. As a result, the identification of additional agents to reduce residual risk, especially when co-administered with statin drugs, has been an ongoing search. The current model of atherosclerosis includes many steps by which the disease can progress independently of guideline defined elevations in LDL cholesterol. Differences in genetic response to statin therapy, differences in the ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair, and differences in susceptibility to non-lipid risk factors such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes may all pose residual risks. Numerous inflammatory and metabolic processes may also provide ultimate therapeutic targets for reducing residual risk. Classically, epidemiological and other evidence suggested that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. Low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely correlated with MCVE when LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to targets. The flow capacity, or ability to remove cholesterol from macrophages, is believed to be the main antiatherogenic mechanism responsible for the reduction in MCVE, in part mediated by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiplatelet and vasodilator properties, including protection of LDL from oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has a major influence on endothelial function. Also, HDL supports endothelial repair and progenitor cell health and promotes nitric oxide production. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disease may fail to protect and may even become proinflammatory or pro-oxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL cholesterol is not beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, combined with extensive preclinical information about the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the ""HDL hypothesis"", that is, raising HDL cholesterol by itself will reduce MCVE. After the suspected AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study and withdrawal of two major cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target side effects and the other for deficiency. efficacy, improvement continues for two other agents, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which significantly lower LDL cholesterol. The negative but controversial trial of HPS2-THRIVE (Heart Protection Study 2-HDL Therapy to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by empirical evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic effects of HDL. Non-HDL cholesterol reflects cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B and outperformed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. Besides including a measure of residual risk, the advantages of using non-HDL cholesterol as the primary lipid target are now convincing. A reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, hypertension, and diabetes will help reduce residual risk. Although much improved, control of risk factors other than LDL cholesterol still remains inadequate due to deficiencies in compliance with guidelines and poor patient compliance. More efficient and greater use of proven simple therapies such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers in conjunction with statin therapy may be more efficient in improving outcomes than using other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multimechanical, global and national programs using primitive, primary and secondary prevention are required to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk level.",0,0,

1247,Motivation is a crucial factor for adherence to a healthy lifestyle in people with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.,"OBJECTIVE: To test the Adaptation Theory of People with Chronic Disease in terms of adherence to treatment in patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND: More information on the concept of compliance is needed for the development of nursing interventions and nursing guidelines for patients with coronary heart disease. DESIGN: A cross-sectional, multicenter study. METHODS: This study was conducted between February and December 2013 with 416 patients with coronary heart disease 4 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. A self-reported questionnaire was used to assess their adherence to treatment. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The theory explained 45% of adherence to a healthy lifestyle and 7% of adherence to medication. Structural equation modeling confirmed that motivation and care outcomes had the highest association with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Responsibility was associated with drug compliance. Support from relatives, support from nurses and doctors, and motivation, cooperation, fear of complications, and sense of normalcy were associated with adjustment. CONCLUSION: Patients who were motivated to self-care and thought that the outcomes of care were important were more likely to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Responsible patients were more likely to adhere to their medication. It is important to consider these elements as part of secondary prevention strategies in patients with coronary heart disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.",0,0,
1248,Motivational Enhancement Therapy with and Without Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for the Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,"Background: Although psychological problems may hinder diabetes care, the effectiveness of psychological treatments in improving diabetes outcomes is unclear. Objective: To determine whether motivational reinforcement therapy with or without cognitive behavioral therapy improves glycemic control in type 1 diabetes compared to usual care. Design: Randomized, controlled trial . Setting: 8 diabetes centers in London and Manchester, UK. Patients: 344 adult diseases with type 1 diabetes for more than 2 years, hemoglobin A1c levels between 8.2% and 15% and no complications or serious comorbidities. Intervention: Motivational reinforcement therapy (4 sessions over 2 months), motivation enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavioral therapy (12 sessions over 6 months) or usual care. Measures: 12-month change in hemoglobin A1c levels (primary outcome), hypoglycemic events, depression, quality of life, fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes self-care activities, and body mass index x (secondary results). Results: In an analysis of all randomly assigned patients, the 12-month change in hemoglobin A1c levels compared with normal care was 0.46% (95% CI, 0.81% to 0.11%) on motivational boosting therapy plus plus. 0.19% (CI, 0.53% to 0.16%) in the cognitive behavioral therapy group and the motivational reinforcement therapy group alone. There was no evidence of treatment effects on secondary outcomes. Limitations: Of the 1659 patients screened, only 507 were eligible and 344 participated. Data on primary outcome were not available for 11.3% of participants. The study design did not allow for the additive effect of cognitive behavioral therapy plus motivational enhancement therapy to be distinguished from the effect of the more intense and duration of the combined intervention compared to motivational enhancement therapy alone. Conclusion: Nurse-administered motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavior therapy adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes It is suitable for Combined therapy provides a modest 12-month improvement in hemoglobin A1c compared with normal care, but not motivational enhancement therapy alone.",0,0,

1251,Mouthwash in oral mucositis in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation: a qualitative study.,"Background: Oral mucositis is a common side effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and may lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and higher costs. It also has an impact on patients' quality of life. In the stem cell transplant ward of a Swiss university hospital, patients are trained according to current mouthwash guidelines and their oral condition is evaluated daily. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do patients experience oral mucositis and what factors affect their regular mouth rinse behavior? METHODS: In this qualitative part of the simultaneous mixed methods research, 14 patients were interviewed using an interview guide. The data were analyzed using content analysis methods. RESULTS: The results showed that oral mucositis cannot be considered separately from disease, isolation, and care. Mucositis was only a heavy burden for patients with a serious occurrence. Other symptoms were more significant for patients with lower grade formations. The research identified motivating and debilitating factors for regular mouth rinsing, one of the most important preventive procedures. CONCLUSION: This study highlights how important it is to see oral mucositis in the context of transplantation and that knowing the motivating and inhibiting factors can help nurses in patient care. Improving patient self-management is an important consideration.",0,0,
1252,"So Much Cheaper, Nearly Good: Cost-Effective Medical Innovation","Under conditions of scarce resources, cost-saving innovations can improve overall outcomes by allowing more efficient reallocation of resources, even if they are somewhat less effective than current options. The authors systematically reviewed all cost-benefit analyzes cited by MEDLINE from 2002 to 2007 to identify and identify medical innovations that reduce cost and quality. At least $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year lost. Of the 2128 cost-effectiveness ratios of 887 publications, only 9 (0.4% of the total) identified 8 innovations that were considered incremental cost-effectiveness. Examples include percutaneous coronary intervention (instead of coronary artery bypass grafting) for multi-vessel coronary disease, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (instead of electroconvulsive therapy) for drug-resistant major depression, watchful waiting for inguinal hernias, and hemodialyzer sterilization and reuse. On a per-patient basis, these innovations saved $122 to almost $12,000, but resulted in losses of 0.001 to 0.021 quality-adjusted life years (about 8 hours to 1 week). These findings demonstrate that increasingly low-cost innovations are rare in the medical literature.",0,0,
1253,Multidimensional analyzes to evaluate the relationships between physicians' treatment options and patient characteristics: an example of COPD,"BACKGROUND: In some cases, practice guidelines do not provide robust evidence-based guidance on COPD treatment options, especially when large studies fail to identify subgroups of those who respond particularly well or poorly to existing medications. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study explored the throughput of four types of multidimensional analyzes to assess associations between clinical characteristics of COPD patients and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments prescribed by lung specialists in a real-life context. RESULTS: A total of 2494 patients were recruited by 515 respiratory physicians. Multiple relevance analysis and hierarchical clustering identified 6 clinical subtypes and 6 treatment subgroups. Strong bidirectional associations were found between clinical subtypes and treatment subgroups in multivariate logistic regression. However, clinical subtypes were not associated with specific prescribing profiles, although the overall frequency of prescriptions for all pharmacological treatment types varied from one clinical subtype to another. Using the canonical analysis of redundancy, the rate of variation in pharmacological treatments explained by clinical features remained modest: 6.23%. This proportion was greater for the non-pharmacological components of care (14.29%). CONCLUSION: This study shows that although pharmacological treatments of COPD are quantitatively very well correlated with the clinical characteristics of patients, there is no specific patient profile that can be qualitatively associated with prescriptions. This underlines the uncertainties perceived by physicians to distinguish the relevant effects of current pharmacological treatments. The methodology applied here is useful for identifying areas of uncertainty that require further research and/or guidance clarification.",0,0,
1254,Multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric obesity: nutritional assessment and management,"Evaluation and treatment methods for pediatric obesity are developing rapidly. Obesity, thought to result from an imbalance of caloric intake and expenditure, requires a comprehensive assessment of patient, familial, environmental, genetic, and cultural characteristics in order for clinicians to design successful interventions. Quantitative nutritional assessment of calorie intake is difficult and time consuming and should only be used in isolated settings such as a research setting or if initial approaches to management have failed. Alternatively, providers should identify dietary patterns or behaviors that are linked to obesity and are promising targets for change. Clinicians should tailor interventions taking into account patient and family motivation and readiness for change. Current guidelines recommend gradual increases in treatment plans, and multidisciplinary treatment teams are recommended for patients requiring intensive intervention. Providers at the multidisciplinary level should combine their area of expertise with that of the team to develop a comprehensive management plan. This article reviews current recommendations for the assessment and treatment of pediatric obesity with a focus on nutritional assessment as part of a multidisciplinary team.",0,0,
1255,Multifactorial effects and deviations on the safety and quality of drug administration in an acute medical/surgical context,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although many factors influence drug management, our understanding of the interaction of these factors on drug quality and safety is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate multifactorial effects on drug quality and safety in the context of a single control policy for drug administration in acute care. APPROACH: An exploratory/descriptive study using non-participant observation and follow-up interview was used to identify factors affecting drug quality and safety during drug administration episodes (n=30). Observations focused on nurses' interactions with patients during drug administration and the characteristics of the environment in which they took place. During the short semi-structured interviews with the participating nurses, the observed data were validated upon completion of the observation period. RESULTS: The findings showed that nurses developed therapeutic relationships with patients in terms of evaluating patients before administering drugs and educating patients about drugs during drug administration. Nurses experienced more frequent distraction when drugs were stored and prepared in a common medicine room according to the ward design. Nurses deviated from best practice guidelines during drug administration. APPLICATIONS: Nurses' skills and readiness to develop therapeutic relationships with patients have increased drug quality and safety, thus protecting patients from potential adverse events. Deviations from best-practice drug practice had the potential to reduce drug safety. System factors such as service design that determine drug storage areas can be easily addressed to minimize potential error. CONCLUSION: Nurses exhibited behaviors that increase the quality and safety of drug administration"";"" however, it was observed that the implementation standards were violated. These findings will inform future intervention studies to improve drug quality and safety.",0,0,
1256,Multifactorial intervention with nurse practitioners does not alter cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Strict implementation of multi-target guidelines reduces vascular risk in diabetic patients. It is unclear whether this also applies to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To assess this, the MASTERPLAN Study randomized 788 patients with CKD (estimated GFR 20-70 ml/min) to receive additional intensive nurse practitioner support (intervention group) or nephrologist care (control group). The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. At a mean follow-up of 4.62 years, moderate but significant reductions were found in the intervention group compared with controls in blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, anemia, proteinuria, and increased use of active vitamin D or analogues, aspirin, and statins. No differences were found in rates of smoking cessation, weight loss, sodium excretion, physical activity, or glycemic control. Intensive control did not reduce the composite endpoint rate (21.3/1000 person-years in the intervention group, 23.8/1000 person-years in the controls (hazard ratio 0.90)). No differences were found in secondary outcomes of vascular interventions, all-cause mortality, or end-stage renal disease. Thus, the addition of intensive support by nurse practitioner care in patients with CKD improved some risk factor levels but did not significantly reduce the proportion of primary or secondary endpoints.",0,0,
1257,Multi-level support for physical activity and healthy eating,"OBJECTIVE: This article reports a study evaluating the relationship between social and community-level supports and physical activity and dietary behaviors in a low-income Latino population with multiple chronic conditions. BACKGROUND: With less physical activity and documented nutritional deficiencies than whites, Latinos in the United States represent a disproportionate share of the population with chronic diseases. This pattern of health inequality is seen in countries where there is a struggle to improve the health status of low-income, immigrant and indigenous communities. Social-ecological theories of health behavior emphasize the importance of considering social and community support for health behavior and provide a useful framework for considering ways to improve physical activity and nutrition for migrant and indigenous groups. METHOD: Here we report data from a baseline assessment of 200 patients from a health clinic serving a low-income, primarily Hispanic population in the United States. Participants enrolled in Resources for Health, a randomized controlled trial to promote multi-level support for chronic disease self-management. Measures included demographic data as well as multi-level support for self-reported physical activity, dietary behavior, and chronic disease management. The baseline data reported here were collected between February 2002 and September 2003. RESULTS: Use of multi-level supports (eg, family, individual, and healthcare provider) was statistically significantly associated with meeting physical activity guidelines and better eating behaviors. Being female and having multiple chronic conditions were also associated with better eating behavior. These variables explained 20% of the variance in dietary behavior. CONCLUSION: The results support a social-ecological approach to promoting healthy behavior in this low-income, primarily Latino sample with multiple chronic conditions. Addressing multiple levels of support for healthy behavior is important in interventions to improve physical activity and diet, and nurses may be in a particularly good position to address such issues for low-income, indigenous and immigrant patients with chronic conditions.",0,0,

METHODS: The pharmacy identified patients currently on antipsychotic therapy at William R Sharpe Jr Hospital. All patients who received >/=2 scheduled antipsychotic drugs at the same time were included in the study. Data on demographics, current drug combinations used, history of therapeutic regimens attempted, and prescriber rationale were prospectively evaluated over a 60-day period beginning 13 December 2000 and ending 10 February 2001. The prescriber's rationale for using .1 concurrent antipsychotics and other drug treatment regimens tried were compared with chart papers and published therapeutic guidelines for schizophrenia. RESULTS: During a 60-day surveillance period, 206 patients received scheduled antipsychotic drugs and 85 (41%) received at least 2 agents. Respondents to a prescriber survey (59%) indicated augmentation was the most common rationale for combination therapy"";"" the least likely logic was cross-titration. Survey responses also demonstrated a belief that more than half of patients treated with combinations of multiple antipsychotics had questionable therapeutic benefit. In addition, chart papers showed that most of these patients did not receive an adequate trial of monotherapy with other atypical or typical agents or clozapine prior to the combination antipsychotic regimen. Fifty-one percent of medical records did not document the rationale for concomitant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of published data, the practice of using multiple antipsychotic agents is considered a gray area that requires the prescriber to have a high level of awareness in assessing efficacy and safety. Documentation of the cause, adverse events, and response to the treatment regimen is essential in providing optimal patient care.",0,0,
1259,Multi-screen electronic alerts to enhance venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is often not used adequately in high-risk patients. Previously, we designed a single-screen computer alert program that identifies hospitalized patients at high risk for VTE who do not receive prophylaxis and advise their physicians to prescribe prophylaxis. While this strategy reduced the 90-day incidence of symptomatic VTE by 41%, most electronic warnings were ignored. We have now developed a series of three-screen alert computer programs designed to train physicians who initially refuse to seek prophylaxis after a single screen alert. Out of a total cohort of 880 patients, physicians responsible for 425 patients received a single electronic alert, while 455 who refused prophylaxis after the first screen received the second and third screens of the new three-screen alert. Our enhanced serial three-screen alert program generated VTE prophylaxis orders for 58.4% of 455 patients whose doctors initially refused to order prophylaxis after a single screen alert. There was no significant difference in symptomatic 90-day VTE rates between the two groups (2.8% for one screen and 2.2% for three screens, p=0.55). We conclude that our three-screen computer warning program can significantly improve prophylaxis among physicians who reject the first single-screen warning.",0,1,
1260,Should diabetes be a deadly disease in Africa? Examination of treatment costs,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the costs of diagnosing and treating diabetes in Tanzania. DESIGN Costs were estimated from the reported and recorded experience of patients with new diabetes in 1989-90 and diabetic patients first seen in 1981-2. AYAR Muhimbili Medical Center, Dar es Salaam. SUBJECTS 464 patients (315 men and 149 women). 262 patients were diagnosed between September 1, 1989 and August 31, 1990 (group 1), and 202 patients were diagnosed between June 1, 1981 and August 31, 1982 (group 2). RESULTS The average annual direct cost of diabetes care in 1989-90 was $287 for a patient requiring insulin and $103 for a patient not requiring insulin. Purchasing insulin accounted for 68.2% ($156) of average annual outpatient costs for patients requiring insulin. For patients not requiring insulin, the cost of oral hypoglycemic drugs and the treatment of chronic complications and infections accounted for 42.5% ($29.3) and 48.8% ($33.7) of the costs, respectively. The cost of outpatient treatment of diabetic patients for the whole of Tanzania was estimated at $2.7 million, *75,128 (32.2%) of which were for insulin. The costs of doctors and nurses accounted for 0.2% of the total costs of outpatient services. Annual direct inpatient care costs were estimated at $1.25 million. About 0.2% of the Tanzanian population aged 15 and over used the equivalent of 8% of total government health expenditure of $47,4088,382. CONCLUSION Diabetes places serious pressure on the limited resources of developing countries. If African diabetic patients have to pay for their treatment, many will be unable to do so and die.",0,0,
1261,nationwide survey of alcohol screening and brief intervention practices at US Level I trauma centers,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Committee implemented the requirement that Level I trauma centers have a mechanism for identifying problem drinking patients and the capacity to provide interventions for patients who screen positive. Although landmark alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) mandate were expected to impact trauma practice nationwide, a literature review revealed no studies that systematically documented the pre-ACS requirement for SBI practice. STUDY DESIGN: Trauma programs at all Level I trauma centers in the USA were contacted and asked to complete a questionnaire about pre-ACS requirement trauma center SBI administration. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight (73%) of 204 Level I trauma centers responded to the survey. More than 70% of responding centers routinely used laboratory tests (eg, blood alcohol concentration) to screen patients for alcohol, and 39% routinely used a screening question or standard screening tool. Screen-positive patients received a formal alcohol consultation or had an informal alcohol discussion with staff about 25% of the time. RESULTS: The trial observed significant variability between Level I centers in the percentage of patients screened and the nature and extent of intervention in screening-positive patients. Following the ACS Trauma Committee requirement, future research can systematically implement and evaluate training in the delivery of evidence-based alcohol interventions and trauma center institutional capacity building for continued delivery of SBI.",0,0,
1262,Natural treatment for earache in children,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis media is one of the most common diseases of early infancy and childhood and one of the most common reasons for children to consult a doctor. In the last 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in the diagnosis of otitis media worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM) by age 7 years. Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or complain of distinctive behaviors that parents interpret as indicating earache. Treating ear pain early in the course of AOM reduces both parental anxiety and child discomfort and speeds up the healing process. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naturopathic and conventional therapy in the treatment of otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. METHODS: The study was designed as a double-blind study in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children aged 5-18 years with ear pain and clinical findings due to middle ear infection were analyzed. Children were randomly assigned to be treated with Naturopathic Herbal Extract Ear Drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops with or without amoxicillin. At enrollment, children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (content: allium sativum, verbascum thapsus, calendula flores, hypericum perfoliatum, vitamin E in lavender and olive oil), alone, 5 drops 3 times daily (group A), or with a topical anesthetic together (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerine) 5 drops 3 times a day (group B) or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/day (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses, both NHEDs 5 drops 3 times daily (group C) or 5 drops of topical anesthetic 3 times a day (group D). A double-blind design was used and all ear drops were placed in the same bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (MS) evaluated and treated all patients included in the study and recorded all data. Presence or absence of ear pain was evaluated by visual analog scale for 3 days. Ear pain was assessed with a specially designed observation tool based on previous reports. One side of the instrument consisted of a linear numbered scale from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) and a corresponding color scale ranging from blue to deep red. The reverse included 5 scales of facial expression ranging from a broad smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst possible pain) and a corresponding color scale from blue to deep red. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of patient age or gender, fever grade, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and acute otitis media severity or laterality. Each group showed a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over 3 days. Patients given ear drops alone responded better than patients given ear drops in combination with amoxicillin. Outcomes were better in the NHED group than in the controls. However, the findings showed that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limited and could be explained simply with the passage of time. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for earache in the absence of systemic infection or serious underlying disease. Since there is no evidence that systemic antibiotics alone improve treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not alter the natural course of otitis media, the main goal of treatment should be to alleviate ear pain, as in this study. Alternative, naturopathic herbal extract remedies may offer many new possibilities in the treatment of AOM-related ear pain. Primary care physicians should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried 1 or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before seeking consultation. As widely reported in the medical literature, this herb, these plant extracts have the potential to meet all the requirements of suitable drugs that can be used routinely in pediatric patients, namely in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity, immunostimulation against common pathogens. ability, antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well absorbed, penetrating well into the tissue surrounding the eardrum. They have been found to increase local immunological activity. Finally, plant extracts are well tolerated (due to long elimination times), easy to administer, and less expensive than new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. Based on our findings that the group with the most significant therapeutic effects (NHED with topical anesthetic) explained only 7.3% of total pain reduction, we suggest that sometimes the GP or pediatrician should give the human body a chance to repair. itself. However, if the physician believes there is an indication for treatment, a local treatment similar to the one used in our study may be sufficient, especially if the parents are concerned. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a herbal extract solution may be beneficial in cases of earache caused by AOM in children where a simple waiting period of 2 to 3 days as well as active treatment is required. Concomitant antibiotic therapy does not seem to contribute.",0,0,

1265,Neonatal end-of-life decision making: Physicians' attitudes and relationship to self-reported practices in 10 European countries,"Context The ethical issues surrounding the end-of-life decision-making process for infants with an adverse prognosis are controversial. There is little empirical evidence about the attitudes and values underlying such decisions in different countries and cultures. Purpose To investigate the variability of neonatal physicians' attitudes among 10 European countries and the relationship between such attitudes and their practice of self-reported end-of-life decisions. Design and Adjustment Research was conducted in 10 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania) in 1996-1997. Participants A total of 1391 physicians (response rate, 89%) work regularly in 142 neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Main Outcome Measures Scores on an attitude scale measuring opinions about the absolute value of life (0 points) and the value of quality of life (10 points)"";"" Self-report on setting limits on intensive neonatal interventions in cases of poor neurological prognosis. Results Physicians more likely to agree with statements consistent with protecting life at all costs were from Hungary (mean attitude scores, 5.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.9-5.5]), Estonia (4.9 [95% CI, 4.3-5.5]), Lithuania (5.5 [95% CI, 4.8-6.1]), and Italy (5.7 [95% CI, 5.3-6.0]) They are more likely to agree that quality should be taken into account. from the United Kingdom (attitude scores, 7.4 [95% CI, 7.1-7.7]), the Netherlands (7.3 [95% CI, 7.1-7.5]), and Sweden. ten (6.8 [95% CI, 6.4-7.3]). .

1266,Neurobehavioral morbidity associated with sleep-disordered breathing in children: a comprehensive review.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review research on the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDD) and neurobehavioral functioning in childhood. DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative literature review. SETTING: None. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The findings of 61 studies on the relationship between childhood SDB and neurobehavioral functioning were critically evaluated and synthesized. There is strong evidence that childhood SDB is associated with deficits in behavior and emotion regulation, scholastic performance, sustained attention, selective attention, and alertness. There is also evidence that USB has minimal association with a child's typical mood, expressive language skills, visual perception, and working memory. The findings were insufficient to draw conclusions about some aspects of intelligence, memory, and executive functioning. The mechanisms by which SDB may lead to neurobehavioral morbidity are under investigation, but clinical symptoms such as chronic snoring remain the best predictors of morbidity. Short-term USB therapy outcome studies are encouraging, but long-term outcomes are unknown. Failure to treat SDB seems to put children at risk for long-term neurobehavioral deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood SDB is associated with neurobehavioral morbidity. Even in the absence of a much-needed randomized clinical trial, there is strong evidence of association, consistent findings, and effect specificity when widely used guidelines for causal inference are applied. There is significant evidence that this association fits the expected temporal pattern and that SDB is a biologically plausible cause of neurobehavioral deficits. Clinicians should be alert for the coexistence of SDB symptoms and concerns about the child's academic progress, attention, arousal, or behavior or emotion regulation.",0,0,

DESIGN Population-based case-control study. AYAR Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital Research Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neonatal screening cards consisting of 443 white case patients with cerebral palsy and 883 white controls were tested for viral nucleic acids from enteroviruses and herpes viruses using the polymerase chain reaction. Herpes group A viruses included herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) and herpes group B viruses. included varicella zoster virus (VZV) and human herpes viruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7). RESULTS The prevalence of viral nucleic acids was high in the control population: 39.8% of controls tested positive and the prevalence was highest in premature infants. Detection of herpes group B viral nucleic acids increased the risk of developing cerebral palsy (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.59).

1268,Never too old? Age should not be a barrier to enroll in cancer clinical trials,"Across Europe and the USA, more than 60% of the total cancer incidence occurs in the elderly (> or =65 years old) population; this is a group of patients that needs special consideration when making treatment decisions due to a number of factors. Despite this, elderly patients are often underrepresented in clinical trials, so study data should be interpreted with caution, as outcomes in younger cancer patients may not always predict the typical elderly cancer patient. Reports indicate that elderly cancer patients represent approximately 22% of patients participating in phase II clinical trials. Barriers to accruing older patients to clinical trials include the lack of appropriate trials, the high burden of comorbidities, study-imposed limitations, and physician attitudes. There is a belief that elderly patients may not be able to tolerate various cancer treatments and may result in this patient population being excluded from prospective trials. However, clinical data suggest that age alone is not a sufficient reason to discontinue treatment. The lack of clinical trial data, and the associated lack of evidence-based guidelines for elderly patients, means that doctors have little to guide them, and as a result, patients may not receive optimal treatment. Because clinical trials are the primary method of assessing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant and palliative cancer therapies, trials specifically targeting the elderly cancer patient are necessary to adequately assess the risks and benefits of therapy in this vulnerable population. This review aims to assess clinical reality and clinical trial age mismatch to evaluate outcomes for older cancer patients and determine how this may be addressed. Possible reasons for the difference and the resulting clinical consequences are also taken into account.",0,0,

1271,New drugs in anesthesia: can we afford them?,"The most important challenge facing doctors today is the dilemma of providing high-quality care in a financially responsible manner. The cost can no longer be ignored. Pharmacoeconomics is an essential component of medical education. Economic considerations should be an integral part of drug development and clinical trials. Although anesthetists are concerned that the use of cheaper drugs may compromise patient outcomes and satisfaction, there is little evidence to support such concerns. This is a fertile area for future intensive research. Pharmacoeconomics is dynamic. The cost of drugs is not static, patterns of drug use are changing rapidly, and clinical practice is in constant flux. The answer to cost containment is not simply to cut, limit, delist, or simply hope for the best, but rather to manage and change the application as it adapts to changing needs. Educational programs, guidelines, departmental policies, system changes, and financial incentives can be implemented to ensure consistent and enduring adherence to the principles of pharmacoeconomics and value-based care. Some argue that national societies should establish guidelines for cost-beneficial practices. Others support physician autonomy in drug selection. Changing physician behavior is difficult. This change will happen gradually and will be the subject of many emotionally charged philosophical discussions. There will be great reluctance from patients to reject pharmacologically superior drugs solely on the basis of cost, especially since drugs are such a small fraction of the total cost. We must be careful not to make a penny of wisdom and nonsense. Drug acquisition costs are only one element in a large and complex equation. Focusing on the cost of acquiring medicine can be dangerous, or even naive if we fall into the trap of knowing the cost of everything and not the value of anything.",0,0,

1275,NHMRC guidelines for clinical practice for ASD and PTSD,"Dear Editor, I recently described the case of a scuba instructor suffering from acute stress disorder (ASD), a type of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following the death of one of his students. The treatment described was a combination of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exposure-based exercises. As it happened, in August the Australian Center for Post Traumatic Mental Health published Australian clinical practice guidelines for ASD and PTSD. These have been approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The treatment described in the diver injury case complies with these guidelines. NHMRC guidelines suggest that the most helpful response immediately after a traumatic event (for example, diver death or serious injury) is to offer psychological first aid. This includes providing information about traumatic stress responses, promoting self-care, and using available social support. It is recommended that the medical practitioner monitor the patient, monitor for improvement, plateau, or deterioration, and be prepared to offer assistance or appropriate referral if necessary. Guidelines recommend the use of trauma-focused psychological therapy as a first-line intervention for ASD and PTSD. EMDR, including in vivo exposure, and CBT are considered the most effective treatments. If medication is required, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are considered the best option. For the benefit and convenience of patients and practitioners, the NHMRC guidelines and a comprehensive set of information guides on ASD and PTSD can be downloaded online as a pdf file from http://www.acpmh.unimelb.edu.au. An update in the Medical Journal of Australia provides traumatic stress information for medical professionals, including screening questions that can be used to identify patients suffering from ASD and PTSD.

1279,Unaffected by the active dissemination of the Ottawa Ankle Rules: further evidence of the need for local enforcement of enforcement guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Local enforcement strategies are often required to ensure consistent adherence to clinical guidelines, but they are time consuming and expensive. The authors tested an educational intervention designed to increase the use of the Ottawa Ankle Guidelines, a widely publicized set of clinical guidelines previously shown to reduce the use of radiography for diagnosing acute ankle injuries. METHODS: The study consisted of a quasi-experimental, before and after comparative analysis. Trained experts provided 1-hour training sessions to healthcare professionals from 63 Ontario hospitals and provided resource materials on the Ottawa Ankle Rules. Participants were asked to evaluate the intervention. The authors then compared the use of ankle radiography for the periods before and after training sessions for adults with acute ankle injuries in 10 hospitals who received the educational intervention and reported no prior (n = 5) or some (n = 5) use. and already in 5 control hospitals that refused educational intervention because they were following the rules. RESULTS: Although participants gave highly favorable evaluations of the Ottawa Ankle Rules and training sessions, there was no reduction in ankle radiography use for the 10 hospitals that received the training sessions (73% before intervention and 78% after intervention, p = 0.11). In contrast, use of radiography was significantly reduced from 75% to 65% in the 5 control hospitals (p = 0.022). COMMENT: Even if a dissemination strategy is well received and includes widely accepted clinical guidelines, the impact on behavior in clinical practice may be small. In addition to wide dissemination, an active local practice strategy is required to encourage physicians to adopt clinical guidelines.",0,0,

Despite its implications for youth with severe mental disorders, little has been published about this increasingly common medical comorbidity in the psychiatric literature. The objectives of this article are: 1) to provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NAFLD, including progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); 2) to describe two clinical cases that illustrate challenges in management; and 3) to provide screening recommendations, differential diagnosis, and approaches to monitoring and intervention. METHODS: A literature review including guidelines and recommendations, case reports, and control liver histology biopsy photographs was conducted.CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD during childhood and adolescence as a precursor to NASH progresses to fibrosis in a small percentage of young people, increasing the risk of early-onset cirrhosis and The cases presented suggest that youth with serious mental health disorders who are already at greater risk for obesity and its sequelae may be at higher risk for progression to NASH due to higher rates of weight gain in addition to potentially overweight or obese status. plus your worry and changes in liver metabolism from psychotropic drugs that promote fat accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rapid weight gain into the overweight or obese categories or who develop elevated liver transaminases that persist for 3-6 months should be screened or referred for screening by psychotropic provider clinicians for early detection, diagnosis, and association. Treatment by a pediatric gastroenterologist to reduce the risk of progression to NASH, which is reversible if early and adequate lifestyle change results in significant weight loss.

1281,Noninvasive imaging predicts failure burden of spine with simulated osteolytic defects,"BACKGROUND: Clinical treatment of lytic tumors of the spine is currently based on geometric measurements of defect. However, the mechanical behavior of a structure depends on both its material and its geometric properties. Quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry were explored as noninvasive tools to quantify the material and geometric properties of vertebrae with a simulated lytic defect. From these measurements, yield loads were estimated using composite beam theory. METHODS: Thirty-four fresh frozen cadaver spines were divided into functional spinal units of three vertebral bodies with two intervertebral discs at the thoracic and lumbar levels. Lytic defects of equal size were created in one of three locations: the anterior, lateral, or posterior region of the vertebra. Each spinal unit was scanned using computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and axial and bending stiffnesses were calculated from the image data. Each specimen was brought to the breaking point under combined compression and forward bending, and the axial load and bending moment at the yield point were recorded. RESULTS: Although the relative defect size was nearly constant, the measured yield loads had a wide distribution, suggesting that defect size alone is a poor predictor of failure. However, the structural stiffness measurements derived from the image correlated moderately well with the measured yield loads. Also, using composite beam theory with stiffnesses derived from quantitative computed tomography, vertebral yield loads were estimated on a one-to-one basis (fit, r(c) = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: We show that although current clinical guidelines for estimating fracture risk are based on geometric measurements of the defect, the relative size of the defect alone does not account for variation in vertebral yield loads. However, composite beam theory analysis with stiffness measurements derived from quantitative computed tomography can be used to prospectively predict yield loads of lytically defective vertebrae. CLINICAL APPLICABILITY: Image-estimated vertebral yield loads and analytical models that approximate the loads applied to the spine during activities of daily living can be used to calculate a fracture risk factor that can be used by physicians to plan appropriate treatment or intervention.",0,0,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of acupuncture, back schools, psychological treatments, exercise therapy, functional restoration, interdisciplinary therapy, massage, physical therapies (interventional therapy, low-level) laser therapy, lumbar supports, short wave diathermy, surface heat, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasonography), spinal manipulation, and yoga for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain). DATA SOURCES: English studies were identified through MEDLINE (until November 2006) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by manual searches of expert-recommended reference lists and additional citations. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews and randomized trials of 1 or more previous treatments for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain) pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, job disability, or patient satisfaction. DATA DRAWING: We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. We used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Review Group criteria for individual trials to rate methodological quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found good evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation were all moderately effective. chronic or subacute (lasting >4 weeks) low back pain. Benefits relative to placebo, sham therapy, or no treatment were an average of 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analog pain scale, 2 to 4 points on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, or a standard mean difference of 0.5 to 0.8. We found reasonable evidence that acupuncture, massage, yoga (Viniyoga), and functional restoration are also effective for chronic low back pain. For acute low back pain (duration <4 weeks), the only non-pharmacological treatments with evidence of efficacy are superficial heat (good evidence for moderate benefits) and spinal manipulation (moderate evidence for small to moderate benefits). Although serious harms appear to be rare, data on harms are underreported. There are no studies addressing the optimal sequencing of treatments, and methods for tailoring treatment to individual patients are still in the early stages of development. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sciatica treatments. LIMITATIONS: Our primary data source was systematic reviews. We included non-English trials only if they were included in English systematic reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Therapies with good evidence of moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute low back pain are cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation. . For acute low back pain, the only treatment with good evidence of efficacy is superficial heat.",0,0,
1284,Non-pharmacological management of hypertension: results of interviews with 100 GPs.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the type and level of non-pharmacological management offered by general practitioners for essential hypertension. DESIGN: An interviewer-directed open-ended questionnaire using a standard case of a 60-year-old man with essential hypertension. Seventy interviews were conducted face-to-face and 30 interviews were conducted by telephone. SETTING: Auckland general applications. SUBJECTS: A random sample of 100 Auckland general practitioners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aspects of patients' medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and treatment related to non-pharmacological management. RESULTS: There was a response rate of 84%. Most GPs reported recommending non-pharmacological treatment at the initial consultation before prescribing medication. However, few offered detailed programs. Dietary therapy, restriction of alcohol consumption, and exercise were recommended by most general practitioners. Restriction of sodium intake and behavioral therapy were less popular among non-pharmacological interventions. The median number of patients' visits to the GP before medications were prescribed was five, in accordance with guidelines. The median number of days from the first visit to the prescription of drug therapy was 42 (range 2-341). The clinical advice given by the majority of the participants was in line with current guidelines on the treatment of hypertension, but the recommendations given were broad in scope. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that general practitioners are aware of non-pharmacological interventions for the treatment of hypertension. They reported routine use of non-pharmacological treatments early in the clinical process before considering pharmacological treatment for blood pressure lowering and other health benefits. These non-pharmacological treatments are not offered in well-defined and detailed programmes.",0,0,

The group has so far conducted 12 clinical trials involving more than 2,500 patients ranging from minor phase II to large randomized phase III trials. At the time of this writing, two randomized trials are underway (comparing two doses of iv pamidronate and melphalan-prednisone (MP) versus MP-thalidomide in elderly patients). The group strived for a simple organization with multiple responsibilities delegated to regional coordinators (Denmark 3, Norway 5, Sweden 5). Regarding research design, the group felt it was important that studies were based on sound scientific questions, were simple to address for participants, and included population-based, investigator-initiated, quality of life and health resources assessment as endpoints. It can be used as the basis for various scientific side projects. Like other clinical trial groups, the NMSG faces a number of challenges in the years to come. The financial situation for independent investigator-initiated research is far from satisfactory, especially with regard to the resource-consuming implementation of stricter good clinical practice rules and ethics committee requests. The NMSG has also faced increasing difficulties in recruiting patients into recent research, partly due to problems with participating physicians (lack of support, troublesome paperwork, insufficient credit for participation).

1289,Nudge antibiotic prescription in line with guideline: a randomized clinical trial,"IMPORTANCE: ""Nudges"" that influence decision making through subtle cognitive mechanisms have been shown to be highly effective in a wide variety of applications, but little experimentation has been done to improve clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of a behavioral ""nudge"" based on the principle of public commitment to promote the judicious use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial in 5 outpatient primary care clinics. A total of 954 adults visited ARI during the study period: 449 patients were treated by clinicians selected at random to the letter of commitment (335 at baseline, 114 during intervention period); 505 patients were treated by clinicians randomized to standard practice control (384 baseline, 121 INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of the display of poster-size commitment letters in the examination rooms for 12 weeks. These letters, which included clinician photographs and signatures, expressed their commitment to avoid inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. MAIN RESULTS AND PRECAUTIONS: Antibiotics during baseline and intervention periods -antibiotic prescribing rates for inappropriate ARI diagnoses adjusted for patient age, gender, and insurance status RESULTS: Baseline rates were 43.5% and 42.8% for control and poster, respectively. During the intervention period, rates of inappropriate prescribing for controls increased to 52.7% , send a letter of commitment It decreased to 33.7% in the condition that it was removed.

There was no evidence of diagnostic coding change, and rates of appropriate antibiotic prescription did not decline over time. RESULTS AND SUITABILITY: Display of poster-size commitment letters in examination rooms reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs.

1290,Nudge physician prescription decisions by segmenting the order set: results of a sketch-based study.,"Background Health professionals are rapidly adopting electronic health records (EHRs). Within EHRs, seemingly innocuous menu design configurations can influence provider decisions for better or for worse. Purpose The aim of this study was to examine whether grouping of menu items systematically influences prescribing practices among primary care providers. Participants We surveyed 166 primary care providers in a research network in the Greater Chicago area, of which 84 responded (51% response rate). Responders and non-responders were similar across all observable dimensions, except that participants were more likely to work in an academic setting. The Design Questionnaire consisted of seven clinical histories. Each sketch described the typical signs and symptoms for acute respiratory infections, and providers selected treatments from a menu of options. For each sketch, providers are randomly assigned to one of the two menu sections. For non-antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, the treatment menu grouped prescriptions together while listing over-the-counter (OTC) drugs one by one or showing the reverse section. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, the treatment menu either listed narrow-spectrum antibiotics individually while grouping broad-spectrum antibiotics, or showed the reverse section. Key Precautions The main outcome was the provider's treatment choice. For short stories that were not appropriate for antibiotics, we categorized the responses as prescription drugs or over-the-counter options only. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, we classified the responses as broad- or narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Key Results Among the short stories, there was an 11.5 percentage point reduction in choosing aggressive treatment options (eg, broad-spectrum antibiotics) when aggressive options were grouped compared to when the same options were listed separately (95% CI: 2.9 to 20.1%). ; "" p?=?.008). Results Provider treatment choice appears to be influenced by grouping of menu options, suggesting that the arrangement of EHR order sets is not an arbitrary practice. Careful creation of EHR order sets can serve as an important opportunity to improve patient care without limiting physicians' ability to prescribe what they believe is best for their patients.",1,1,
1291,To act prudently? The effect of reminders on antibiotic prescriptions.,"Antibiotic resistance is a major and growing global health threat with significant consequences. The prudent use of antibiotics is vital to delay the spread of resistance. In this study, I use a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of reminders to primary care patients on antibiotic use. The intervention was implemented in 31 clinics during flu season in Stockholm. A two-level randomization was used, with clinical-level and individual-patient-level randomization. With reminders, antibiotic use decreased by 12.6 percent compared to control clinics. The impact is clinical, suggesting that doctors or doctor-patient interactions are affected, not individual patients. Results from a follow-up experiment also show that an effect on the interactions between doctor and patient is the primary driver of the main results. Behavioral interventions targeting these interactions have the potential to reduce antibiotic use. However, more research is needed as monitoring and adherence may also play a role.",0,1,
1292,Nurse-led home self-help therapy for primary care patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of pragmatic home rehabilitation—an increasing activity program designed collaboratively by patient and therapist—and a non-directive counseling-based supportive listening approach for primary care inpatients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgia. encephalomyelitis or encephalitis (CFS/ME). DESIGN Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. DETERMINATION 186 general practice in the north-west of England between February 2005 and May 2007. PARTICIPANTS 296 patients aged 18 years and older with CFS/ME (mean disease duration of seven years) were diagnosed using the Oxford criteria. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized as usual to pragmatic rehabilitation, supportive listening, or GP therapy. Both therapies were administered at home in 10 sessions over 18 weeks by one of three adult private general nurses who received four months of training, including supervised practice in each of the interventions. As usual, GP treatment was not restricted, except that patients were not referred to systematic psychological therapies during treatment. Main outcome measures Primary clinical outcomes were fatigue and physical functioning at the end of treatment (20 weeks) and 70 weeks after recruitment compared to usual GP therapy. Lower fatigue scores and higher physical functioning scores mean better results. RESULTS A total of 257 (87%) of the 296 patients enrolled in the study were evaluated at the primary endpoint at 70 weeks. Analysis was on a treatment basis, with robust treatment effects estimated after adjusting for missing data using probability weights. Immediately after treatment (at 20 weeks), fatigue was significantly improved in patients (n=95) allocated to pragmatic rehabilitation (effect estimation -1.18, 95% confidence interval -2.18 to -0.18""; P=0.021) but physical functioning (-0.18%, %). There was no statistically significant difference in fatigue or physicality at one year (70 weeks) after the end of treatment when compared to patients who opted out for treatment normally (n=100) 95 CI -5.88 to +5.52; P=0.950). functionality among patients treated as usual (-1.00, 95% CI -2.10 to +0.11; P=0.076 and +2.57, 95% CI 3.90 to +9.03; P=0.435). 101) had worse physical functioning than those who opted out of treatment as usual (-7.54, 95% CI -12.76 to -2.33; “P=0.005) and there was no difference in fatigue. At 70 weeks, patients allocated to supportive listening were not significantly different from those allocated to treatment-as-usual in both primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For patients with CFS/ME in primary care, pragmatic rehabilitation delivered by trained nurse therapists improves fatigue in the short term compared to unconstrained GP therapy as usual, but the effect is small and not statistically significant at one year follow-up. Supportive listening by trained nurse therapists is not an effective treatment for CFS/ME. Trial registration International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number IRCTN74156610.",0,0,
1293,Nurse practitioners improve quality of care in chronic kidney disease: two-year results of a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Here, we evaluate whether strict implementation of multi-target guidelines with the help of nurse practitioners (NP) improves management in patients with CKD. METHODS: MASTER PLAN was a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in nine Dutch hospitals. Patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20-70 ml/min) were randomized to receive NP support (intervention group (IG)) or physician care (control group (CG)). The patients were followed for a median of five years. The data presented is an interim analysis of risk factor control at two-year follow-up. RESULTS: 788 patients (532 M, 256 F), (393 CG, 395 IG), mean (+/-SD ) age 59 (+/-13) years, eGFR 38 (+/-15) ml/min were included . /1.73m(2), blood pressure (BP) 138 (+/-21)/80 (+/-11) mmHg. At two years, 698 patients (352 IG, 346 CG) could be analyzed. Compared with CG, IG had lower systolic (133 vs 135 mmHg""; p= 0.04) and diastolic BP (77 vs 80 mmHg; p=0.007), LDL cholesterol (2.30 vs 2.45 mmol(-1); "" p = 0.03). and increased use of ACE inhibitors, statins, aspirin and vitamin D. The intervention had no effect on smoking cessation, body weight, physical activity, or sodium excretion. CONCLUSION: Risk factor management improved in both groups. However, changes in BP control, lipid management, and drug use were more pronounced in IG than in CG. Lifestyle interventions were not effective. Coaching by NPs therefore benefits the day-to-day care of CKD patients. Whether these changes translate into improvements in clinical endpoints remains to be determined.",0,0,
1294,"Nurse-led motivational interviewing to change the lifestyle of patients with type 2 diabetes (MILD project): protocol for a cluster to implement lifestyle recommendations, randomized, controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Many patients' diabetes is managed in general practice"";"" Health care providers aim to promote healthy behaviors such as a healthy diet, adequate physical activity and smoking cessation. These measures can reduce insulin resistance, improve glycemic control, lipid abnormalities, and hypertension. They can also prevent cardiovascular diseases and complications of diabetes. However, professionals do not follow lifestyle counseling guidelines optimally. Motivational interviewing to change the lifestyles of patients with type 2 diabetes aims to improve diabetes care in accordance with national guidelines for lifestyle counselling. Primary care nurses will be trained in motivational interviewing embedded in structured care in general practice. The purpose of this article is to describe the design and methods of a study evaluating the effects of nurse education on patient outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster, randomized, controlled trial of 70 overall treatments (35 treatments in the intervention arm and 35 treatments in the control arm) starting March 2007. A total of 700 patients with type 2 diabetes will be included in the study. Patients in the intervention arm will receive care from a primary care nurse who will be trained in an implementation strategy with motivational interviewing as the key component. Other components of this strategy will be educational and supportive tools for adapting the diabetes protocol to local conditions, introducing a social map for lifestyle support, and maintaining motivational interviewing. The control arm will be encouraged to maintain normal maintenance. Impact measures will be the course of care, metabolic parameters (glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and lipids), lifestyle (diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol), health-related quality of life, and patients' willingness to change their behavior. Measurements will be made at baseline and after 14 months. DISCUSSION: The application of motivational interviewing for patients with diabetes in primary care has been studied, but to our knowledge, no other study has yet evaluated the practicality and sustainability of motivating and involving patients in daily diabetes care in general practice. If this intervention proves to be effective and cost-effective, large-scale implementation of this nurse-focused intervention will be considered and anticipated.

1295,"Nurse-led, telephone-based outreach to improve lipids in people with diabetes","BACKGROUND: Randomized prospective trials of resource utilization analyzes and case management interventions are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether algorithm-based phone care by nurses improves lipid control in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes at a federally funded community health center were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 381) or usual care (n = 381) groups. INTERVENTIONS: Nurses independently initiated and titrated lipid therapy and promoted behavior change through motivational interviewing and self-management techniques. Other parameters of diabetes care were considered based on time constraints. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dL. Secondary outcomes included the number of hospital admissions, total hospital charges per patient, and the proportion of patients meeting other lipid, glycemic, and blood pressure guidelines. KEY RESULTS: The percentage of patients with LDL < 100 mg/dL increased from 52.0% to 58.5% in the intervention group and decreased from 55.6% to 46.7% in the control group (P < .01). The mean cost to the healthcare system per patient was less for the intervention group ($6600 vs. $9033, P = .03). Intervention patients tended to have fewer hospitalizations (P = .06). The intervention did not affect glycemic and blood pressure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can improve lipid control in patients with diabetes, mainly in a poor population, through telephone care using moderately complex algorithms, but a more targeted approach is warranted. Phone-based access can reduce resource usage, but more work is needed.",0,0,
1296,Evaluations of nurses regarding the use of CPOT 12 months after the application in the intensive care unit,"BACKGROUND: Routine pain assessments with all intensive care unit (ICU) patients are strongly recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Because many ICU patients do not self-report, the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) is one of two behavioral pain scales recommended for clinical use. However, there are no studies describing evaluations of its use in daily practice in the intensive care unit. OBJECTIVE: To describe nurses' assessment of feasibility, clinical relevance, and satisfaction with the use of CPOT 12 months after its application in the ICU. METHOD: A descriptive design was used. It was conducted in the medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated setting in Greenfield Park (Quebec, Canada). A self-administered assessment questionnaire containing four sections (ie, feasibility, clinical relevance, satisfaction, and socio-demographic information) was completed by ICU nurses, all trained to use the CPOT. The questionnaires were filled in anonymously. RESULTS: A total of 38 intensive care nurses returned the completed questionnaire (63% participation rate). Regarding its applicability, the majority rated CPOT as fast to use, simple to understand and easy to complete (92-100%). Based on clinical significance, approximately 70% of ICU nurses agreed that CPOT affected their practice, but lower results (<50%) were found for effective communication of pain assessment findings with physicians and other healthcare professionals. More than 80% of intensive care nurses were satisfied with daily use. CONCLUSION: According to the evaluations of the nurses, the use of CPOT was found to be applicable and appropriate in daily practice, but it did not allow effective communication with other ICU care team members. RELATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: All members of the ICU care team should be trained and other practice strategies should be explored to ensure optimal adoption of a pain assessment approach that influences decision-making processes for pain management.",0,0,

1298,Nurses' representations of caring for mentally handicapped patients and perceived needs to provide quality care,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: To explore nurses' representation in caring for people with intellectual disabilities, the intervention strategies they currently use, and identify needs to provide quality care. BACKGROUND: Nurses work in many settings and with a variety of clients. Certain customers have needs that require special approaches, for example people with intellectual disabilities. The care provided to these patients may be influenced by the representations of the nurses caring for them. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 nurses working in hospital and community settings using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nurses are concerned with the ability to recognize the special nature and complex needs associated with patients' mental disabilities, promote quality care by managing behavioral and communication difficulties, and also cope with the perceived lack of time and organization in the work environment. . Current strategies include trying to promote continuity of care. Participants also identified learning needs that were relational and informative in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses typically appear to be mindful of providing quality care to patients with intellectual disabilities and acknowledge that there are many contextual and practical elements that need improvement to ensure the safety of these patients. RELATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses should be trained to accommodate and encourage findings from existing research showing that people with intellectual disabilities want to be part of their local communities. This can be facilitated by the adoption of specific guidelines, protocols and maintenance programmes. More research focusing on self-advocacy and health promotion techniques is needed to better understand the expectations of these patients and their caregivers in order to develop personalized standards of practice and reduce health education disparities for these patients.",0,0,
1299,Nurses' strategies to address self-care aspects related to medication adherence and symptom recognition in heart failure patients: an in-depth look.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the increasing knowledge about self-care in heart failure patients, the need for effective interventions remains. We sought to deepen the understanding of interventions used by heart failure nurses in clinical practice to improve patient compliance with medication and symptom monitoring. METHODS: A qualitative study with directed content analysis was conducted using data from a selected sample of Dutch-speaking heart failure nurses who filled out booklets containing two vignettes of medication adherence and symptom recognition. RESULTS: Nurses regularly evaluate and reassess patients before deciding on an intervention. They evaluate the basic/factual information and obstacles in a patient's behavior and try to find room for improvement in the patient's behavior. Interventions used by heart failure nurses to increase medication adherence and symptom monitoring are grouped under the themes of increasing knowledge, increasing motivation, and providing practical tools to patients. Nurses also described using technology-based tools, increased social support, alternative communication, partnership approaches, and coordination of care to improve medication adherence and symptom monitoring. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong focus on educational strategies, nurses also reported other strategies to increase patient compliance. Nurses use a variety of strategies not included in the guidelines to improve patient compliance. These interventions need to be evaluated for further applications to improve heart failure management.",0,0,

METHODS: The Office of Maternal and Child Health, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services convened a committee of pediatric obesity experts to develop recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The committee recommended that children with obesity complications who have a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 85th percentile, or with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile, with or without complications, should seek evaluation and possible treatment. . Clinicians should be aware of the manifestations of rare exogenous causes of obesity, including genetic syndromes, endocrinological diseases, and psychological disorders. They should screen for complications of obesity, including hypertension, dyslipidemias, orthopedic disorders, sleep disorders, gallbladder disease, and insulin resistance. Conditions that require consultation with a pediatric obesity specialist include pseudotumor cerebri, obesity-related sleep disorders, orthopedic problems, massive obesity, and obesity in children younger than 2 years. Recommendations for treatment evaluation included an assessment of the patient's and family's readiness to participate in a weight management program, and a focused assessment of diet and physical activity habits. The primary goal of obesity treatment should be healthy nutrition and activity. The use of weight maintenance and weight loss to achieve weight goals depends on each patient's age, baseline BMI percentage, and presence of medical complications. The committee recommended treatment that starts early, involves the family, and gradually creates lasting change. Parenting skills are the foundation of successful intervention that provides gradual, targeted activity increases and targeted reductions in high-fat, high-calorie foods. Ongoing support for families after the initial weight management program will help families maintain their new behavior.

1306,Observational study of telephone interviews by stroke specialists supporting community tissue plasminogen activator delivery,"OBJECTIVES: Barriers to the use of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke include the limited treatment experience of community physicians. Acute stroke care models are designed to address these limitations by providing community support. These include telephone or televideo support, with or without subsequent transfer to tertiary care centers. The authors describe the frequency, characteristics, and impact of community phone calls to a 24/7 stroke ""helpline"" staffed by stroke doctors at an academic stroke center using such a model. METHODS: Twelve intervention hospitals participating in Incremental Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Modification Tactics (INSTINCT) were provided with a single access number (""helpline"") for specialist advice on tPA use. The specialists consisted of doctors trained in stroke at an academic medical center. Helpline use was not mandated by the study protocol and patient transfer was not required. Counselors were asked to log all treatment questions in a Web-based diary. All patients discussed on the helpline and/or treated with tPA at an INSTINCT hospital underwent multilevel chart review by trained nurse coordinators. Cases were associated with recorded helpline calls based on duration of treatment and hospital first treated. Physician reviewers evaluated the suitability of tPA therapy, deviation from standard guidelines, and treatment complications (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], systemic hemorrhage, or death). RESULTS: A total of 204 telephone lines were called on 116 patients during 27 months. 91 percent of calls were between 8 am and midnight, and 77% of questions explored eligibility for IV tPA, specifically minor stroke or stroke amelioration (26%). A total of 243 patients were treated with IV tPA in 12 intervention hospitals, 54 of which followed the hotline. Seventy-six percent of patients for whom tPA was recommended actually received tPA, while 2% of those for whom tPA was not recommended received the drug. There was no difference in protocol deviations (27.8% helpline group vs 23.8% no helpline group), incidence of symptomatic ICH (5.6% vs 7.3%), or in-hospital mortality (5.6% vs 13.2%). No medico-legal problem was reported for any case in the study. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible and safe to provide tPA decision-making support to community physicians by telephone consultation. Consultants can play a more important role than acceptance in determining tPA non-compliance. Future studies should include a real-time survey of physician providers to identify such potential qualitative benefits of a stroke helpline.",0,0,

However, they primarily reflect the views of advocates and supporters and may not represent the views of the ""average"" clinician or researcher. In this study, we sought to explore the perceived challenges associated with rare cancer care and potential solutions approved by oncologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A representative sample of 420 oncologists from 13 cancer centers participated in a nationwide survey. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists treat patients with rare cancers, including lack of clinical practice guidelines (65.7%) and personal experience (65.2%), lack of approved treatment options (39.8%) and reimbursement issues (44.5%). faced various difficulties. . They generally supported the recent recommendations of the professional communities as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives for the development of open clinical practice guidelines (66.0%), flexible reimbursement guidelines (52.9%), and a national rare cancer registry (47.4%).

Methods Mixed methods, ""pre/post move"" comparison of four nested case study wards in a single 100% single room acute hospital; two control hospitals vs. pre-post-experimental study; analysis of capital and operating costs associated with single rooms. Results Two-thirds of patients said they preferred single rooms with comfort and control that outweighed the disadvantages (feeling of isolation) felt by some. Patients were satisfied with the privacy, privacy and flexibility that single rooms provide. Staff perceived improvements (patient comfort and privacy), but single rooms were worse in terms of visibility, surveillance, teamwork, monitoring and keeping patients safe. Staff walking distances increased significantly after the move. A temporary increase in falls and medication errors in a ward was likely related to the need to adjust work patterns rather than single rooms. We found no evidence that single rooms reduce infection rates. Building a fully one-room hospital may cost 5% more with higher cleaning and cleaning costs, but the difference is marginal over time. Results Staff needed to significantly adapt their work practices and felt unprepared for new ways of working with potentially significant long-term effects on the nature of teamwork. Staff preference remained for a mix of single rooms and coves. Patients preferred single rooms.",0,0,
1310,One-year outcomes of surgical and nonsurgical treatments for discogenic back pain: a prospective population-based cohort study.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: ""Discogenic back pain"" is controversial at baseline levels, including its clinical status, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and optimal treatment. This is true despite the existence of four randomized studies comparing the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatments. One trial demonstrated the benefit of lumbar fusion compared to unstructured nonsurgical care, and the other three showed roughly similar results for lumbar surgery and structured rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of community-based surgical and nonsurgical treatments in patients with chronic back pain due to degeneration at the level of one or both lumbar discs. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients presenting with axial back pain to academic and private practice orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in a large metropolitan area. OUTCOME MEASURES: Roland-Morris back injury score (primary outcome), current rating of overall pain severity on a numerical scale, measures of back and leg pain discomfort, physical function scale of short form 36 version 2 questionnaire, pain, job status, emergency room visits, hospitalization hospitalizations and subsequent surgeries. METHODS: Patients who had spine surgery within 6 months of enrollment were designated as the ""surgical treatment"" group and the rest as ""non-surgical treatment"". Results were evaluated 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. RESULTS: We brought 495 patients with discogenic back pain to 16 surgeons' offices for initial surgical consultation. Eighty-six patients (17%) underwent surgery within 6 months of enrollment. Surgery consisted of instrumented fusion (79%), disc replacement (12%), laminectomy or discectomy (9%). Surgical patients reported more severe pain and physical disability at baseline and were more likely to have had previous surgery. Adjusting for baseline differences between groups, surgical intervention showed limited benefit over nonsurgical treatment of 5.4 points on the modified (23-point) Roland disability questionnaire (primary outcome) 1 year after enrollment. Using a combined definition of success that included 30% improvement in Roland score, 30% improvement in pain, no opioid pain medication, and study (if appropriate), the 1-year success rate was 33% for surgery and 15% for nonsurgical treatment. treatment.

1311,Continuous provision of individual clinician performance data improves practice behavior,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines summarize the evidence from science and attempt to translate these findings into clinical practice. Widespread and consistent adoption of these guidelines into log provider practices has proven slow. METHODS: Using postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis guideline compliance as our metric, we compared the effects of continuing medical education (CME) alone (I), a single snapshot of provider compliance of CME (II), and provider ongoing reporting. compatibility data (III) without further CME. We retrospectively analyzed the guideline compliance of 23,279 anesthetics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Compliance was defined as a patient with 1 risk factor for PONV who received at least 1 antiemetic, 2 risk factors for at least 2 antiemetics, and 3 risk factors who received at least 3 antiemetics. Drugs in the same class were counted as the only antiemetic administration. Propofol-based anesthetic techniques counted as taking 1 antiemetic. Patients with 0 risk factors for PONV were not included. We estimated compliance rates for each of the 4 time periods of the study by adjusting for multiple observations on the same clinician. Individual performance feedback was given every 6 months after intervention I with a refresher presentation on PONV (initiation of intervention II) and continuously quarterly during intervention III. RESULTS: Compliance rates were not significantly affected by CME (intervention I) compared to baseline behavior (54.4% vs. 54.4%, P = 0.9140). A significant improvement occurred during the time period when CME was paired with performance data (intervention II) compared with intervention I (59.2% vs. 54.4%, P = 0.0002). Compared with intervention II (intervention III), more significant improvements occurred when data were presented alone (intervention III) (65.1% vs. 59.2%, P < 0.0001). For patients with 3 risk factors, we saw significant improvement in compliance rates during intervention III (P = 0.0002). In the post hoc analysis of overtreatment, the percentage differences between baseline and time period III decreased as the number of risk factors increased. RESULTS: We observed the greatest improvement in guideline compliance with continued personal performance feedback. Provider feedback can be an effective tool to change clinical practice, but it can have unexpected consequences.",0,1,
1312,Online interventions for social marketing health behavior change campaigns: a meta-analysis of psychological architectures and adaptation factors.,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online interventions that encourage people to reduce their alcohol consumption, increase their exercise, and better manage their weight. Motivations to develop eHealth interventions may be driven by Internet access, interaction, cost-effectiveness, and studies showing that online interventions work. However, when designing appropriate online interventions for public campaigns, there are few evidence-based guidelines, classifications are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and previous meta-analyses do not apply to large-scale public campaigns targeting voluntary behavior change. OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis evaluated online intervention design features to inform the development of online campaigns, such as those used by social marketers seeking to promote voluntary health behavior change. Another goal was to increase understanding of the relationships between intervention commitment, study commitment, and behavioral outcomes. METHODS: Based on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 query terms across 5 bibliographic databases was used with additional gray literature review. This resulted in 1271 abstracts and articles""; 31 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 29 articles describing 30 interventions were included in the primary meta-analysis, and 2 additional studies qualified for concordance analysis. Using the random effects model, initial analysis, control estimated the overall effect size, including groupings by conditions and time factors. The second analysis evaluated the effects of psychological design features encoded with classifications from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive technology, and other behavioral domains. was integrated into the coding framework model. Finally, the third analysis evaluated the associations between intervention compliance and behavioral outcomes.

1313,"Operations research as an applied science: definitions, challenges and research priorities","Background Operations research (OR) is the discipline of using quantitative or qualitative models to aid decision making in complex application problems. Operating room methods have been used in healthcare since the 1950s in various fields such as emergency medicine and the interface between acute and community care; hospital performance; planning and management of patient home visits; scheduling patient appointments; and many other complex application issues of an operational or logistical nature. Discussion To date, there has been limited discussion of the role that operations research should play in applied science. For OR, I detail three such roles, all of which are based on prior systems thinking: structuring implementation problems, prospective evaluation of remediation interventions, and strategic restructuring. Case studies in mental health, emergency medicine, and stroke are used to illustrate each role. I then describe the challenges of the applied operating room within applied science at the organizational, interventional, and disciplinary levels. Two main challenges are the difficulty in achieving a position of mutual understanding between practice scientists and research users and the incomplete assessment of operating room interventions. To overcome these challenges, I propose a research agenda to evaluate the applied OR through applied science, liberating the OR from the environment of specialist research and consulting, and collaborative design of models with service users. Summary Operations research is a mature discipline that has developed a substantial amount of methodologies to improve healthcare. OR, it offers application scientists the opportunity to do more systems thinking before committing resources or taking risks. OR has three roles in practice science: a tool for structuring a practice problem, a prospective assessment of practice problems, and a strategic restructuring of healthcare. The challenges faced by OR as a science of practice include limited evidence and impact assessment, limited service user involvement, lack of managerial awareness, effective communication between research users and OR modelers, and availability of health data. To advance the science, three key areas need to be focused: evaluating OR interventions, embedding OR information into healthcare, and educating OR modelers about the goals and benefits of service user engagement.",0,0,

Improving the performance of preventive maintenance in general practice,"BACKGROUND: Preventive care is an important role for general practitioners, but opportunities for prevention are often missed. METHOD: We provided an automatic electronic record preventive maintenance reminder system for 12 preventive maintenance activities for one 10 doctor's practice. All participating patients were randomized according to the last digit of their registration number. RESULTS: Opportunistic prevention has low uptake of control"";"" It ranges from 1.5% (tetanus vaccine) to 27% (flu vaccine). Reminders increased this by significant but small amounts for four of the 12 activities (tetanus and pneumococcal immunization and allergy and weight registration), insignificant increases in four (mumps, measles and rubella immunization, smoking registration and cervical smear collection). and blood pressure) and significantly reduced flu vaccination and screening for diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

1317,Optimal care models for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"There is a close relationship between physiological respiration and swallowing processes in all levels of neuromotor control and peripheral function in healthy adults. Little is known about potential changes in these patterns in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the impact of dysphagia and aspiration on the health outcomes of patients with COPD may be significant. COPD is a common comorbidity seen by swallowing clinicians in patients with head and neck cancer and neurological disorders and requires consideration during swallowing therapy. This article summarizes reports of changes in nutritional status, airway protective mechanisms, and swallowing efficiency that potentially contribute to or exacerbate a chronic and debilitating pulmonary condition. Care guidelines are given for modifying eating and swallowing behavior to optimize the COPD patient's health status. The need for controlled clinical trials to validate the impact of these care guidelines on clinical outcomes has been described.",0,0,

METHODS: We describe the rationale and methods of the Maternal and Child Health-Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) study, an application science project examining strategies for providing HIV care and treatment to HIV-infected women and HIV-infected women who begin ART during pregnancy. RESULTS: The MCH-ART consists of 3 interrelated study designs throughout the prenatal and postnatal periods. Phase 1 is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women seeking antenatal care”; Phase 2 is an observational cohort of all women in phase 1 who are eligible to begin ART according to local guidelines; and phase 3 is a randomized trial.

1319,Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice,"There is a clear relationship between high blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the large number of treatment guidelines, hypertension remains poorly controlled and only a minority of patients achieve target BP levels. Many factors, both patient- and physician-related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Major determinants include the application of inappropriate treatment regimens that fail to enable patients to achieve their goals, and poor patient compliance. For example, it is widely accepted that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to achieve their BP goal”; however, physicians may be reluctant to use such treatment strategies. The purpose of this review is to choose combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations. Our aim is to explore the factors that contribute to poor hypertension control rates, including the rationale, and how to overcome them.",0,0,
1320,Optimizing hypertension management with combination therapy: considerations for the nurse practitioner,"Hypertension is a major contributor to the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, but success in achieving blood pressure (BP) control has been limited. Most patients will need 2 or more medications to control their blood pressure. Nurse practitioners play a vital role in the management of patients with hypertension and can help overcome barriers to achieving BP goals. Measures to improve therapeutic adherence include educating the patient and simplifying the medication regimen. The use of single-pill combination therapy, which reduces the pill burden, may contribute to improved drug retention and adherence. Rational combination therapy combines drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor"";"" it is generally more effective than monotherapy and allows lower doses of the individual ingredients to be used, which often results in better tolerability. Current guidelines support the first-line use of combination therapy in many patients. Starting treatment with an RAAS inhibitor-based combination may reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk and may be more effective in some patients than traditional combinations such as a beta-blocker with diuretics. Adverse events associated with any drug may compromise its therapeutic benefit. Peripheral edema is a common dose-related adverse event seen with dihydropyridine CCBs that can cause significant patient distress, reduce adherence, and lead to dose reduction or even treatment discontinuation. In most cases, peripheral edema caused by CCB can be successfully managed and CCB therapy need not be abandoned. Management strategies include non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures. Several clinical studies have shown a lower incidence of peripheral edema in patients receiving combination therapy with CCB and RAAS blocker compared to CCB monotherapy.",0,0,
1321,"Oral contraceptives and smoking, current considerations: recommendations of a consensus panel.","In a closed meeting, members of the consensus panel considered the scientific panel's presentations and developed a set of recommendations. They summarized the clinical imperatives of identifying and educating patients who smoke, the physician's role in smoking cessation, and prescribing oral contraceptives to smokers. They also set research goals for the future. The most important recommendations are: At each visit, all patients should be asked about their smoking status, and all smokers should be encouraged and helped to quit. The decision to prescribe oral contraceptives requires a detailed personal and family history of thrombotic disease. Measurement of lipid profile with exercise and dietary intervention should be considered in smokers over 35 years of age who use or request oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptive use should be refused in patients older than 35 years of age and heavy smokers (>15 cigarettes/day). Initial data suggest that an oral contraceptive containing a very low dose of 20 micrograms of ethinyl estradiol may be safer for oral contraceptive users who smoke, even for those over 35 who are occasional smokers, but these laboratory findings require clinical validation.""; ""PIP: This article summarizes the activities of a conference titled ""Oral Contraceptives and Smoking: Current Considerations"" held in Montreal, Canada.

1324,Orbital/Periorbital Plexiform Neurofibromas in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Multidisciplinary Recommendations for Care,"SUBJECT: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant condition, present with a variety of ophthalmologic conditions. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) involving the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can cause significant vision loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause significant changes in physical appearance due to proptosis, ptosis, and facial disfigurement, resulting in social embarrassment and reduced self-esteem. CLINICAL APPLICABILITY: Although NF1 is a relatively common disease for which routine ophthalmologic examinations are required, no formal recommendation exists for the clinical care of children with OPPN. While medical and surgical interventions have been reported, there are no agreed criteria for when OPPNs require treatment and which treatment works best. METHODS: The absence of a uniform outcome measure representative of visual or aesthetic sequelae complicates evidence design, as a multidisciplinary team of experts (oculofacial plastics, pediatric ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, medical genetics, and neuro-oncology) guides management decisions. based studies and applicable clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force of pediatric practitioners from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for children with OPPN convened to address the lack of clinical care guidelines for children with OPPN.

1325,Oversight organization in GI application,"BACKGROUND: Various reports have documented the inefficient use of available resources as well as inadequate compliance with surveillance recommendations. Surveillance protocols often rely on unorganized approaches, although evidence suggests that organizational issues can affect the quality of care provided. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for guidelines, Database of Abstracts of Effects Studies, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (published 01/2000-06/2016), practice questionnaires for intervention studies to improve adherence to guidelines, patients or reporting information on the attitudes and behavior of providers. Related articles were also reviewed. Based on clinical relevance and the burden on endoscopy services, this review focused on surveillance for post-polypectomy surveillance of Barrett's esophagus, IBD, and colon adenomas. CONCLUSIONS: While current guidelines generally recognize the structure and process requirements that affect the delivery of surveillance interventions, less attention has been paid to transitions and interfaces in the maintenance process. The available evidence from practice surveys highlights the need to design institutional strategies aimed at ensuring patient participation and providers deliver timely and appropriate care. However, well-designed studies evaluating the effectiveness of certain interventions in this setting are lacking. Indirect evidence from screening settings will suggest that the implementation of automated standardized recall systems, use of clinical records, removing financial barriers, may improve eligibility for use and adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of robust evidence regarding the utility and methodology of surveillance may contribute to explaining the observed variability in providers and patients' attitudes and compliance with recommended surveillance.",0,0,
1326,Organization theory for dissemination and application research,"Background Even under optimal internal organizational conditions, practice can be undermined by changes in the external environment of organizations such as fluctuations in funding, adjustments in contracting practices, new technology, new legislation, changes in clinical practice guidelines and recommendations, or other environmental changes. . Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in implementation frameworks, but detailed explanations of how organizations' external environments affect implementation success are lacking in implementation research. Organizational theories provide practice researchers with a range of available, highly relevant and hitherto largely unused explanations of the complex interaction between organizations and their environments. In this article, we demonstrate the usefulness of organizational theories for application research. Discussion We applied four well-known organizational theories (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, probability theories, and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice to prevent child abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained how often uncertain processes to contract for SafeCare create inefficiencies and thus jeopardize practice among private child welfare agencies. Institutional theory explained how child welfare systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare, as it aligns with the expectations of key stakeholders in child welfare systems' professional communities. He explained how efforts such as emergency theories, interagency collaborative teams support the implementation of SafeCare by facilitating adaptation to the internal and external contexts of child welfare agencies. Resource dependency theory (RDT) explained how inter-agency relationships supported by contracts, memoranda of understanding, and negotiations facilitate SafeCare implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funders and SafeCare developers. Summary In addition to the retrospective application of organizational theories shown above, we advocate the proactive use of organizational theories to design practice research. For example, implementation strategies should be chosen to minimize transaction costs, encourage and maintain harmony between organizations' dynamic internal and external contexts over time, and respond to the financial needs of organizations while simultaneously maintaining their autonomy. We describe the results of applying organizational theory in practice strategies, evaluation of practice efforts, measurement, research design, theory and practice research for practice. We also guide practice researchers to apply organizational theory.",0,0,
1327,Osteoporosis prevention education: behavioral theories and calcium intake,"Osteoporosis is a worldwide health problem. Prevention of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures has become the goal of many health practitioners, especially dietetics. However, several prevention models have proven effective. The purpose of this project was to determine whether an educational, theory-based osteoporosis prevention program would significantly affect calcium intake. This project used a convenient sample of 42 women participating in an 8-week educational intervention, similar to a community class. The program included hands-on activities to increase self-efficacy and was based on the Health Belief Model and Theory of Rational Action (TRA). The main outcome measures were calcium intake and constructs from the Health Belief Model and TRA. Significant changes in the Health Belief Model and TRA constructs after intervention include increased perceived susceptibility to osteoporosis (P < .001), perceived benefits of increased calcium intake ( P < .001), and increased self-efficacy related to calcium intake ( P < . /=.003). ). Statistically significant regression equations were found for all calcium-related pre-intervention intentions.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial nested within a basic cross-sectional study of body mass index (BMI). Randomization and outcome measurement, but not participants, were blind to group assignments. SETTING 45 family practices (66 GPs) in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS A BMI questionnaire was administered to 3958 children who visited their general practitioners between May 2005 and July 2006. Of these, 258 children aged 5 years 0 months and up to their 10th birthday who were overweight or obese according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria were randomized into intervention (n=139) or control (n=119) groups. Children who were very obese (UK BMI z score >or=3.0) were excluded. INTERVENTION Four standard consultations over 12 weeks aimed at change in nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behavior, supported by purpose-designed family materials. Main outcome measures The primary measure was BMI at 6 and 12 months after randomization. Secondary measures were 7-day accelerometer mean activity count/min, nutrition score from 4-day shortened food frequency diary, and child health-related quality of life. Differences were adjusted for socioeconomic status, age, gender, and baseline BMI. RESULTS Of 781 eligible children, 258 (33%) participated""; attrition was 3.1% at 6 months and 6.2% at 12 months. The adjusted mean differences for BMI at 6 and 12 months (intervention vs control) were -0.12 (95%). CI -0.40 to 0.15, P=0.4) and -0.11 (-0.45 to 0.22, P=0.5) for physical activity in counts/minute, 24 (-4 to 52, P=0.09) and 11 (- 26 to 49, P=0.6);"" and 0.2 (-0.03 to 0.4, P=0.1) and 0.1 (-0.1 to 0.4, P=0.2) for the nutrition score. There was no evidence that he harmed the child. The cost of the healthcare system was significantly higher in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS Primary care screening followed by brief counseling did not improve BMI, physical activity or nutrition in overweight or mildly obese 5-10 year olds and would be very costly if applied universally.

1331,"Overweight and obesity in pregnancy: the evidence-practice gap in staff knowledge, attitudes and practices.","BACKGROUND: Statewide (Queensland) Clinical Guidelines reflecting current best practices have recently become available for the management of pregnancy-associated obesity. However, dissemination of guidelines alone does not change practice. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the evidence-practice gap in the multidisciplinary management of overweight and obesity in pregnancy (ow/ob) and inform an intervention that will facilitate the translation of obesity guidelines into practice in a tertiary maternity service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire available over a three-week period (May-June 2011) was distributed to obstetrics, midwives and allied health personnel. Outcomes of interest included a 15-point guideline compliance score, knowledge of guideline content, advice given, information about obesity-pregnancy-related complications, previous education, and referral patterns. RESULTS: Eighty-four staff completed the surveys (57% response rate). Widespread incompatibility with the guideline was noted. The majority (88.1%) reported overweight/obesity (ow/ob) as an important/very important general obstetric problem and most accurately identified the associated complications. However, only 32.1% were aware of existing guidelines and only half correctly defined BMI categories for ow/ob. Compliance with referral recommendations varies"";"" 20% of staff thought the referral was 'not their business'. CONCLUSIONS: Staff are aware of the negative consequences associated with the mother's ow/ob, although few fully comply with referral guidelines or advise in line with recommendations.

1332,Oxygen therapy in hospitalized patients: impact of local guidelines,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of local guidelines on the behavior of nurses and health personnel to optimize oxygen use in hospitalized patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in a district training hospital. The guidelines produced recommended indications, monitoring, use of arterial blood gases (ABGs), and recommendations on when to stop oxygen therapy. The guidelines were administered to all nursing and healthcare personnel, both orally and in writing, before and after an audit examining patients' oxygen use in medical and surgical wards. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included in the pre-intervention control and 59 patients in the post-intervention study. Oxygen prescription remained unchanged compared to guidelines 30% (27/90) and 32% (19/59). Nurses administered oxygen 95% (18/19) and 70% (19/27) better (P = 0.043) and were monitored more frequently using oximetry 91% (54/59) and 69% (62/90) (P = 0.001) ) after the instructions.

DESIGN: Systematic search and review. DATA SOURCES: PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE and manual search. REVIEW METHODS: Included were peer-reviewed English, quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research articles published between 1990 and 2012 investigating the practice of pediatric postoperative pain management by registered nurses. Articles that focused on nurses' pain management practices in the recovery room in neonatal or pediatric intensive care units and/or focused on children with cognitive impairment were excluded. The search terms used were: ""postoperative pain""; nurses*; pediatrics; pediatrics; children; pain assessment; non-drug*; analges*. Titles and summaries were used for initial screening. Two researchers evaluated data extraction and rigor for each. RESULTS : Included 27 studies from the first 248 citations. Most studies were descriptive and examined relationships between personal factors and nurses' pain management practices. Observational data from four articles added insights beyond what was provided in self-report studies. Two articles used experimental designs with vignettes. Data were categorized under four headings. included: pain assessment; pharmacological applications; non-pharmacological applications;"" and factors affecting applications. Despite the developments in the application of analgesics in the last 20 years, the applications remain insufficient. Children's behavior appears to influence nurses' assessment of pain more than approved measures. Pain scores were not recorded in the first 24 hours after surgery in a significant proportion of children. Children receive more analgesia than necessary. However, prescription of analgesia around the clock did not guarantee administration. Nurses routinely report using several non-pharmacological strategies, but some are not evidence-based. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show that nurses' assessment and management of children's pain is not in line with published guidelines. The results of studies investigating factors related to nurses and children are insufficient. The research needs to examine the effect of organizational factors on nurses' pain care practices. Intervention studies are needed to identify the most effective strategies for nurses to support and improve pain care for children.",0,1,
1334,Pain descriptors for critically ill patients who cannot self-report,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the descriptors used by nurses in two Canadian intensive care units to document the presence of pain in critically ill patients who cannot self-report. BACKGROUND: Systematic documentation of pain assessment is essential for continued communication and pain management, thereby providing better pain control, maximizing recovery, and reducing physical and psychological sequelae. METHOD: A retrospective, mixed method with observational design in two Level-III intensive care units of a quaternary academic center in Toronto, Canada. For the period 2008-2009, data were summarized through chart review guided by a reference summary of potential behavioral descriptors compiled from available behavioral pain assessment tools. RESULTS: A total of 679 narrative explanations were extracted. Behavioral descriptors (232, 34%), physiological descriptors (93, 14%) and descriptors indicating that the patient was pain free (117, 17%) were used to define the presence or absence of pain. The narratives also described analgesia administered without pain assessment descriptors (117.17%) and assessment and administration of analgesics (30.4%) prior to a known painful procedure. The themes that emerged included life-threatening treatment intervention, decision-making uncertainty, and constant vigilance. CONCLUSION: Inconsistent or unclear documentation was problematic in this example. This may reflect confusing behavior and accompanying security priorities. Developing a glossary of pain assessment descriptors in critically ill patients who cannot self-report for use with valid and reliable measures may improve documentation that facilitates appropriate analgesic management. Protocols or unit guidelines that prioritize a trial of analgesia prior to administration of sedatives can reduce decision uncertainty when patients display ambiguous behaviors such as agitation or restlessness.",0,0,

1336,Parallel pathways to improve heart failure outcomes: evidence matters,"Gaps and inequalities between heart failure education given by nurses and the performance of patients with advanced heart failure in performing self-care behaviors may be factors in clinical decompensation and unplanned healthcare consumption. Is nurse-led education delivered effectively prior to hospital discharge? Nurse leaders must understand the power of nurses' knowledge base on self-care principles and important barriers to best practice. Nurses may not be comfortable teaching patients about dry weights, meal planning, heart failure medications, or progressive activity and exercise steps. Also, clinical nurses may not have time to provide in-depth education to patients before discharge. Equally important, research is needed to learn about factors that increase patients' adherence to heart failure self-care behaviors, because adherence to the recommendations of national, evidence-based heart failure guidelines improves clinical outcomes. Therefore, nurses and patients are on parallel paths in laying the foundation for improved self-care compliance in advanced heart failure. Through research, we have found that nurses are not adequately prepared as heart failure educators and patients do not believe they can control their heart failure. In 2 educational intervention studies aimed at helping patients understand that they can control their fluid management and follow a strict daily fluid limit, patients improved clinical outcomes. Therefore, misperceptions about heart failure can be overcome with interventions that go beyond communicating ""what"" self-care behaviors that are recommended. Research results reflect that evidence matters! There is a need for systems and processes that will support nurses' knowledge, convenience and frequency of providing self-care training before discharge, increase the accuracy of patients' beliefs about controlling heart failure, and increase patients' willingness to self-adhere to heart failure recommended in the guideline. -care behaviors. This article describes the development of parallel pathways of nurse and patient research programs and explores the translation of findings into practice and the development of clinical translation research.",0,0,
1337,Parental presence during invasive procedures and resuscitation: evaluation of clinical practice change,"Rationale: Parental presence during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation is a relatively underdeveloped and controversial practice. Much of the worry stems from the concern of the medical community. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the implementation of formal practice guidelines and relevant interprofessional training improves clinicians' sense of preparedness and provides parents with comfort in presenting options during their child's procedures. METHODS: Multistage pre-post investigation of (1) clinician perceptions and (2) practice from the perspectives of clinicians and parents who have experienced the same procedure. Data were collected over 4 years from a cardiovascular and critical care program in a US children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More than 70% of clinicians participated in the perception questionnaires (n = 782) and 538 clinicians and 274 parents participated in the practice questionnaires. After intervention, clinicians reported that parents were present during more invasive procedures and reported a higher level of comfort with the practice of providing parents with options during resuscitative events. Comfort levels were higher in clinicians who practiced skills in a simulated learning environment. In both stages, few clinicians reported that parental presence affected their technical performance (4%), therapeutic decision making (5%), or teaching skills (9%). Next, clinicians reported more active parental behavior during procedures. Parents who reported receiving information to help their children prepare for their procedures reported a higher level of procedural understanding and emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of practice guidelines and interprofessional training had a positive impact on clinicians' perceptions and practice while providing options and support to parents during their child's invasive procedures and/or resuscitation.",0,0,
1338,Parental intervention in Sure Start services for children at risk of developing conduct disorder: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a parenting program as a preventive intervention with parents of preschool children thought to be at risk of developing conduct disorder. DESIGN A pragmatic randomized controlled trial using a domain allocated block design. SETTING Eleven Sure Start areas in North and Wales. PARTICIPANTS 153 parents and their children aged 36-59 months from socially disadvantaged regions are at risk of behavioral disorder, which is defined by scoring over clinical cut-off in the Eyberg child behavior inventory. Participants were randomized on a 2:1 basis, 104 to intervention and 49 to waiting list (control). Eighteen (13%) of the intervention group dropped out of follow-up after six months. INTERVENTION The Webster-Stratton Incredible Years core parenting program, a 12-week group-based intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Problematic behavior and parenting skills in children are assessed by self-reports from parents and direct observation at home. Parenting efficacy, stress, and depression self-reported by parents. Standardized and well-validated tools were used throughout. RESULTS At follow-up, most measures of parenting and problem behavior in children improved significantly in the intervention group. For the primary outcome measure, the Eyberg child behavior inventory, intent to treat analysis showed a mean difference between the groups with an effect size of 0.63 on the problem scale of 4.4 points (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 6.9, P<0.001), and 25.1 on the intensity scale with an effect size of 0.89. (14.9 to 35.2, P<0.001) mean difference.

1339,Parenting program for parents of children at risk of developing conduct disorder: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a parenting program. DESIGN A pragmatic, randomized controlled trial as well as an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of the effectiveness of a group parenting program delivered through Sure Start in the Community. Surah AYAR starting areas in north and central Wales. PARTICIPANTS Parents of 116 children aged 36-59 months (87% of the clinical sample) are at risk of developing behavioral disorders, which are defined by scoring the clinical cut-off in the Eyberg child behavior inventory. Children were identified by health visitors and recruited by the research team. INTERVENTION Webster-Stratton Incredible Years basic parenting program or a six-month waiting list check. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Incremental cost per unit of improvement in the density score of the Eyberg child behavior inventory. RESULTS The bootstrapped incremental cost-effectiveness rate point estimate was £73 (EUR109, $142) per one point improvement in intensity score (95% confidence interval £42 to £140). Bringing the child with the highest intensity score below the clinical breakpoint would cost 5486 (EUR 8190, 10,666) and bringing the average child in the intervention group within the non-clinical limits would cost 1344 (EUR 2006, $2618). by intensity score (below 127). For a cap rate of £100 (EUR 149, 194) per point increase in the intensity score, the probability of the intervention being cost effective is 83.9%. The average cost per child joining the parenting group was £1934 (€2887, US$3760) for eight children and £1289 (€1924, US$2506) for 12 children, including start-up costs and materials for training group leaders. When we divided the sample into relatively mild, moderate, and severe behavioral groups based on baseline intensity scores, the intervention appeared to be more cost-effective in those at highest risk of developing conduct disorder. CONCLUSION This parenting program improves child behavior at a relatively low cost, as measured by the density score of the Eyberg inventory of child behavior, and is cost-effective compared to waiting list control. This parenting program has modest costs and strong clinical impact; this suggests that it would represent good value for money for public expenditures.",0,0,

1341,Participant and study-related characteristics predictive of treatment completion and study continuation in an adolescent smoking cessation trial.,"Objective: To determine which factors predict the completion and continuation of smoking cessation treatment in adolescents. Methods: In a multisite, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness of motivational interviewing was compared with brief structured recommendations for smoking cessation and reduction in 14-18 year-old adolescents (n = 355) (55% female, 45% black, 12%). Spanish). Treatment was spread over 12 weeks with follow-up evaluations at 24 weeks. Completion of treatment was defined as the completion of all five counseling sessions. Study retention was defined as the completion of the 24-week evaluation. Participant and study variables served as predictors of treatment completion and retention. Results: In total, 79% of participants completed all five counseling sessions and the same 24% completed the weekly assessment. Black race, anticipation phase to nap, and shorter time between baseline assessment and initial counseling session were significantly associated with treatment completion. For each 7.5-day delay in starting treatment after the baseline visit, there was a 50% reduction in the probability of completing all five treatment sessions. At 24 weeks, detention was estimated by black race, younger age, more maternal education, expectations of college graduation, and structured brief advice intervention. Conclusions: High treatment completion and study retention rates can be achieved in a multi-session behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in adolescents. The findings suggest that therapy should begin immediately after the intake session to maximize treatment completion. Increasing efforts to retain older adolescents and youth with lower academic goals and lower family incomes will be important in future studies.

1344,Participatory action research in antimicrobial management: a new approach to improving antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals and long-term care facilities.,"Changing the antimicrobial prescribing behavior of physicians is difficult. Although antimicrobial prescribing is determined by contextual (eg, lack of guidelines), cultural (eg, peer practice) and behavioral (eg, perceived decision-making autonomy) factors, most antimicrobial management programs do not consider these factors in their approach. This can lead to insufficient response effectiveness. We present a new approach to antimicrobial stewardship program development that addresses the relevant determinants of antimicrobial prescribing: participatory action research (PAR). PAR is a collaborative process that aims to bring about change in social situations by generating practical knowledge that is useful in local practice. It requires substantial involvement of relevant stakeholders to address the determinants of behavior under consideration and facilitate empowerment. PAR is well suited for complex problems in multidisciplinary environments, as it adapts to local needs, offering a tailored approach to improving native application. We describe how PAR can be applied to antimicrobial management and the PAR design of two ongoing multicenter antimicrobial management projects in the acute care setting and the long-term care setting, respectively.",0,0,

In 1997, a primary health care center, a health management organization in rural Israel, established a 1-year program in which family physicians were encouraged to remind their patients to have a breast cancer examination. This study evaluates the impact of physician intervention on patient compliance. METHODS: Family physicians from two practices were asked to discuss the importance of early breast cancer diagnosis with all eligible patients who come to the clinic for any reason, and assist in making an appointment for screening. The files of patients who received the recommendation were stamped accordingly. Upon completion of the program, physicians' files were audited and potential candidates for breast cancer screening were divided into two groups: those who received the intervention (n = 251) and those who did not (n = 187)""; ""results also showed that those who went to the examination on their own initiative (n = 100) before the study (n = 100) The results were also compared with the results of a third group of patients (i.e. no intervention). A random sample of half of the patients also filled out an ad hoc questionnaire covering sociodemographic variables and the impact of doctors' intervention on their behavior. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group showed a significantly greater change in behavior related to breast cancer screening than controls (32% vs. 13%, P = 0.001). This change was particularly evident in the group of women aged 50-74 years who received a mammogram recommendation (according to the guidelines). CONCLUSION: Although this was only a two-practice study, the results show that primary care physicians can significantly change their patients' behavior regarding regular breast examinations. The use of a specific reminder can also help the individual physician ensure that each patient is appropriately informed.",0,0,
1348,Patient advocacy and advance care planning in the acute hospital setting,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explain the role of patient advocacy in the Advance Care Planning (ACP-ing) process. Nurses consider prolonging the death process and protecting patients' rights as the most disturbing ethical issue with inappropriate precautions (Johnston et al. 2002). Paradoxically, ethical codes assume that nurses have the autonomy to support patients' health care choices. Advanced Directives (ADs) designed to improve end-of-life care are poorly addressed and acute hospitals are often not tailored to the small number of people they receive. The Respect for Patient Choices Program (RPCP) improves the use of AD by providing a supportive framework for ACP-ing and primarily equipping nurses as RPC consultants. Helping patients in this process requires qualities that are consistent with patient advocacy, which is the most fundamental principle of nursing, which stems from caring for others. DESIGN: Likert Scales questionnaire administered to pilot and control groups with overlapping focus groups before and six months after the intervention. Setting: Selected wards at an acute care public hospital in South Australia. SUBJECTS: Nurses in palliative care, respiratory, renal and colorectal pilot services, and hemoncology, coronary care, cardiology, and neurology/geriatric control services. RESPONSE: (RPCP) RPCP during 2004-2005 South Australian pilot. MAIN RESULTS: Institutional endorsement of ACP-ing gave nurses autonomy to become patient advocates for end-of-life care, reconciling clinical practice with ethics, and easing the distress of inappropriately prolonging the death process. RESULTS: Statistically significant survey results in the post-intervention group showed that nurses were experienced: “encouragement (84%) to enable patients to make informed choices about end-of-life treatments”; the ability to fulfill these wishes in practice (73%) and the results of providing appropriate end-of-life care. job satisfaction (67%);"" compared to about half (42-55%) of participants in the pre-intervention and control groups. Focus group participants shared that it used to be difficult to advocate for patients, but now they can act legally and feel ethically comfortable with end-of-life care. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested by the patient advocacy supported by the supportive RPC environment influence the ACP-ing process. It is recommended that the RPCP be adopted and developed as an integral part of promoting quality end-of-life assurance and related job satisfaction.",0,0,
1349,Patient and physician reminders to promote colorectal cancer screening: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths, but effective screening tests are underutilized. Systematic reminders to patients and physicians can increase screening rates Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patient and physician reminders in 11 outpatient settings. Participants included 21,860 patients aged 50 to 80 years and 110 primary care physicians who were overdue for colorectal cancer screening. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the mail containing an educational brochure, stool occult blood test kit, and instructions for direct programming of flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive electronic reminders during office visits with patients overdue for screening. The primary outcome was fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy for 15 months, and the secondary outcome was detection of colorectal adenomas. Results Screening rates were higher in patients who received mail (44.0% vs 38.1%""; P < .001). The effect increased with age: +3.7% for 50 to 59 years old; +7.3% for 60 to 69 years old. and +10.1% (P = .01 for trend) for patients aged 70 to 80 years (P = .01 for trend) Screening rates were similar between patients of physicians receiving electronic reminders and the control group (41.9% vs. 40.2%; P = .47). electronic reminders tended to increase screening rates in patients with 3 or more primary care visits (59.5% versus 52.7%; P = .07). 4.9;"" P = .09).

1350,Patient education about cough: impact on counseling behavior of general practitioner patients,"The purpose of this general practice study is to examine how the counseling behavior of patients with cough is affected when the roles and responsibilities of patients, practice nurses, and practitioners are reorganized. The effects of a rational cough practice policy on patients' counseling behavior and the provision of systematic patient education on cough were compared with patient behavior in four matched control practices across four 'mean' one-handed general practices. Behavioral changes were measured in 548 patients who presented for coughing at least twice in two consecutive autumn-winter periods. Significantly more patients in the experimental practice changed their behavior to follow practice guidelines than patients in the control practices (56% vs 30%, P less than 0.001). The proportion of patients who continued to be consulted as approved was higher among patients who received intervention (66% versus 66%, P less than 0.001). This was equally true for patients who had fewer than four coughing episodes or more than four coughing episodes. The more often patients received the training, the more effective it was. All patients who applied to the general practitioner for cough in the first autumn-winter period filled a cough diary in the second period. From this it appeared that the intervention did not cause patients to delay the consultation when they had a cough lasting longer than three weeks or had a cough with 'severe' symptoms. A rational practice policy and the provision of patient education can encourage patients to change their counseling behavior. This can result in a reduction in healthcare costs.",0,0,
1351,Patient education for colon cancer screening: a randomized trial of a video submitted prior to the physical exam.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening is underutilized and primary care clinicians are obligated to provide patient education within the constraints of intensive practice. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of an educational video sent to patients' homes prior to physical examination on colorectal cancer screening, particularly sigmoidoscopy performance. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: 5 primary care practices in central Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: 938 patients aged 50 to 74 years scheduled for an upcoming physical examination, with no personal history of colorectal cancer and eligible for lower endoscopy screening according to current guidelines. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n = 488) or a video about colorectal cancer, the importance of early detection, and screening options (n = 450). MEASUREMENTS: Baseline and 6-month follow-up phone evaluations were made. A dependent variable was classified from baseline as 1) sigmoidoscopy with or without other tests, 2) another test or combination of tests, or 3) no test. RESULTS: Overall screening rates were the same (55%) in the intervention and control groups. In regression modeling, intervention participants were nonsignificantly more likely to complete sigmoidoscopy, either alone or in combination with another test (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.70]). Intervention dose (at least half of the video viewed) was significantly associated with receiving sigmoidoscopy with or without another test (odds ratio, 2.81 [CI, 1.85 to 4.26]). Recruitment records showed that at least 23% of people who come for periodic health evaluations are currently screened with a lower endoscopy procedure and are therefore ineligible. LIMITATIONS: The primary care sample studied consisted primarily of middle-class white people with high initial screening rates. Results cannot be generalized to other populations. The trial was conducted at a time when increased health insurance coverage for low endoscopy procedures and public media attention was paid to colon cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: A mailed video had no effect on the overall colorectal cancer screening rate and only modestly improved sigmoidoscopy screening rates among patients in primary care.",0,0,
1352,Patient Engagement Programs for the Recognition and Initial Treatment of Depression in Primary Care,"Significance Encouraging primary care patients to address their depression symptoms and referral to clinicians may improve outcomes, but may also result in unnecessary treatment. Purpose To determine whether a depression engagement video (DEV) or an adapted interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) improves initial depression care compared to a control without increasing unnecessary antidepressant prescriptions. Design, Environment, and Participants Randomized clinical trial comparing DEV, IMCP, and control among 925 adult patients treated by 135 primary care clinicians (603 patients with depression and 322 without depression, defined by the Patient Health QuestionnaireÂ¨C9 [PHQ-9] score) June It was conducted at 7 primary care clinical centers in California from 2010 to March 2012. Gender and income interventions DEV, an IMCP tailored to individual patient characteristics, and a sleep hygiene video (control).

1353,Patients' perceptions of risky drinking: daily and weekly low-risk guidelines and knowledge of standard drink sizes,"BACKGROUND: Effective intervention for risk drinking requires clinicians and patients to know the low-risk daily and weekly guidelines and what constitutes a ""standard drink."" The authors assumed that most patients lacked this knowledge and that education was necessary. METHODS: After primary care visits, patients ask, ""How many drinks (containing alcohol) can you safely drink in a day?"" They completed anonymous exit questionnaires containing 3 Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questions. and questions about the size in ounces of a standard wine, beer, and liquor beverage. Descriptive analyzes were performed in Stata. RESULTS: Of the 1,331 participants (60% female, mean age: 49.6, SD = 17.5), 21% tested positive for risk drinking on the AUDIT-C. Only 10% of correctly estimated daily low risk limits, 9% of weekly limits are correct and half of the low risk limits estimated at or below the guidelines. Less than half of those who answered “yes” to the question “Do you know what a standard drink” was? gave correct answers for beer, wine, or liquor. Patients with screen positive were twice as likely to say they knew what a standard drink was, but only one-third gave accurate predictions. When asked about their plans for the next month regarding change in drinking behavior, 23% with AUDIT-C positive indicated that they were considering at least a change. RESULTS: Most primary care patients were diagnosed with the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) low Does not know the specifics of risk-drinking guidelines. Investigating patients' perceptions of low-risk guidelines and current drinking behaviors may reveal controversial inconsistencies. For risk drinkers, who do not know most of the daily and weekly low-risk guidelines or standard drink sizes, education may be vital in the intervention. Findings suggest low-risk What exactly does drinking mean? It shows that there is a need for detailed and clear social marketing and communication.",0,0,
1354,Patient safety research: an overview of the global evidence,"Background Unsafe medical care can cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, despite uncertain estimates of the extent of the problem. To better understand the scope and nature of the problem of unsafe care, the WHO World Alliance for Patient Safety commissioned a review of the world literature on patient safety research. Methods Major patient safety issues were identified through a consultation and research process and categorized within the framework of the nature, process, and outcomes of unsafe care. Leading experts reviewed the available evidence and identified key knowledge gaps on issues in developing, transitional and developed countries. The report was reviewed by internal and external experts and improvements were made based on feedback. Results Twenty-three major patient safety issues were examined. Most evidence of the consequences of unsafe care comes from developed countries, where prevalence studies show that between 3% and 16% of hospitalized patients suffer from medical care. Data from transitional and developing countries also show significant medical harm. However, significant knowledge gaps about the structural and process factors underlying globally unsafe care make it difficult to identify solutions, especially in resource-poor environments. Interpretation Harm from medical care appears to be a significant burden for the world's population. However, most of the evidence base comes from developed countries. Understanding the scope and solutions for unsafe care for the rest of the world is a critical component of delivering safe and effective care to all citizens of the world.",0,1,
1355,Patient safety: the doctor's perspective,"Medical errors can be defined as the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended or the use of an incorrect plan to achieve a goal. Errors, beyond their economic costs and costs in human life, cause patients to lose their trust in the health system and decrease the satisfaction of both patients and health professionals. There are many evidence-based safety-oriented behaviors and interventions that can be easily implemented, such as ultrasound-guided central venous catheter placement, prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection, and more. The development of research on patient safety in vascular access has raised several issues that require work to provide an optimal patient safety approach. Patients are the biggest contributors to their own safety, and therefore doctors must develop a new approach to involve them in the decision-making cycle at every step of their treatment. Along this path, there are many opportunities for the patient to engage in safe behaviors and for the access team to provide these behaviors using simple strategies. The emergence of the access center based on multidisciplinary teamwork has increased the potential to improve patient safety by preventing errors in planning and performing access surgery, preventing delay in treatment of access failure, and improving communication between team members. However, significant research effort is still needed to implement the intervention with evidence-based data focused on patient safety.",0,0,

Methods: A randomized prospective single-blind study of 28 family physicians and nine general internists was conducted in private practice offices in rural eastern North Carolina. Twenty-two physicians were randomized to the computer prompt group and 22 to the card prompt group. Four physicians in the computer group did not complete the study due to computer software problems, and three physicians did not complete the study because their limited staff could not enter patient data into the computer. Before the intervention, 20 patient files (10 male and 10 female) from each physician were inspected for influenza vaccination, stool for occult blood, pap smear, breast examinations by physicians, and mammograms. One year after the start of the intervention, rescheduling controls were performed for the above five items in 20 different patient charts for each physician. Results: There was a 7% increase in the performance of flu vaccines in the card group (24% versus 17%) compared to a 6% increase in the computer group (26% versus 20%). There was a 5% decrease in stool performance for occult blood in the card group (23% versus 28%) compared to a 1% increase in the computer group (31% versus 30%). There was an 11% decrease in pap smear performance in the card group (26% vs 15%) compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (26% vs. There was a 2% decrease (33% vs 35%) in the performance of physician-performed breast exams in the card group compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (33% vs. Finally, there was a 3% increase in the performance of mammograms in the card group (25% vs. 22%) compared to an 11% increase in the computer group (26% versus 15%). Conclusions: Our data show a greater increase in the performance of health care items in the computer assisted group. Stool performance for occult blood, pap smear, doctor-performed breast exams, and mammography increased more in the computer-assisted group than in the card group. However, there was no statistically significant difference after intervention for any of the health care items supervised for the computer group or the card group.

At 12 months, 92% of 106 participants achieved the therapeutic target (SUA</=360 micromoles);"" 85% had SUA<300 micromol/l. Allopurinol was the most widely used ULT, requiring an average daily dose of 400mg to achieve the goal. Improvements were observed in Short Form-36 (significant for pain) after 1 year. CONCLUSION: A predominantly nurse-led intervention that includes education, lifestyle advice, and ULT can successfully achieve the recommended treatment goal in more than 9 out of 10 patients. Full disclosure and discussion of the nature of gout and treatment options and the individualization of management likely explain this success.",0,0,
1358,"Pearls, dangers, and pitfalls in the assessment and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adolescents","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide clinicians with an updated overview of key issues in the clinical assessment and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents. RECENT RESULTS: The American Psychiatric Association's recently revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 included significant changes in the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recently revised its Clinical Practice Guidelines for ADHD"";"" Whereas previous guidelines focused on children aged 6-12, new guidelines extend to age 17. Understanding these revised diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines is essential for pediatricians and others dealing with adolescents. In addition to an updated review of the clinical approach to the assessment and treatment of ADHD in adolescents, recent findings regarding common comorbidities, psychosocial risks, and long-term outcomes are briefly described. SUMMARY: Diagnosis and treatment of adolescents with ADHD presents unique challenges and barriers. Clinicians need to exercise caution when evaluating a young person with recent onset symptoms suggestive of ADHD, considering other conditions that may mimic ADHD, and to screen for common comorbid conditions. In terms of the treatment of adolescents, the AAP recommends drug therapy as a first-line intervention, noting that stimulants have a much broader evidence base and larger effect size than non-stimulants. Although clinicians now have a large number of drug formulations to choose from, they also need to be alert to the potential for abuse and diversion of stimulants.",0,0,
1359,Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Management of Child Anxiety with an Evidence-Based COPE Program in a Rural Primary Care Clinic,"INTRODUCTION: Anxiety is the most common mental health disorder in children. There is a shortage of mental health providers in many communities, and many children with anxiety do not get the evidence-based treatment they need. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effects of Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE), a short seven-session cognitive-behavioral skills development intervention given to anxious children by a pediatric nurse in primary care. adjustment. METHODS: Pre-experimental, single-group, pre-test and post-test design were used. RESULTS: Significant reduction in anxiety symptoms (13.88 points, SD = 17.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.13-28.89) and increased knowledge of cognitive-behavioral coping skills (Mean = 11.38, CI = 5.99-8.26, p = .00) and enhanced functionality (at school and at home). Reviews by parents and children were positive. CONCLUSION: COPE is a promising evidence-based intervention for children with birth anxiety that can be implemented by pediatric nurse practitioners in primary care.",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled. DETERMINATION 20 common practices in the east of the Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS 395 patients (192 in the intervention group, 203 in the control group) and 29 peer supporters with type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION All practices brought a standard diabetes care system. The peer support intervention spanned a two-year period and included four elements: the recruitment and training of peer supporters, nine group meetings led by the peer supporters in the participant's own general practice, and a retention plan for the peer supporters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES HbA(1c)""; cholesterol concentration; systolic blood pressure;"" and well-being score. RESULTS There was no difference between intervention and control patients at baseline. All applications and 85% (337) of the patients were followed up. At two-year follow-up, HbA(1c) (mean difference -0.08%, 95% confidence interval -0.35% to 0.18%), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg, -8.9 to 1 ,1 mm) there was no significant difference. Hg), total cholesterol concentration (-0.03 mmol/L, -0.28 to 0.22 mmol/L), or well-being scores (-0.7, -2.3 to 0.8). In particular, systolic blood pressure (52% (87/166) >130 mm Hg) v 61% (103/169) >130 mm Hg in control), these changes were not significant. The process evaluation showed that although 18% (35) of the patients in the intervention group had never attended any group meetings, the intervention was generally performed as intended. CONCLUSIONS A group-based peer support intervention could be implemented in general practice settings, but was not effective when the intervention targeted all patients with type 2 diabetes. While there is a trend towards improving clinical outcomes, the results do not support the widespread adoption of peer support. Trial registration Available Controlled Trials ISRCTN42541690.",0,0,

NA data, self-efficacy efficacy and outcome expectations included the performance of knowledge and function-oriented care. RESULTS: Residents were mostly female, white and widowed; needed some help with activities of daily living; and engaged in very few PAs based on subjective and objective reports. NAs were mostly female and black, had more than ten years of nursing experience, strong confidence, but limited knowledge of function-oriented care, and performed this care in 76% of observed care interactions. There were no site-specific differences in beliefs, knowledge, or performance of function-oriented care among NAs. There were region-specific differences among residents in self-efficacy for functional ability; functional performance; social support from experts for exercise;"" and from family, person-environment fit and PA based on subjective questionnaires. No differences were noted based on actigraphy. CONCLUSION: Those living in AL communities engage in very limited numbers of PAs and staff working in these sites. can benefit from continuing education on how to increase PA among residents and help them comply with current guidelines for PA to optimize their overall health.",0,0,
1362,Performance of the TREAT decision support system in an environment of low prevalence of resistant pathogens.,"Objectives To evaluate a decision support system (TREAT) to guide empirical antimicrobial therapy in an environment of low prevalence of resistant pathogens. Methods A retrospective trial of TREAT was conducted at Copenhagen University Hvidovre Hospital. The patient cohort included adults with systemic inflammation and suspected community-acquired bacterial infection. Empirical antimicrobial therapy recommended by TREAT was compared with empirical antimicrobial therapy prescribed by the first attending clinician. Results Of the 171 patients enrolled in the study, 161 (65 with microbiologically documented infections) met the inclusion criteria of TREAT. Coverage achieved with TREAT was significantly higher than clinical practice (86% vs. 66%, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the cost of future resistance between treatments chosen by TREAT and treatments chosen by physicians. Direct expenditures for antimicrobials were higher in TREAT when patients without antimicrobial therapy were included, with no otherwise significant difference. The cost of side effects was significantly lower when TREAT was used. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that TREAT may improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy and reduce the cost of side effects in areas with low prevalence of resistant pathogens, at the expense of increased antibiotic use.",0,1,
1363,Perioperative care map improves adherence to best practices for the morbidly obese,"BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity can complicate perioperative management. Best practice guidelines have been published, but are generally followed only in bariatric patients. Little is known about physicians' awareness of and adherence to these clinical recommendations for non-bariatric operations. Our study evaluated whether an educational intervention could improve physician recognition and adherence to best practices for all surgically treated morbidly obese patients. METHODS: A map of care outlining best practices for morbidly obese patients was distributed to all surgeons and anesthetists in 4 teaching hospitals in 2013. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires were sent to participants in 2012 and 2015 to assess changes in clinical practice. A post-intervention chart audit determined the physician's compliance with the distributed guidelines. RESULTS: In the study, 567 physicians completed the questionnaire in 2012 and 375 physicians in 2015. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the percentage of surgeons and anesthetists who reported changing the management of morbidly obese, surgically treated patients after intervention. best practices preoperatively (89% vs. 59%), intraoperatively (71% vs. 54%), post-operatively (80% vs. 57%), and overall (88% vs. 72%). to suit. Results were similar when surgeons and anesthesiologists were analyzed separately. A chart audit of 170 cases from 4 hospitals found that 167 (98%) cases adhered to best practices. CONCLUSION: After the care map distribution, the percentage of physicians who reported changing their management to comply with best practices improved significantly. These findings highlight the beneficial effect this educational intervention can have on physician behavior. Continued research is needed to evaluate the impact of this intervention on clinical outcomes.",0,0,

1365,Person-Centered Primary Care Strategies for Evaluation and Intervention of Aggressive Behaviors in Dementia,"With the increasing number of individuals affected by dementia, it is imperative that healthcare providers are knowledgeable about the most effective ways to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms such as aggression. Managing aggression can be particularly difficult because it poses a risk of harm to formal and informal caregivers, and medical intervention options are complex and context-dependent. Although there are multiple guidelines for the management of aggression in dementia in the literature, their scope is widespread and the treatments recommended are often variable, making decision making difficult for busy clinicians. Using a composite case as a model, the current article provides guidelines that guide outpatients through the steps necessary to provide effective treatment for aggression in individuals with dementia. Shifting the current focus of healthcare for aggressive dementia patients to a more human-centred approach will have a positive impact on patient care.

1366,Pharmaceutical care in chronic kidney disease: experience at University Hospital Grenoble from 2006 to 2010,"BACKGROUND: Clinical pharmacists (CPs) specifically administer laboratory test follow-up, adjust drug dosage according to guidelines, and assess cardiovascular risk factors and decline in renal function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of clinical pharmacy services in outpatient nephrology clinics. METHODS: Medical history and current treatment were obtained for each patient. Each intervention was classified according to the Act-IP document of the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy. This tool contains definitions and guidelines for preventing and resolving drug-related problems (DRPs). RESULTS: From January 2008 to April 2009, 42 patients seen by SP at at least 2 visits were included in the study. We observed 350 pharmaceutical consultations and 263 interventions. Related pharmaceutical interventions: untreated indication (30%), underdose (25.9%), and overdose (18.3%). CP interventions consisted of: dose adjustment (42.2%) and treatment addition (31.9%). The main drugs involved were cardiovascular (33.1%), digestive-metabolic (28.6%) and hematopoietic (21.6%) systems. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of a CP in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is essential for the identification and prevention of IIPs. In addition to the medical improvement of CKD patients, CP participates in the development of prescription recommendations and therapeutic education programs for patients. It has also proven the effectiveness of redefining the roles and practices of clinical team members in optimizing the medical care of CKD patients. In addition, the patient's admission to dialysis is delayed, which leads to a reduction in health insurance costs.",0,0,
1367,Pharmacoeconomic consequences of measuring and modifying hospital drug use,"Drug use patterns affect hospital-based healthcare delivery in several ways. Adverse reactions to drugs (ADR) accelerate approximately 5% of admissions and adversely affect the care of approximately 20% of hospitalized patients, while prolonging inadequate drug therapy outcomes and length of hospital stay. Conversely, appropriate administration of medications can promote recovery and improve the quality of care. Well-documented examples include the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and postoperative wound infections. Accordingly, optimization of drug use represents an important quality assurance challenge in addition to determining the cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Drug use review (DUR) requires all elements of the quality assurance process. In practice, therapeutically meaningful and cost-effective exercises can only be established if there is knowledge of the link between drug use patterns and clinical outcomes. These measurement processes are currently rate-limiting in quality assurance. There are several ways to measure hospital drug use. These range from readily available and relatively inexpensive quantitative methods to methods that require the availability of skilled personnel. There are a number of methods that include increasing costs and increasing resource demands, providing increased details of the information obtained. This sequence begins with pharmacy purchases, followed by pharmacy issues to specific clinical areas, prescription or treatment sheet research, clinical record review, and finally reports from trained researchers working in the clinical field. Simpler methods can provide useful information and a fruitful basis for selecting and planning definitive investigations. When a category of drug use is appropriately targeted for intervention, drug use can in many cases be replaced by planned intervention with improved clinical outcomes and reduced economic costs. Intervention strategies to change drug use can be classified as reeducational, persuasive, facilitating, and power strategies. Other models for implementing behavior change have been considered, including the influence of trained researchers and the use of online computer prescribing with interactive software with appropriate guidelines. The challenge is to achieve sustained change when interventions are implemented. Low-cost quality assurance of drug use with modest resources is possible if results-oriented activities are prioritized.",0,0,

This review summarizes the complexity of bipolar disorder and its diagnosis among young people. It continues to review pharmacotherapy principles, evaluate current treatment options, and highlight areas where evidence-based guidance is lacking. Recent advances have broadened the range of potential treatments for bipolar disorder. However, the differences in the phenomenology, course, and sequelae of bipolar disorder among young people warrant greater attention to the benefits and obligations of treatment for those affected by the early onset of this illness.

1372,Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium,"In the 21 years since CP entered diagnostic terminology, important information has been obtained about effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. Although good evidence demonstrates the efficacy of benzodiazepines, SSRIs have emerged as first-line pharmacological therapy""; MAOIs; and anticonvulsant agents such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also emerging evidence for the efficacy of the new antidepressant venlafaxine, as well as the potential benefit of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. There is also optimism. However, there are many areas that require further research. There has been great excitement about the publication of the RUPP Anxiety Study, which shows the efficacy of fluvoxamine in socially phobic youth. Given that CP begins in childhood and adolescence, early intervention can prevent the sequelae of chronic CP. , more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group. Further research is needed on what is required for social phobic individuals who respond well to pharmacotherapy to reach a state of complete remission. Comparative studies of different drug classes Additional research is needed to evaluate its efficacy and develop an improved ability to predict treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, more research is needed on resistance to treatment. In most of the anxiety disorders examined, combining CBT with psychopharmacological treatment showed little advantage over either treatment alone. These findings may be due to methodological problems. Research is needed on how to rank treatments to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments. Finally, many clinicians see an increasing trend in individuals who have not been treated for CP in their lifetime and are now seeking treatment in their ""golden years"". Current established therapies need further evaluation in this geriatric population.",0,0,
1373,The Pharmacy Asthma Care Program (PACP) improves outcomes for patients in the community.,"Background: Despite national disease management plans, optimal asthma management remains a challenge in Australia. Community pharmacists are in an ideal position to implement new strategies aimed at ensuring that asthma treatment meets current best practice standards. The effect of the Pharmacy Asthma Care Program (PACP) on asthma control was evaluated using a multisite randomized intervention versus control repeated measures study design. Methods: Fifty Australian pharmacies were randomized into two groups: intervention pharmacies administered PACP (an ongoing cycle of assessment, goal setting, monitoring and review) to 191 patients over 6 months, while control pharmacies administered 205 control patients their usual care. Both groups administered questionnaires and performed spirometric tests at baseline and 6 months later. The main outcome measure was asthma severity/control status. Results: 186 (91%) of 205 control patients and 165 (86%) of 191 intervention patients completed the study. The intervention resulted in improved asthma control: patients who received the intervention were 2.7 times more likely to improve from ""severe"" to ""not severe"" than control patients (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.64 to 4.37""; p< Intervention also improved adherence to preventative medication (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.30; p?=?0.03), reducing the mean daily dose of reliever medication (difference -149.11 µg, 95% CI -283.87 to -14.36; p? =?0.03) in the drug profile, switching from relaxer only to a combination of inhibitor, long-acting ÃŸ agonist or no ÃŸ agonist reliever (OR 3.80, 95% CI 1.40 to 10.32; p?=?0.01), and improved scores mismatch risk (difference -0.44, 95%) CI -0.69 to -0.18; p?=?0.04), quality of life (difference -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.00; p?=?0.05), asthma knowledge (difference 1.18, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.63; p <0.01) and perceived control of asthma questionnaires (difference -1.39, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.35; ""p<0.01).

1374,Prescription physical activity (PAP) from the GP's perspective - a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Prescription physical activity (PAP) is a successful intervention to increase physical activity in patients with sedentary lifestyles. The method appears to be infrequently used by general practitioners (GPs), and there is limited information available about general practitioners' attitudes towards counseling using PAP as a tool. The aim of the study was to explore and understand the meaning of prescribing physical activity from the GP perspective. METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted in southern Sweden with a purposive sample of 15 Swedish GPs. Participants were invited to talk about their experience using PAP. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four categories: Tradition makes it difficult to change attitudes, Shared responsibility required, PAPs have low status and are viewed with distrust, and Lack of procedures and clear guidelines. Traditionally, GPs talk to patients about the importance of increased levels of physical activity, but do not recommend physical activity as a treatment. Physicians' education focuses on drug use. Responsibility for the physical activity level of patients is shared with other healthcare professionals, patients and the community. General practitioners express reservations about prescribing physical activity. A heavy workload is a source of frustration. PAP is viewed with distrust and considered a task of lesser value and status. Using a prescription to highlight an increased level is considered unnecessary, and GPs feel that it should be given by someone else in the healthcare system. Doubts about the outcome of the method were also expressed. CONCLUSION: There is uncertainty about the use of PAP as a treatment because physicians do not have training on non-drug methods. GPs do not view written referral as a primary task and instead turn to other professionals in the healthcare system to prescribe PAP. GPs noted the need to create routines and regulations for the method to gain credibility and become daily practice among GPs.",0,0,
1375,Doctor's Advice on Smoking for Adolescents: Who Gets Advice and Who Benefits The Most?,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical Practice Guidelines instruct physicians to ask their patients about smoking and to advise against tobacco use. Due to the increased sensitivity of these groups to smoking, doctors are urged to deal with racial minorities and youth in particular. Research on race and doctor's recommendations against smoking has produced conflicting findings. The aim of this study is to reveal the relationships between physician communication about tobacco, race and smoking among adolescents. METHODS: This cross-sectional retrospective study investigated (1) racial differences in rates of receiving physician communication and (2) whether the association between physician communication and smoking among adolescents is governed by race. Multiple measures of smoking status were used (eg, intentions to quit, attempts to quit, quits, relapse status). We used a large (N = 5,154), predominantly African-American (82.9%) sample of grade 11 students. RESULTS: Regular smokers were more likely to be screened for smoking. African Americans were advised against tobacco more often than Caucasians. Among African Americans, nonsmokers were more likely to be both screened and recommended"";"" Among Caucasians, regulars were most likely screened and recommended. Overall, physician intervention was associated with greater benefits for young African Americans, including less intent to smoke, more likely to quit, and fewer relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Physician communication about smoking may be particularly promising for African-American youth by reducing health disparities due to racial differences in smoking-related mortality and morbidity. Physicians should be encouraged to screen and advise all youth about tobacco, regardless of race or smoking status.",0,0,
1376,Physician and patient predictors of evidence-based prescribing in heart failure: a multi-level study.,"BACKGROUND: The management of patients with heart failure (HF) must take into account the variable and complex individual clinical characteristics. The use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAAS-I) to target doses is recommended by the guidelines. But although little is known about physicians and patients' factors predicting compliance, it seems that physicians do not adequately follow this recommendation. METHODS: To examine the consistency of primary care (PC) physicians' knowledge of the RAAS-I and their self-perceived competence with their prescribing behaviors regarding patient-related disabilities. Cross-sectional follow-up study after a randomized trial of medical education intervention with a seven-month observation period. PC physicians (n = 37) and patients with systolic heart failure (n = 168) from practices in Baden-Württemberg. Measures included knowledge (plan-based multiple choice test), self-perceived efficacy (questionnaire about global confidence in treatment and frequency of RAAS-I use), and patient variables (age, gender, NYHA functional status, blood pressure, potassium level, kidney function). Prescribing was collected from the documentation of the trials. The target variable consisted of >/= 50% of the recommended RAAS-I dose investigated by the two-level logistic regression models. RESULTS: Patients (69% male, mean age 68.8 years) were symptomatic and objective left ventricular (NYHA II vs III/IV: 51% vs 49% and mean LVEF 33.3%) and renal (GFR/=50%) showed. Reasons for improvement in RAAS-I prescribing were patient age (OR 0.95, CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.01), physician's general confidence in follow-up (OR 1.09, CI 1.02-1.05, p = 0.01), and NYHA class (II vs. III). /IV) (OR 0.63, CI 0.38-1.05, p = 0.08) CONCLUSIONS: A change in physician confidence as a predictor of RAAS-I dose escalation is a novel finding that may reflect the intervention effect of improved physicians.

1377,Physician and patient willingness to pay for electronic cardiovascular disease management,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important target for electronic decision support. We examined the potential sustainability of an electronic CVD management program using a discrete selection experiment (DCE). Our aim was to estimate physician and patient willingness to pay (WTP) for existing and improved programs. METHODS: Focus groups, expert input, and literature searches decided on qualifications to be evaluated for physician and patient DCEs conducted using a Web-based program. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis, estimated preference coefficients for each participant, and latent class analysis partitioned each sample. The simulations were used to estimate WTP for each of the features separately and for an advanced vascular management system. RESULTS: 144 participants (70 physicians, 74 patients) completed DCE. Overall, speed of access to updated records and monthly payments for a nurse coordinator were the main determinants of physician selection. Two distinct segments of physicians were identified – one very sensitive to the monthly subscription fee and speed of updating the tracker with new patient data, and the other very sensitive to the nurse coordinator's monthly cost and government billing incentives. Patient choices were most affected by the annual subscription cost. Estimated physician WTP was slightly above the estimated threshold for sustainability while below patient WTP. CONCLUSION: Current willingness to pay for electronic cardiovascular disease management should spur innovation to achieve economies of scale in program development, implementation and maintenance to meet sustainability thresholds.",0,0,
1378,Physician attitudes towards diffusion of optical spectroscopy devices for cervical cancer control: an industrial-academic collaborative study.,"BACKGROUND: Optical spectroscopy has been studied for biological plausibility, technical efficacy, clinical efficacy, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: We tried to determine the attitudes or practices of the health care provider that may prevent the spread or spread of this new technology. METHODS: Through an academic-industrial partnership, we conducted a series of focus groups to examine physicians' barriers to optical diagnosis. The study was carried out in 2 stages. First, a pilot group of 10 doctors (8 obstetrician-gynecologists and 2 family practitioners) from 8 regions of the United States was randomly selected and interviewed individually with each doctor. Physicians were presented with the results of a large trial (N = 980) testing the accuracy of a spectroscopy-based device in detecting cervical neoplasia. They were also shown a prototype of the device and given time to ask questions about the device and get answers. They were also asked to provide feedback on a questionnaire that was later revised and submitted to 3 larger focus groups (n = 13, 15 and 17 for a total of N = 45). Larger focus groups were conducted during national scientific meetings with 20 obstetrician-gynecologists and 25 primary care physicians (family practitioners and internists). CONCLUSIONS: When asked about the potential for new cervical screening technology to spread, all study groups tended to rely on established clinical guidelines from their professional community regarding the screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer. Additionally, study participants consistently agreed that real-time spectroscopy would be well received by their patients. Participants were positive about the potential of the new technology in addition to colposcopy and agreed that improved accuracy would result in reduced healthcare costs (due to reduced biopsies and reduced visits). While all participants saw the potential of real-time diagnostics, there were many perceived barriers. These barriers included changes in timing and workflow, liability, documentation, ease of use, training time, device cost, and reimbursements by third-party payers.

These will need to be addressed before cervical screening and diagnostic programs can benefit from spectroscopy-based tools for cancer control.",0,0,
1379,Physician behavior in pediatric chronic disease care: relationship with health outcomes and adherence to treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: Physician behavior is an important but under-studied influence on child and parent adherence to medical treatment. METHOD: To address this need, research was reviewed in the following subject areas: child and adolescent perceptions of physicians' behavior in pediatric chronic disease management, parental perceptions of physicians' behavior in pediatric chronic disease management""; physicians' compliance with guidelines for pediatric chronic disease management; physicians' pediatric chronic disease management Information communication on chronic disease management; the relationship of physician behavior to adherence to treatment; and interventions to improve physicians' pediatric chronic disease management. CONCLUSIONS: Findings include inconsistencies between parent and adolescent needs and physician behavior, as well as adherence to practice guidelines that may limit children's adherence to medical treatment. However, the results of interventions designed by physicians to improve pediatric asthma management have been promising. Future research should be guided by a comprehensive model of physician behavior that takes into account contextual determinants (eg, culture and socioeconomic status) in chronic disease management, defines clinically relevant targets for intervention, and documents its impact on health outcomes. Chronic disease management approaches that involve physicians in active communication, support and decision-making processes with children with chronic diseases and their parents should be developed and evaluated.",0,0,
1380,Physician intervention and patient risk perception in smokers with acute respiratory disease in the emergency department,"BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Disease is responsible for more than 12 million visits to emergency departments in the United States each year. A quarter to half of these patients are smokers. We examined the frequency of physician intervention to quit smoking in patients with acute respiratory disease in the emergency department and the effect of physician intervention on patients' perceived risk from smoking and motivation to quit. METHODS: This study was conducted in the emergency department of a large hospital in the city centre. A questionnaire was applied to adult smokers (n = 63) who presented with symptoms of acute respiratory tract disease by conducting an exit interview while in the emergency room. The frequency and extent of physician interventions for smoking were examined using Health Care Policy and Research Agency guidelines as a Model. We also evaluated the patients' perceptions of risk from smoking, the presence of other smokers at home, and the patients' motivation to quit smoking. RESULTS: Emergency room doctors gave incomplete and inconsistent interventions to smoking. While most patients reported being asked if they smoked, only half of smokers were advised to quit. Only 9% were offered help with quitting. Risk perception was generally low, but most smokers were willing to receive onsite smoking cessation counseling while in the emergency room. CONCLUSIONS: The small sample size in this study requires careful interpretation of the results. However, the findings of this study suggest that the emergency room setting may provide a unique ""teachable moment"" for initiating smoking cessation counseling for this high-risk population.",0,0,
1381,Physician involvement in the management of obesity as a primary medical condition,"As the obesity epidemic escalates, an increasing number of patients present with serious comorbidities due to excess body weight. Obesity should be recognized and treated as a progressive, chronic and recurrent primary medical condition. Effective treatment of obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and comorbid conditions. Physician involvement is required for medical evaluation, management, counseling and coordination of multidisciplinary obesity treatment. Obese patients who receive counseling and weight management from doctors are much more likely to receive weight management programs than those who do not. Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from a variety of health care providers. A comprehensive weight management program should include dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and behavior change. Nutritional changes should take into account the energy content, composition and suitability of the diet for the individual patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical, including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily lifestyle activities. Various behavioral strategies enable the patient to make lifestyle changes that will promote weight loss and management. Additional treatments may serve to support lifestyle changes in cases of severe or resistant obesity. Multidisciplinary care models vary depending on whether they are designed for an individual medical practice or as part of a larger facility's healthcare. Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management should be permanently incorporated into the patient's daily lifestyle to reduce obesity and its associated health risks. Such an intervention is necessary to slow and reverse the growing obesity epidemic.",0,0,
1382,Physician management of hypercholesterolemia. A randomized trial of continuing medical education,"To determine the impact of continuing medical education (CME) on compliance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel's recommendations on high serum cholesterol levels in adults, we recruited primary care physicians in 174 practices, 2 standard or intensive CMEs, and a control group. The standard CME group received a free 3-hour seminar on high serum cholesterol levels”; the intensive CME group was provided with follow-up seminars and free office supplies. After 18 months, we audited 13,099 medical records from 140 practices.

1383,Physician reimbursement with salary or fee-for-service: impact on physician practice behavior in a randomized prospective study.,"We used an established continuity clinic to prospectively compare the impact of salary and pay-per-service reimbursement on physician practice behavior. This model allowed physicians to be randomized into salary and pay-per-service groups and to decouple the effects of reimbursement from patient behavior. Physicians reimbursed for service scheduled more visits per patient than salaried doctors (3.69 visits v 2.83 visits, less than P.01) and saw their patients more often (2.70 visits v 2.21 visits, less than P.05) 9 monthly work. Almost all of this difference was that paid doctors per service saw better patients than salaried doctors (1.42 visits and .99 visits per enrolled patient, respectively, less than P.01). Judging visits according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines showed that doctors who charge per service see more patients for better childcare than salaried doctors because they miss fewer recommended visits and scheduled visits that exceed these recommendations. Pay-per-service physicians also participate in a larger percentage of all visits by their patients (86.6% of visits and 78.3% of visits, less than P 0.05) and encourage less emergencies than salaried physicians. They provided good continuity of care. visits per registered patient (0.12 visits v 0.22 visits, P less than .01).

1385,Physician responses to a population-level study promoting reasonable antibiotic use,"OBJECTIVE: In an environment with multiple campaigns promoting rational antibiotic use in children, it is important to identify effective strategies. We evaluated physician responses to a population-level intervention for antibiotic prescribing, related practices, and perceived effectiveness. METHODS: This study was a mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of a randomized controlled population-wide educational intervention in 16 Massachusetts communities. Physicians in intervention communities received locally approved guidelines, group training sessions, and biweekly newsletters. Parents simultaneously received material in doctor's offices and by mail. After the intervention, we conducted a mailed physician questionnaire and individual interviews to assess the impact of the intervention. We compared survey responses for intervention and control physicians and analyzed interview transcripts to provide in-depth information on selected topics. RESULTS: Among respondents (n = 168), 91% of intervention and 4% of control physicians reported receiving intervention materials. Doctors took information from many other sources. More interventions than control physicians reported a decrease in antibiotic prescribing between 2000 and 2003 (75% versus 58%, P = .03), but there was no difference between groups in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors that support conscious antibiotic use. Both groups were concerned about antibiotic resistance and reported space to reduce their own prescriptions. Physicians interviewed recommended frequent repetition of messages, short written material on specific topics for themselves and their patients, and mass media promotion as the most effective strategies for reducing prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: In multiple communities, an intervention to promote judicious antibiotic prescribing in physicians' offices reached its intended audience, but physicians' self-reported attitudes and practices were similar in the intervention and control populations. Campaigns that repeat short, consistent reminders to multiple stakeholder groups may be most effective in ensuring reasonable antibiotic use.",0,0,
1386,Doctor screening for multiple behavioral health risk factors,"BACKGROUND: Screening rates for single behavioral health risk factors in primary care have been widely documented. However, such risk factors cluster in individuals and populations. This article examines the number and types of behavioral risk factors that U.S. adults report and have screened at their last routine medical exam. METHODS: The sample consisted of 16,818 adults who reported having routine checkups in the last year from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey. Participants completed questions on four behavioral risk factors (physical inactivity, overweight, smoking, risky drinking) and provider screening for behaviors related to these risk factors. RESULTS: Half of the sample (52.0%) reported having two or more of the four risk factors and more than half (59.4%) were screened for two or more risky behaviors during their last routine check-up, but 28.6% reported being screened. none. Participants who reported at least one risk factor were screened for an average of 57.7% of their own risk factors. Women, adults with lower income and education levels, and people 65 and older reported being screened for fewer risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: While guidelines for risk factor screening and intervention typically focus on single behavioral risk factors, most primary care patients have more than one and are screened for them. Behavioral risk factor screening tools and interventions should be expanded to include multiple risks. Additionally, efforts are needed to reduce significant missed opportunities for screening and to eliminate demographic differences in screening practices and accuracy.",0,0,
1387,"Physician, heal yourself: health protection behaviors among physicians","The purpose of this article is to evaluate the need for health care intervention programs for physicians and patients. We compared physicians' (as patients) adherence to health-preserving behavior with a control patient population. An online questionnaire was sent to Texas Tech University Health Science Center (TTUHSC) medical school clinical and non-clinical basic science faculties and non-TTUHSC clinicians of the local county medical community. The questionnaire included questions about basic demographics and recent participation in regular health care strategies, including annual checkups, flu shots, colonoscopy, Pap smears, and mammograms. Logistic regressions were performed to determine whether being a physician was significantly associated with the probability of participating in the health-maintaining behavior outcomes listed above. This article shows that physicians are less likely than the general population to follow certain health care guidelines (i.e. annual checkups, colonoscopies, and mammograms). Pap smear rates did not differ between physicians and the control population, but physicians did show an increased likelihood of receiving influenza vaccine.",0,0,
1388,Physician-Industry Relations. Part 1: Individual Doctors,"This is part 1 of a 2-part article on ethics and physician-industry relationships. Part 1 offers advice to individual doctors"";"" Part 2 provides advice to medical education providers and the medical professional community. Physicians and industry have a common interest in advancing medical knowledge. However, the primary ethics of the physician is to promote the interests of the patient, while the primary ethics of the industry is to promote profitability. While partnerships between physicians and industry can lead to impressive medical advances, they also create opportunities for bias and cause negative public perceptions. Many physicians and trained physicians feel that they are not affected by the commercial influence. However, recent research shows that industry hospitality and accepting gifts, even drug samples, can compromise judgments about medical information and subsequent decisions about patient care. It is up to the physician to decide whether a gift is acceptable. A very general principle is that it is ethical to accept modest gifts that enhance medical practice. It is clearly unethical to accept gifts or services that compel the physician to reciprocate. Conflicts of interest may arise from other financial ties between physicians and industry, from outside companies or from self-owned businesses. Such ties include talking or writing about a company's product, paying for participation in clinical-based research, and referrals to medical resources. All these relationships have the potential to affect the attitudes and practices of the physician. This article explores relevant ethical dilemmas and provides guidelines for ethical business dealings.",0,0,

The aim of this study is to determine the relationship of physicians' personal habits with their attitudes and behaviors towards JNC VII lifestyle change guidelines. METHODS: One thousand primary care physicians completed DocStyles 2010, a voluntary web-based questionnaire designed to provide information on physicians' attitudes and behaviors related to a variety of health problems. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 45.3, and 68% were male. Regarding physician behavior, 4.0% smoke at least once a week, 38.6% consume >/=5 cups of fruit and/or vegetables >/=5 days/week and 27.4% >/=5 days/ He was exercising for the week. When asked about the specific types of advice offered to their hypertensive patients, physicians replied that they recommend a healthy diet (92.2%) or reducing salt (96.1%) or reaching a healthy weight (94.8%). or limiting alcohol use (75.4%) or being physically active (94.4%). Collectively, 66.5% made all 5 lifestyle change recommendations. Doctors who did not smoke were more likely to recommend each lifestyle intervention to their hypertensive patients.

1391,Doctors' response to victims of domestic violence: towards a model of care,"Existing domestic violence guidelines, such as those published by the AMA in 1992, continue to invite doctors to play a large role in identifying, intervening and monitoring, although they seek to relieve doctors of ""the entire burden of intervention."" in case of partner abuse. In this paper, we describe a limited domestic violence role for physicians who take the direction suggested by the AMA and complete sample programs. We propose to simplify and limit the role of physicians to ""asking patients about abuse""; providing affirmative messages, admitting the beating is wrong and reaffirming the patient's value; documenting signs, symptoms, and explanations; and referring victims to domestic violence specialists (AVDRs) to the literature and our own experience. Based on these four missions, we show how the focus on the role of the doctor in these four tasks is consistent with the sample programs and expands the ideas of experts to address domestic violence in health care, reducing barriers to the intervention of doctors for victims; reducing unrealistic training demands for doctors by providing a realistic approach; "" and complements managed care trends in contemporary health care.",0,0,
1392,Physicians understand consent requirements for phase I clinical trials in cognitively impaired or highly vulnerable populations,"We investigated physicians' attitudes towards including patients who were unable to give informed consent or who were from a vulnerable population in clinical trials. A survey tool asked a nationwide sample of GPs whether ten hypothetical patients could be enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The impact of demographic variables on the number of scenarios considered fully or partially acceptable was analyzed via student T-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) as applicable. All significant (p<0.01) variables were entered into the multiple logistic regression model. Eighty-four percent of respondents said at least one case scenario is acceptable. The majority of those conducting clinical trials (62%), those trained in clinical research ethics (78%), and those on institutional review boards (IRBs) (83%) approved at least one case scenario. Physicians have approved the inclusion of some patients in clinical trials who were unable to give informed consent or were from a vulnerable population. More effective education should be provided for GPs, residents and medical students on guidelines involving clinical research. There should also be assurance that physicians conducting clinical trials or participating in IRBs have the necessary knowledge of clinical research ethics.",0,0,

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients at risk for cardiovascular events who might benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were identified from electronic data in a managed care organization and randomly assigned to 2 groups. Physicians seeing outpatients in the intervention group were faxed a page with pertinent patient data, including a recommendation to prescribe the prescribed medication. In the control group, the datasheet did not include the recommendation. Distributed prescriptions were compared between groups. RESULTS: More than 4000 visits were observed for each drug type. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers were dispensed after the first patient-physician encounter in 7.1% of visits in the intervention group and 5.7% in the control group (P = .048). No significant difference was observed for statins (intervention, 8.1% vs control, 7.7%). Data for all patient-physician encounters and for both drugs were combined in a logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was 1.19 for a prescription given in the intervention group and 1.54 for 1 visit versus 2 or more visits. RESULTS: An automated system that provides relevant data and tailored recommendations for point-of-service care has modestly increased prescription dispensing rates.

Information systems with point-of-care electronic alerts (POCEPs) can facilitate process adoption and performance comparison. We evaluated the efficacy of POCEPs on antibiotic administration rates within 60 minutes after surgical incision and outcome in a prospective observational study. METHODS: SCIP 1 compliance and the associated outcome variable (surgical site infection [SSI]) were prospectively studied over 2 consecutive 6-month periods before (A) and (B) after administration of POCEPs in a regional health system. The secondary analysis extended the observation to two 12-month periods (A' and B'). This was followed by a 2-year (C and D) sustainability phase. RESULTS: 19,744 procedures included 9127 and 10,617 procedures before (A) and (B) after administration of POCEPs, respectively. POCEPs increased compliance with SCIP indicators by 31% (95% CI, 30.0%-32.2%) in period B from 62% to 92% (average SSI rates for all periods were lower compared to pre-POCEP SSI rates (0.8). the lower P 95%, 0.7% and 0.5% vs 1.1%"";"" was associated with an absolute risk reduction of 30% and 0.4% incidence of SSI.

1396,"Population-based interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection","AIM: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred in 1999. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that by December 1999, more than 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV lived in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). STI and HIV epidemics are linked. Similar behaviors, such as frequent unprotected sex with different partners, put people at increased risk for both infections, and there is clear evidence that traditional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have shown a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is also biological evidence that the presence of an STI increases HIV transmission and that STI treatment reduces HIV transmission (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute significantly to HIV prevention. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on HIV infection frequency, STI frequency, and quality of STI management. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized trials or reviews: 1) MEDLINE using the search terms ""sexually transmitted diseases"" and ""human immunodeficiency virus infection"" for the years 1966 to 2003 2) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Abstracts of Efficacy Reviews Database and Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, latest issue of The Cochrane Library 3) Expert register of research maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group. 4) EMBASE Abstracts of relevant conferences were searched and lists of all reference review articles and primary studies were searched.

The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers using the Cochrane Infectious Diseases standard guidelines, recording details of the randomization method, blinding, use of therapeutic analysis, and the number of patients lost to follow-up. Group. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment for STIs of all community members, the HIV infection case rate rate was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (enhanced syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared to 1.9% (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.42-0.70) in the control groups. 38% reduction in HIV incidence in the intervention group (95%CI 15% to 55%). In the most recent study by Kamali et al., the odds ratio for behavioral intervention and STI management compared to control over HIV incidence was 1.00 (0.63–1.58, p=.98). These are consistent with Rakai data showing no effect of the intervention. Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there were no significant reductions in gonorrhea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among the intervention populations. In Rakai, the prevalence rate for syphilis was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71-0.89), trichmoniasis 0.59 (0.38-0.91) and bacterial vaginosis 0.87 (0.74-1.02) between the intervention and control groups.

Similarly, only 15% and 16% of SSP visits, respectively, were any recommended medication. However, SSPs who visited intervention pharmacies were more likely to receive training and counseling (27% versus 40%, p=0.01). No partner cards or condoms were issued to any SSP.

None of the four studies had strong evidence of any effect on treatment-seeking behavior, service use, or sexual behavior. RESULTS OF STUDY: There is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce the incidence of HIV in an environment characterized by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly increasing prevalence) where STI treatment services are poor and STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence that all community members benefit significantly from their treatment. Adding the Kamali case to the available evidence supports the ineffectiveness of the data from the Rakai case. However, there are other compelling reasons to strengthen STI treatment services, and available evidence suggests that once an intervention is adopted, it can significantly improve the quality of services provided. The Kamali trial shows an increase in condom use, a marker for improved risk behaviors. More population-based randomized controlled trials testing a range of alternative STI control strategies in a variety of different settings are needed. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors, including HIV, STI, and other biological endpoints, as well as health-seeking behavior and quality of treatment.",0,0,

Intervention strategies are activities or changes aimed at promoting healthy behavior in children. These include (a) systematic reviews; (b) recommendations, guidelines, or standards based on evidence and expert consensus from non-governmental or federal agencies; and finally (c) peer-reviewed synthesis reviews. Intervention examples show how at least one of the strategies was used in a particular setting. To identify examples of interventions, we evaluated (a) peer-reviewed literature as well as (b) additional sources with research-tested and practice-based initiatives. Researchers and practitioners can use this review to find examples of research and practice-tested interventions that can be replicated in their own communities when setting priorities and promoting integration across settings and for the prevention of childhood obesity.",0,0,
1399,Positron emission tomography in gynecological cancer,"Most positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in gynecological cancer are performed using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). It provides valuable information in the primary staging of untreated advanced cervical cancer, in surveillance after treatment with an unexplained tumor marker (such as squamous cell carcinoma antigen [SCC-Ag]), or in the restaging of potentially treatable recurrent cervical cancer with suspicion of recurrence. . Its value in early stage resectable cervical cancer is controversial. In ovarian cancer with FDG-PET, plateau or increased abnormal serum CA 125 (>35 U/mL), localized recurrence identified by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (CT-MRI) and applicable for locally destructive procedures (e.g. surgical , radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation) and clinically suspected recurrent or persistent cancer that cannot be biopsied under CT guidance. The role of FDG-PET in endometrial cancer is relatively less defined in the literature due to lack of data. In our prospective study, FDG-PET combined with MRI-CT may facilitate optimal management of endometrial cancer in well-selected cases. The clinical effect was positive in 29 (48.3%) of the 60 scans, 22.2% for primary staging, 73.1% for post-treatment surveillance, and 57.1% after rescue therapy, respectively. Insufficient studies have been reported in the treatment of vulvar cancer using FDG-PET. More data is needed. Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia is quite unique in terms of biological behavior and clinical management. Our preliminary results suggest that FDG-PET is potentially useful in selected gestational trophoblastic neoplasms by providing a presensitive metastatic mapping of tumor extent, monitoring response, and localizing viable tumors after chemotherapy.

DESIGN Epidemiological modeling study. AYAR Health economics data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, the Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey, the Office for National Statistics, and other published studies PARTICIPANTS stratified by one-fifth socioeconomic status â€°Â¥25-year-old adults. INTERVENTIONS Complete ban of trans fatty acids in processed foods""; improved labeling of trans fatty acids; ban of trans fatty acids in restaurants and takeaways. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Deaths from coronary heart disease have been prevented or delayed; life years gained; quality-adjusted life years. Government and industry policy costs; policy savings directly resulting from reductions in healthcare, informal care and lost productivity. CONCLUSIONS A total ban of trans fatty acids in processed foods could prevent or delay approximately 7200 deaths (2.6%) from coronary heart disease between 2015-20 and reduce the disparity in deaths from coronary heart disease by approximately 3000 deaths (15%). Policies to improve labeling or simply remove trans fatty acids from restaurants/fast food could save 1800 (0.7%) and 3500 (1.3%) deaths from coronary heart disease, and reduce inequalities from 600 (3%) to 1500 (7%) deaths. rate can be reduced. , thus making them half as effective at best. The total ban would have the largest net cost savings of around £265m ($361m, $415m) excluding reformulation costs, or £64m if significant reformulation costs occur outside the normal cycle. CONCLUSIONS A regulatory policy in the UK to eliminate trans fatty acids from processed foods would be the most effective and fair policy option. Interim policies would also be helpful. However, continuing to rely on industry to voluntarily reformulate products can have negative health and economic consequences.",0,0,
1403,Practical clinical trials in psychopharmacology: a systematic review,"Practical clinical trials (PCTs) are randomized trials under typical practice conditions to test the ""real-life"" benefits and risks of therapeutic interventions. Effective PCTs have been performed in cardiology, oncology, and internal medicine. Psychotropic drugs are widely and increasingly used in medical practice. This review reviews recent advances in the conduct of PCTs in psychopharmacology. January 2000 - October 2014 The MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications of PCTs with at least 100 subjects per treatment arm. Most PCTs in psychiatry evaluated mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapy. Of the 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase during the observation period. Sample size 200 to 18.154"";"" only 11 studies randomized 500 or more patients. Psychopharmacology PCTs were equally likely to be funded by industry as well as public institutions. There were 10 PCT antidepressants for a total of 4206 patients (compared to at least 46 PCTs of antihypertensive drugs for a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs have used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as the primary outcome and have produced efficacy and safety data that influence both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Practical clinical research can be an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators and policy makers, but has been used relatively less in psychopharmacology. Electronic medical records and integrated application research networks offer promising platforms for more efficient execution of PCTs.",0,0,

To standardize and improve the care provided to family members of these veterans, health care researchers partnered with program leaders and rehabilitation professionals to implement the collaboration to improve family quality of care. OBJECTIVE: To identify practice changes associated with the intervention of the Family Care Collaborative. DESIGN: Cross-site, mixed method evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: Rehabilitation interdisciplinary team members (n = 226) working at four participating facilities. INTERVENTIONS: Collaboratively developed and implemented a 6-month pilot, a web-based tool to standardize and promote family-centered care. RESULTS: Survey of provider perceived efficacy in family care, satisfaction with family care, and working with families""; specific practice changes at each site; provider and facilitator perceptions of collaboration; and a validated measure to predict the probability of success of the chosen intervention. KEY RESULTS: Family-centered practices and satisfaction improved at sites with lower baseline scores (P < 0.05) and were equivalent across sites after piloting. Providers initiated specific family-centered practices that usually started at one site and spread to others through collaboration. The sites standardized family education and collaboration. Providers, believed that collaboration had produced a ""culture shift"" from patient-centred to family-centered care, and saw the involvement of program leadership and health care researchers as crucial to success. The scores of n measures were promising.

1407,Implementation Isn't Always Perfect: A Qualitative Study Explaining Why a Training Toolkit Trial Didn't Improve Quality of Care,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is a chronic disease commonly managed by family physicians, the most common complication of which is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in the care of diabetic patients. We conducted a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a printed educational toolkit aimed at improving CVD management in diabetes in primary care and found no effect and indeed a possibility of harm. We conducted a qualitative assessment to examine the guideline implementation strategy used in this trial and to understand its implications. This article focuses solely on qualitative findings, as the quantitative results of RCT have already been reported elsewhere. METHODS AND RESULTS: All family practices in the province of Ontario were randomly selected to receive the training toolkit in the summer of 2009 (intervention arm) or spring 2010 (control arm). A subset of 80 family physicians (representing approximately 10% of randomized and approached practices, with enrollment of 1,592 randomly selected patients with diabetes at high risk for CVD) then participated in a chart review and reflective feedback exercise on their practice versus guideline recommendations. They were asked to fill out two forms (one pre-audit and one post-audit) to understand their awareness of pre-trial guidelines, their expectations of their individual performance before the audit, and their reflection on the audit results. In addition, individual interviews were conducted with thirteen other family physicians. Textual data from interview transcripts and written comments from pre- and post-audit forms were subjected to qualitative descriptive analysis to identify common themes and patterns. The analysis revealed four main themes: impressions of the toolset, awareness was not the problem, 'not my patient', and chart control as a more effective intervention than the toolkit. Participants found neither the toolkit content nor the dissemination strategy effective, indicating that they felt they were aware of the pre-trial guidelines. However, their accounts also noted that they may have a hard time prioritizing CVD management amid competing demands for their attention. After receiving the chart inspection results, many respondents expressed surprise that they had not performed better. They reported that the audit results would be an important motivation for behavior change. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative findings summarized in this paper provide important insights into why the intervention was not effective. They also show that physicians have undetected needs for CVD management and that schedule control serves to identify hitherto unawareness in their practice. The findings also indicate that new intervention development and delivery methods need to be explored. This is important given the high prevalence of diabetes worldwide"";"" Appropriate CVD management is critical to addressing disease-related morbidity and mortality.",0,0,

The utility of Planned Behavior Theory (TPB) has not previously been explored in explaining this variance in community nursing. OBJECTIVE: This article reports a study whose primary aim was to examine the utility of TPB in explaining differences in nurses' intention to offer smoking cessation advice in accordance with coronary heart disease guidelines. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using the postal questionnaire. A 52-item questionnaire was administered to 48 practice nurses in England. The questionnaire was designed to assess components of TPB and included intentions to offer smoking cessation advice, person-reported past behaviors, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral controls (PBCs), behavioral beliefs and evaluations, normative beliefs, and motivation. conforming to and controlling beliefs and judgments. RESULTS: TPB explained up to 40% of the variance in intentions to offer smoking cessation advice. Attitudes and PBCs were the most important predictors of intention. Among other elements of TPB, implicit attitudes and indirect PBCs made significant positive contributions to explaining the variance in intent. DISCUSSION: Future trials of interventions to increase practice nurses' compliance with clinical guidelines may seek to address the elements identified in this study as important factors. More studies are needed to examine the utility of TPB in predicting the behavior of practice nurses.",0,0,

American Academy of Sleep Medicine Standards of Practice Committee,"Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint reported to doctors. Treatment traditionally includes medication. Behavioral approaches have been available for decades, but lack of physician awareness and education, difficulty in obtaining reimbursement, and questions about effectiveness have limited their use. These practice parameters review the available evidence for various non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia. The available literature was analyzed using a supplementary article providing a background review. Evidence was graded according to previously reported criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, with reference to the criteria of the American Psychological Association. Treatments considered include: stimulus control, progressive muscle relaxation, paradoxical intent, biofeedback, sleep restriction, multicomponent cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene training, imagery training, and cognitive therapy. The improved experimental design has significantly advanced the evaluation process of non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia using guidelines outlined by the American Psychological Association (APA). Recommendations for individual therapies using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendation levels for each are: Stimulus Control (Standard)""; Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Paradoxical Intention, and Biological Feedback (Guidelines); Sleep Restriction and Multicomponent Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Options);"" Sleep Hygiene Training, Imagery Training, and Cognitive Therapy lacked sufficient evidence to be recommended as single treatments.

1412,Implementation-level effects of interventions to improve asthma care in primary care: Pediatric Asthma Care Patient Outcomes Research Team.,"Aim. To evaluate the effects of (1) a physician peer leader intervention and (2) peer leaders at the practice level, with the introduction of asthma education nurses to facilitate improvement of care. And to compare the findings with previously reported patient-level results from study enrollees. Working Setting. Data on children aged 5-17 years with asthma in 40 primary care settings enrolled in the Pediatric Asthma Care Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) randomized trial connected to managed health care plans were included. Study design. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to one of the two care improvement arms or routine care. Automated damage data were analyzed for 12-month periods using a repeated section design. The primary outcome was evidence of at least one controller drug distributed among patients with persistent asthma. Secondary outcomes included controller distribution among all identified asthmatics, evidence of chronic controller use, and administration of oral steroids. Healthcare use outcomes included the number of outpatient visits and hospital-based events. Key Findings. The proportion of children with permanent asthma prescription controllers increased in all study arms. No effect of interventions was detected on the proportion of controllers receiving (peer leader intervention effect 0.01, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: -0.07, 0.08"";"" planned care intervention effect -0.03, 95 percent CI: -0.09, 0.02). A statistical trend was seen towards an increased number of bursts of oral corticosteroids deployed in intervention practices. Significant adjusted increases in outpatient visits were seen in the first year of intervention, 0.08-0.10 visits per year for each child, but only a statistical trend in these outcomes persisted in the second year of follow-up. No differences were detected in hospital-based events. Results. This analysis showed a slight increase in outpatient asthma visits as a result of asthma care improvement interventions using automated data. The absence of a detectable effect on drug use at the practice level differs from the positive intervention effect observed in self-reported data from trial enrollees. Analysis of automated data on unregistered adds information on the impact of maintenance improvement strategies at the application level. The benefits of practice-level interventions may accrue disproportionately to a subset of research participants. The impact of such interventions may be less pronounced at the level of practices or health plans.",0,1,

1414,Pre-commitment to choosing wisely about low-value services: a staggered wedge-set randomized trial.,"Background Little is known about how to deter clinicians from ordering low-value services. Our goal was to test whether clinicians could potentially reduce low-value orders to follow their future selves (i.e., pre-committed) decision support along with Choose Wisely recommendations. Methods We conducted a 12-month staggered wedge cluster randomized trial among 45 primary care physicians and advanced practice providers in six adult primary care clinics of a US community group practice. Clinicians were invited to make a prior commitment to Choose Wise Recommendations against imaging for uncomplicated low back pain. , imaging for uncomplicated headaches and unnecessary antibiotics for acute sinusitis. Pre-committed clinicians received weekly emails with 1-6 month point-of-care pre-commitment reminders, as well as patient education brochures and resources to support communication about low-value services. The primary outcome was the difference between the control and intervention percentages of patients. visits with potentially low value orders. Secondary outcomes are the differences between the control and intervention period percentages of visits with possible alternative orders, and the differences in the control and post-intervention 3-month follow-up percentages of visits with potentially low value orders. Results Intervention was not associated with a change in the percentage of visits with potentially low-value orders overall for headaches or acute sinusitis, but was associated with an overall 1.7% increase in alternative orders (p=0.01). For low back pain, the intervention was associated with a 1.2% decrease in the percentage of visits with potentially low value orders (p=0.001) and a 1.9% increase in the percentage of visits with alternative orders (p=0.007). There was no change in follow-up. Conclusion Clinician's pre-commitment to Choose Wisely recommendations was associated with a small, unsustained decline in potentially low-value orders for only one of the three targeted conditions, and there may be an increase in alternative orders.",1,1,

OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between service providers' behavioral intentions and compliance with practice guidelines""; to assess the impact of perceived barriers that most inhibit compliance; and to examine the ability of factors in the Physician's Guideline Compliance Model to predict adherence intention and compliance with guidelines applied at specific practice sites. METHODS: Predecessors (attitudes) Survey research methods were used to assess the effects of providers (subjective norms, past behavior, and perceived behavioral control) on providers' intention to comply with clinical practice guidelines Provider survey I was conducted at the time of guideline introduction and survey II 4 months after administration. scores reflected positive responses to the use of guidelines. Self-reported mean compliance behavior was 65%, while compliance as assessed by chart review was 54%. The variance in physicians' behavioral intentions was approx. 68 of them are explained by the variables included in the Physician Guide Adherence Model. A significant negative relationship was found between perceived barriers and self-reported behavior, but not between perceived barriers and behavior assessed by chart review. RESULTS: Some variables, particularly perceived barriers to guideline enforcement, predicted a provider's enforcement intentions and self-reported behavior. Future guideline response efforts should identify and reduce these barriers to guideline compliance prior to implementation.",0,0,

DESIGN Prospective open cohort study using data routinely collected from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and 176 individual practices to validate the score. PARTICIPANTS 2,540 753 patients aged 25-79 in the derivation cohort, contributed to 16 436 135 person-years of observation, and 78 081 had a case diagnosis of type 2 diabetes""; confirmation cohort with 37 535 cases of type 2 diabetes OUTCOME MEASURES Risk in the derivation cohort In the final model, self-assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend withdrawal score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current corticosteroid use; outcome of interest was event diabetes recorded in the general practice registry. Calibration and discrimination measures were calculated in the validation cohort. RESULTS There was a four- to five-fold variation in the risk of type 2 diabetes among different ethnic groups. Compared with the white reference group, adjusted hazard rate 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.2) for Bangladeshi women 4 to 5.11), 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) and 2.54 (2.20) for Pakistani women. For Pakistani men up to 2.93. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had an increased risk compared to the corresponding white reference group. In the validation dataset, the model explained 51.53 percent of the variation (95% confidence interval 50.90 to 52.16) for females and 48.16% (47.52 to 48.80) for males. The risk score differed well, with a D statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) for women and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) for men. The model is well calibrated.

SUBJECTS 1414 Women over the age of 69, standing in private or locally authorized residential or geriatric care. Those who had bilateral hip surgery were excluded from the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Broadband ultrasonic attenuation (BUA) index, Clifton assessment procedures for aging testing (for cognition) and mobility on a six-point scale, and hip fracture over the next two-year period. RESULTS 73 Women broke their hips within two years. Mean age was not significantly different from women without fracture (85.3 (SD 5.6) v 83.9 (6.3)""; p = 0.07), but mean BUA index (40.3 (19.3) v 50.9 (22.2) ) db/MH2 ) and grip score (median 19 (interquartile range 10.5-27.0) v 24 (17-30)) were significantly lower (both p less than 0.001). These variables had independent associations with hip fracture. Women with fractures had a significantly lower score for the psychomotor component of the cognitive test (4.5 (1-8) v 7 (2-10); p was less than 0.0025 and was significantly more mobile (1(1-3) v 3 ( 1-6); p less than 0.02). When we subdivided women according to high, moderate, and low scores for the BUA index and awareness testing, the high-risk group (118 women) with a low BUA index and awareness score emerged, and the fracture incidence was : 12.8%;"" the incidence of fracture in the lowest risk group (136 women) with a high BUA index and cognitive score was only 1.5% (relative risk 8.4 (95% confidence) range -2.0 to 35.5]. Further analysis showed that those most at risk were, in addition, the most mobile, but women who were less active had a low incidence of fractures independent of the BUA index (1.2%, high index, v 0.9%, low index). CONCLUSIONS Older women most at risk of hip fractures are those with a low BUA index, low cognitive test score, and high mobility. Improving bone strength and awareness in older women can reduce the incidence of hip fractures.",0,0,

DESIGN: Descriptive, exploratory, secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient oncology patients in a city in the midwest USA. EXAMPLE: 96 women aged 29-83 years, 72% married, 95% white, diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer, receiving adjuvant anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. METHODS: Participants were randomized to either a behavioral sleep intervention group or an attention control group. Participants completed data collection before and during the peak and recovery days of the first chemotherapy treatment cycle and after the last treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, circadian rhythms of activity, objective and subjective sleep-wake, and objective and subjective activity-rest. RESULTS: Predictors of fatigue were less total sleep time before treatment, higher fatigue before treatment and at peak, and less energy upon waking on recovery days. In the control group, predictors of higher fatigue were higher fatigue before treatment, higher body mass index, higher positive lymph node count, and less daytime dysfunction. For the intervention group, lower peak activity at the peak of initial treatment differently predicted fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that sleep intervention group participants who maintained balanced activity with sleep at the peak of initial treatment benefited most from the intervention. PRACTICES FOR NURSING: Nurses should screen for fatigue prior to initial chemotherapy treatment and at regular intervals, further evaluate poor sleep in patients reporting 4 or greater (on a 0-10 scale) fatigue, and use evidence-based guidelines for selection. appropriate interventions.",0,0,
1420,Predictors of provider recommendation for HPV vaccine among young adult men and women: findings from a cross-sectional survey.,"Background: Although doctor's recommendation is one of the strongest predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, it is unclear to whom doctors recommend the vaccine. To guide intervention efforts, this study investigated predictors of participant-reported physician recommendation for HPV vaccination among young adults in the United States. METHODS: Men and women aged 18-26 (N=223) were recruited online through Craigslist, a popular classified ads website. From September 2013 to March 2014, classifieds were published in the 25 largest cities in the USA. Participants completed a questionnaire that evaluated demographic and sociopolitical characteristics, sexual history, HPV vaccination history, and whether they had received HPV vaccination recommendations from a doctor or healthcare provider. Provider. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent reported receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccine and 45% reported receiving >/=1 dose of HPV vaccine. Participants who received advice were more than 35 times more likely to receive >/=1 dose of HPV vaccine than participants who did not receive advice. Bivariate and multivariate correlations of the provider recommendation were determined. Results from the multivariate model showed that younger (18-21 years), female, and White participants with health insurance (i.e., another type such as employer-sponsored or military-sponsored) were more likely to report receiving a recommendation for HPV vaccination. . CONCLUSIONS: The results show that physician recommendation practices for HPV vaccine vary according to patient characteristics. The findings highlight the key role of the healthcare provider in promoting HPV vaccination and have important implications for future HPV vaccine interventions with young adults.",0,0,

1422,Prescribing habits of GPs in choosing an empirical antibiotic regimen for lower respiratory tract infections in adults in Sicily,"The survey was conducted between September 1995 and May 1996 to define prescriptive behavior among Sicilian general practitioners (GPs) when choosing an empirical antibiotic regimen for LRTIs in adult patients and to begin an educational process involving the same GPs in decisions. when following prescriptions and local guidelines. Each GP completed a questionnaire that ended with an antibiotic prescription for each therapeutic intervention. In the questionnaire, the characteristics of the patient, the diseases to be treated and drug prescription were also questioned. In order to evaluate the prescriptive behavior of the physicians regarding the patient's symptoms, the opinion of the physicians was sought about the severity assessment of the infectious disease before choosing the antibiotic treatment. Of all the upcoming Sicilian practitioners, 76 doctors from 25 Sicilian towns with a patient population of 96,630 agreed to participate. The doctors used 49 different molecules and six different combinations of the two antibiotics. The most commonly used antibacterial agents were cephalosporins (55.0%). Penicillins (11.7%), fluoroquinolones (11.4%), macrolides (10.1%), and penicillin combinations together with beta-lactamase inhibitors (7.9%) represented 41.1% of the remaining antibiotic prescriptions. The choice of route of administration was significantly influenced by the age of the patients, the symptoms and signs of the disease, and the presence of concomitant diseases rather than the bacteria suspected of causing the disease. The highly marked variation in the pattern of prescribing antibiotics for LRTIs among Sicilian GPs reflects the lack or lack of knowledge of any local or national guidelines on the management of these diseases.",0,0,
1423,Prescription data as a tool in pharmacotherapy supervision (I). General Evaluations,"This article discusses how prescription data available from pharmacies can be used as a tool to support improving prescribing behavior. For optimal use of prescription data in pharmacotherapeutic supervision, the specific purpose of the audit meeting should be clear. Appropriate measures (quality, volume, cost of drug selection) should then be selected for the presentation and discussion of prescribing. Recommendations for adequate measures are given for the various purposes of audit meetings. For each stage of behavior change, the article explains why and how prescription data can make a useful contribution. Finally, recommendations on prerequisites for optimal use of prescription data are given. Important factors are that prescribing data adequately covers the patient population of physicians, information on the extent of represcribing is needed, and prescribing drugs for multiple indications can cause difficulties in interpreting charts. With this information in mind, prescribing feedback can be tailored to the needs of the control groups and targeted to the intervention followed.",0,0,
1424,Post-Occupational Exposure HIV Prophylaxis Prescription by Emergency Physicians: An Analysis on Prescription Accuracy and Compliance,"We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective nPEP (Non-Occupational Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) registry based on patients consulted in an academic Emergency department located in Brussels, Belgium. Here we review 1,357 cases consulted from January 2011 to December 2013. The aim of the study is to determine whether emergency room physicians prescribe nPEP according to national guideline with support from IDS (infectious disease specialists). Because this intervention has a high cost, we wanted to confirm that treatment was properly allocated to high-risk patients. We also wanted to determine whether adherence to nPEP when prescribed by the Emergency Physician differs from literature reports. Finally, we wanted to explain the population counseling for nPEP in our center. Emergency physicians prescribed nPEP more frequently at high-risk exposures (98.6%) than at moderate-risk exposures (53.2%)"";"" adequate allocation of resources from a public health perspective. When nPEP was evaluated according to Belgian guidelines, prescription compliance was 98.8%. In our study, compliance with nPEP prescribed by emergency physicians was 60%. Compliance was highest in MSM (Men Who Have Sex With Men), while victims of sexual assault showed the lowest compliance. Altogether, this study demonstrates that ED physicians can safely and adequately prescribe nPEP when supported by comprehensive guidelines. Recognizing the intrinsic differences within heterogeneous populations consulted for nPEP may improve adherence to this costly public health intervention.",0,0,
1425,Prescription omega-3s: an overview for nurse practitioners,"Nurse practitioners (NPs) often take a multidisciplinary approach when treating and educating patients. Collaboration with a registered dietitian is not uncommon when treating patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides [TGs] >/=500 mg/dL). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia should be treated and managed to normalize TG levels (TG level <150 mg/dL). Treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia is usually 3-fold, including lifestyle changes, dietary modification, and pharmacotherapy. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are often the first step in lowering TG levels. Registered dietitians encourage a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. There is growing evidence to support the consumption of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to reduce TGs. When lifestyle and dietary changes do not effectively lower TGs, NPs will recommend pharmacological therapy as the next step. A viable pharmacological option includes prescription omega-3 (P-OM3) fatty acid ethyl esters. Each 4 g/day dose of P-OM3 provides 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid. Clinical trials show that P-OM3 can safely and effectively reduce TGs by 45% in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Nurse practitioners play an important role in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia and in educating patients about lifestyle and dietary changes that can greatly affect patients' health.",0,0,

Prevention is focused on the detection and removal of polypoid neoplasms. Data on the significance of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms (NP-CRNs) are limited. Objectives To determine the prevalence of NP-CRNs in the Gazi hospital population and to characterize their association with colorectal cancer. Design, Environment, and Patients Cross-sectional study at a California veterans hospital with 1819 patients undergoing elective colonoscopy between July 2003 and June 2004. Main Outcome Measures Endoscopic appearance, location, size, histology, and depth of invasion of neoplasms. Results The overall prevalence of NP-CRNs was 9.35% (95% CI [95% CI], 8.05-10.78""; n=170).

1430,"Prevalence of War-Related Mental Health Conditions and Relation to Displacement Status in the Post-War Jaffna Region, Sri Lanka","Context Around 2.7 million people worldwide are internally displaced each year (taking refuge in their home country's safe zones) as a result of armed conflict. Although the psychological impact of war is well documented, less is known about the mental health symptoms of forced displacement among internally displaced persons. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of the most common war-related mental health conditions, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms in the post-war Jaffna District of Sri Lanka, and to evaluate the relationship between displacement and these conditions. Design, Environment and Participants Between July and September 2009, a cross-sectional multistage cluster sample survey was conducted among 1517 Jaffna District households that included 2 IDP camps. The response rate was 92% (1448 participants, 1409 eligible participants). Two percent (n = 80) of respondents were already displaced, 29.5% (n = 539) were recently resettled, and 68.5% (n = 790) were long-term residents. Bivariate analyzes followed by multivariate logistic regression models were performed to determine the relationship between displacement status and mental health.

1431,Prevention and management of amateurism in medical faculties,"Professionalism is a required competency for medical students, residents, GPs, and academic faculty. Faculty members must adhere to a code of conduct or risk discipline. The authors describe unprofessional issues in academic medicine that result in the filing of complaints or allegations of faculty malpractice, and outline strategies for early intervention and prevention. Writers, vice deans and assistant deans, and the executive director of the office of faculty affairs at a major U.S. medical school have handled many allegations of unprofessional behavior over the past decade. They provide case examples of behavior such as disrespect, inappropriate language and behavior, non-cooperation with healthcare team members, and sexual harassment/discrimination. They discuss factors that make these behaviors difficult to assess, including varying definitions of respect, different cultural norms, and false claims. The authors provide recommendations for prevention and intervention, including early detection, performance management, education about sexual harassment, and referrals to professional coaches, anger management classes, and faculty staff assistance programs.",0,0,
1432,Caries prevention in young children of Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York: perspectives of mothers and pediatricians,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood caries is common in South Asian immigrant families. Few children go to the dentist at 12 months of age, as current guidelines recommend. The pediatric visit has significant potential to connect children to preventive care. The aim of this study was to understand the barriers and facilitators of caries prevention for young children of Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York. Qualitative data were collected as a preliminary step in the development of an oral health counseling intervention for South Asian children. BASIC DESIGN: Qualitative interviews were conducted with Bangladeshi mothers on child nutrition and prevention of oral health. Qualitative interviews were conducted with pediatricians about their caregiving experience. Data were analyzed using standard qualitative approaches. SETTING: Pediatric practices serving low-income Bangladeshi immigrants in New York. PARTICIPANTS: 26 mothers with children aged 6-24 months receiving service in five pediatric centers and 15 pediatricians providing care in these settings. RESULTS: Both mothers and pediatricians described risky feeding practices, communication problems, and lack of compliance. Oral health for young children was a low priority for some mothers. Many, however, were concerned about childhood cavities but lacked the skills or resources to reduce their risk of cavities. CONCLUSIONS: The results support our plan to develop an empowerment-based counseling intervention to address caries risk in children. Pediatric dentists should be aware of the barriers to caries prevention in this group.",0,0,
1433,Prevention of child abuse and neglect with a home nurse visit program: Limiting effects of domestic violence,"Context Home visiting for families with young children has been promoted as an effective way to prevent child maltreatment, but few studies have examined the circumstances in which such programs achieve this goal. Purpose To investigate whether the presence of domestic violence limits the effects of home nurse visitation interventions in reducing confirmed reports of child abuse and neglect. Fifteen-year follow-up study of a randomized trial. Build a Semirural community in New York. Participants The follow-up study included 324 mothers and children of 400 socially disadvantaged pregnant women who had not had a live birth before and who were consecutively enrolled between April 1978 and September 1980. Interventions Families were randomly assigned to receive routine perinatal care (control group"";"" n = 184 follow-ups), routine care plus home nurse visits during pregnancy only (n = 100), or routine care plus home nurse visits during pregnancy. and by the child's second birthday (n = 116). Key Consequence Measures Number of verified reports isolated from government records and analyzed by the treatment group during the entire 15-year period in which the study child was included as the subject regardless of the perpetrator's identity, or the mother was included as the perpetrator regardless of the child's identity, and the level of domestic violence at home as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scale. Results Families who received home visits during pregnancy and infancy had significantly fewer reports of child maltreatment involving the mother as the perpetrator (P = .01) or the study child as the subject (P = .04) than families who did not receive home visits. The number of reports of maltreatment of mothers who received home visits only during pregnancy was not different from the control group. In mothers who were visited until the child's second birthday, the effect of treatment decreased as the level of domestic violence increased. Of the women who reported 28 or fewer cases of domestic violence (79% of the sample), mothers who made home visits over a 15-year period received significantly fewer reports of child maltreatment than mothers who did not receive longer-term interventions (P = .01). However, this intervention did not significantly reduce child maltreatment among mothers who reported more than 28 cases of domestic violence (21% of samples). Conclusions The existence of domestic violence may limit the effectiveness of interventions to reduce cases of child abuse and neglect.",0,0,
1434,Prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke with aggressive statin therapy in older adults using a team management model,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this review were to highlight recent clinical research results regarding the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in adults 65 years of age and older and to examine how nurses (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) work with physicians. team can better serve the needs of this fastest growing subset of the US population at high risk for cardiovascular events, including stroke. DATA SOURCES: This report has been compiled through a review of the scientific literature on the safety and efficacy of statin therapy, including effects on cardiovascular, coronary, and stroke endpoints, with particular reference to clinical trial results in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recent guidelines emphasize that age alone is not a reason to stop statin therapy in older adults. However, despite the evidence highlighted in this review that suggests that older patients can derive significant benefits from statin therapy, studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between age and treatment propensity. Often, elderly patients have multiple risk factors and many chronic comorbid conditions that complicate and hinder management in many intensive clinical practices. More comprehensive guidelines for the use of statin therapy in the elderly, including recommendations for treatment goals and developing a framework for the use of statins in stroke prevention, will assist caregivers in the management of this high-risk population. Finally, both NPs and PAs are well-trained and well-placed to manage patients with chronic stable cardiovascular disease (CVD). APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: Implementing a multidisciplinary team approach to identify individuals at risk and provide them with education, counseling and effective statin therapy will aid efforts to reduce the increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with CVD in older adults.",0,0,

While some smaller targeted prevention studies have found that the risk of depression can be reduced, these results have yet to be replicated and extended to large-scale, at-risk populations in different settings. Purpose To determine the effects of a group of cognitive behavioral (CB) prevention programs compared to usual care in preventing the onset of depression. Design, Setting, and Participants A multicenter randomized controlled trial of 316 adolescents (13-17 years of age) with current or pre-existing depressive disorder from August 2003 to February 2006 in 4 US cities. Adolescents had a past history. depression, present high but sub-diagnostic depressive symptoms, or both. Evaluations were made at baseline, after 8 weeks of intervention and 6 months of continuation. Intervention Adolescents were randomly assigned to a CB prevention program consisting of 8-week, 90-minute group sessions followed by 6-month follow-up sessions or were assigned alone to receive usual care. Main Outcome Measure The proportion and hazard ratio (HR) of a probable or definite depressive episode (ie, depressive symptom rating score Â¡Ã 4) for at least 2 weeks, as diagnosed by clinical interviewers. Results During post-continuation follow-up, the proportion and HR of depressive episodes were lower for those in a CB prevention program than those in normal care (21.4% vs. 32.7%""; HR, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI ], 0.40- 0.98) Adolescents in the CB prevention program also showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms than those in usual care (coefficient, ?1.1; z = ?2.2; P = .03). CI, 2.29-15.58; P = .001) Among adolescents whose parents were not depressed at baseline, the CB prevention program was more effective than normal care in preventing the onset of depression (11.7) 40.5% vs. HR, 0.24; 95% GA, 0.11–0.50), for adolescents with a currently depressed parent, the CB prevention program was no more effective than normal care in preventing event depression (31.2% vs. 24.3%; HR , 1.43;"" 95% CI, 0.76-2.67).

1436,Preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults: US Preventive Services Task Force advisory statement,"DESCRIPTION: Update to the 1996 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advisory statement on counseling to prevent home and recreational injuries, including falls. METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed recent evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care interventions for preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults. Interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactor clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home hazard modification, and exercise or physical therapy. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years and older at high risk of falls. (Class B recommendation) The USPSTF does not automatically recommend performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 and over because benefit is unlikely. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms based on previous falls, comorbid medical conditions, and patient values.

1437,Recommended Preventive Care (PCA)/Operative Care Advice (OCA)--classification of caries by management option,"number of systems and classifications are currently used by clinicians, epidemiologists, and clinical research professionals to classify carious lesions into different grades. These systems are based on the depth of the lesion and/or the presence/absence of macroscopic cavitation. To improve the relevance and comparability of such systems in light of the growing knowledge of disease process, lesion behavior, and caries management options, the authors propose a new categorization system that distinguishes between lesions that normally require operative intervention and lesions that require operative intervention. don't do that. In the future, it is recommended that, in addition to existing conventional criteria, diagnostic systems should allow results to be expressed in terms of 1) lesions for which appropriate non-invasive Preventive Care is Recommended (PCA lesions) and 2) lesions that are operative. Care Recommended (OCA lesions). Locally acceptable subdivisions may need to be developed and adopted for certain specific applications. Adoption of this additional terminology and approach in the future will aid communication between the different groups involved in caries diagnosis and research. In addition to facilitating the dissemination of research findings, it can help ""guide"" researchers working on caries diagnostic methods to focus on techniques that will assist in the accurate assessment of lesion activity and behavior. Such a focus should also increase our understanding of treatment decision making and encourage the development of clinical guidelines. The ability to keep existing criteria in parallel for local and other purposes will maintain comparability with previously collected data.",0,0,

1439,Preventive interventions for postpartum psychosis,"BACKGROUND: Postpartum psychosis is a life-threatening condition worldwide that affects one to two out of every 1,000 new mothers. It has a sudden onset within a month after birth. Affected new mothers quickly develop overt psychosis, cognitive impairment, and erratic behavior. Factors that increase the risk of postpartum psychosis include single mothers, older women, or women with a past psychiatric history, and a family history of affective psychosis, prenatal depression, and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of future postpartum recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postpartum psychosis aim to identify women with risk factors, early recognition of possible psychosis through screening, and preventive medication. Mood stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, and hormone therapy may be helpful in preventing postpartum psychotic episodes in at-risk women. OBJECTIVES: To explore the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postpartum psychosis. SEARCH METHODS: Using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's search strategy, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials on the prevention of postpartum psychosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors reviewed all citations to ensure reliable selection. If we had included relevant studies, we planned to assess the methodological quality of the identified studies using the criteria proposed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Detections. The two compilation authors would have independently extracted the data. For homogeneous binary data, we planned to calculate the hazard ratio (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat for benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on a goal-to-treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: There are no studies included in this review. The electronic search produced three relevant references, among which we identified two formerly planned studies that seemed to have never started, and excluded one study because it was the report of a case series. AUTHOR CONCLUSIONS: This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite the growing interest in women's mental health, the literature on postpartum psychosis is still very limited. Clinicians seem to have no choice but to continue their current practice, guided only by various clinical judgments. Women and their relatives at risk for postpartum psychosis are justified in being disappointed in the medical/research association. A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) study identified mainly case series. Policy makers do not have empirical evidence on which to base their guidelines. Of course, preventive interventions for postpartum psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomized studies. Current publications suggest that such work is possible and that research funders may want to make it a priority.",0,0,
1440,Compliance of primary care clinicians with guidelines for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain: results from a study of the efficacy of a collaborative approach to pain,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated primary care clinician-provided guideline-based care, predictors of documented guideline-compliant care, and association with pain-related functionality as documented in patients' medical records. Patients participated in a randomized trial of collaborative care for chronic musculoskeletal pain. The intervention included patient and primary care clinician education, symptom monitoring, and feedback to clinicians by the intervention team. METHODS: To assess compliance with the evidence-based treatment guidelines on which our intervention was based, we developed the Pain Process Checklist (PPC), an 8-item chart review tool. We then reviewed the electronic medical records of 365 senior patients treated for 12 months by 42 primary care clinicians. Intervention status, demographic and clinical variables were tested as predictors of PPC scores using generalized estimation equations (GEE). GEE was also used to test whether PPC scores predicted treatment response (>/= 30% reduction in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score). RESULTS: Care rates consistent with the documented guideline varied widely among PPC items; from 94% of patients addressing pain to 17% of patients using opioids whose side effects were addressed. Intervention status was unrelated to item scores, and PPC-7 totals did not differ significantly between patients receiving intervention and usual treatment (61.2%, standard error [SE] = 3.3% vs. 55.2%, SE = 2.6%, P = 0.15). In a multivariate model, higher PPC-7 scores were associated with obtaining a prescription for opioids (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, P = 0.007) and lower PPC-7 scores were associated with patient age (10-year difference OR = 0.97, P). associated. = 0.004). Finally, intervention patients who received quantitative pain and depression assessments were less likely to respond to treatment (18% vs. 33% assessed vs. P = 0.008 vs. 13% vs. 28%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: As measured by medical record review, additional education and clinician feedback did not increase the delivery of pain care consistent with documented guidelines, and adherence to guidelines by primary care clinicians did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.",0,0,
1441,Experience of primary care clinicians prescribing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis at a specialized community health center in Boston: lessons from early adopters,"INTRODUCTION: An estimated 1.2 million Americans have indications for using antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent transmission of HIV. For many of these at-risk individuals, the best opportunity to learn about and receive information about PrEP will be during routine visits to their general primary care clinician. However, very few general clinicians have prescribed PrEP because of practical concerns about providing PrEP in primary care settings. The experience of specialist primary care clinicians prescribing PrEP can inform the feasibility of PrEP delivery by general specialists. METHODS: During January-February 2015, 35 primary care clinicians at a Boston community health center specializing in the care of sexual and gender minorities completed anonymous questionnaires about their experience and practice of PrEP service. Responses were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two clinicians (response rate=91%) completed the questionnaires. Nearly all clinicians (97%) prescribed PrEP (median 20 patients, interquartile range 11-33). Most clinicians have reported testing and risk reduction counseling practices for PrEP that comply with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Clinicians noted that patients using PrEP rarely experienced drug toxicities and generally reported high compliance. However, some clinicians' practices differed from guideline recommendations, and some clinicians observed patients with increased risk behaviors. Most clinicians (79%) rated PrEP provision as easy to achieve, and 97% thought they were likely to prescribe PrEP in the future. CONCLUSIONS: In a primary care clinic specializing in HIV prevention, clinicians perceived that providing PrEP to a large number of patients was safe, feasible, and potentially effective. Efforts to involve general primary care clinicians in PrEP service may facilitate scaling up this effective intervention.",0,0,
1442,Basic care guidelines for consultation practices: effectiveness of computerized and paper-based versions. A cluster randomized controlled trial among newly qualified primary care physicians.,"Purpose: To compare the recent impact of computerized and paper-based versions of guidelines on qualified physician consultation practices. Methods: Two-armed randomized controlled trial. Physicians were randomized to receive computerized or textbook-based versions of the same guidelines for a 4-week study period. Physicians' compliance with the guidelines for laboratory, radiological, physical and other tests, procedures, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, physiotherapy, and referrals was measured by case note review. Results: 139 newly qualified doctors working in 96 primary health care centers in Finland participated in the study. Data from 4,633 patient interviews were summarized, of which 3,484 were eligible for further analysis. Physicians' compliance with guidelines was high (over 80% for laboratory use, radiology, physical examination, and referral). There was no significant difference in physician consultation practices in any of the outcomes measured between the computerized and textbook group. Conclusion: The guidelines are a useful source of information for newly qualified physicians working in primary care. However, the method of presentation of guidelines (either electronic or paper) has no influence on guideline use or impact on decisions. Other factors such as information seeking time, ease of use during consultation, updateability, production costs, and physicians' own preferences should be considered when choosing the way the guidelines are presented.",1,1,
1443,Primary care physicians' response to dissemination of practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Much effort has been devoted to establishing clinical practice guidelines, but relatively few studies address dissemination issues. Unless guides are used, little is gained. This study evaluates the impact of three methods for disseminating asthma guidelines on physicians' behaviors and attitudes towards educational strategies. METHODS: Asthma guidelines were mailed to 60 physicians at three District Health Education Centers in Arkansas. Dissemination efforts on one site included a brief summary, ""detailed"" phone calls from doctors, and a continuing medical education conference. The second area used computer strategies and the third area used a multimedia approach that included fax messages, posters, videotapes, audio cassettes and a continuing medical education conference. A fourth site with 22 participants served as the comparison. Data were collected through mailed questionnaires, outpatient chart reviews, and physician interviews. Changes between baseline and posttest evaluations after a 4 month intervention for drug use were calculated and the use of peak flow monitoring was compared with the control group (general linear model). Regression analyzes were used to identify physician and practice factors associated with specific training techniques. RESULTS: Each region showed improvement in drug use or peak flow monitoring, but none improved in all areas. The multimedia, constant reminder approach was well received, but there was little support for computing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts to disseminate clinical guidelines should include a variety of formats with an emphasis on concise summaries and frequent reminders. Social influence seems to play a role and will be a fertile field for further research.",0,1,
1444,Primary care physicians' use of lumbar spine imaging tests: implications for guidelines and practice pattern feedback,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce the variability in primary care physicians' use of procedures for imaging the lumbar spine. DESIGN: Controlled intervention using clinical practice guidance and practice model feedback. STUDY EXAMPLE: 67 internists and 28 family practitioners in a large, group model HMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intervention group physicians received clinical practice guidelines for low back pain, followed by three bimonthly feedback reports 4 months later on current rates of use for timber spine x-rays and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the lumbar spine. . Control group physicians received neither guidelines nor feedback reports. Automated radiology use data was used to compare changes in use rates and variability in use rates for intervention and control group physicians over the study period. Neither guideline alone nor guideline plus feedback was associated with a significant reduction in use rates or variability in use rates for the lumbar spine imaging procedures studied. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice guidelines and practice model feedback fail to meet their goals when characteristics of the practice environment and patient expectations and behavior are not defined and addressed.",0,0,
1445,Primary care provider attitudes are associated with smoking cessation counseling and referral.,"OBJECTIVE: Most primary care providers (PCPs) approve of the importance of smoking cessation, but counseling rates are low. We evaluated the consistency of PCP's attitudes towards smoking cessation counseling and corresponding smoking cessation behaviors. DESIGN: This was a post-intervention analysis of a population-based sample from a randomized controlled group trial to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines. SETTING: A total of 18 VA facilities participated in the Southwest and Western United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 PCPs completed a questionnaire 12 months after the implementation of the smoking cessation quality improvement (QI) program. His patients also completed 12 (n = 1080) and 18-month (n = 924) follow-up questionnaires. INTERVENTION: The quality improvement response included local prioritization, quality improvement plan development, implementation and monitoring. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCPs at intervention sites were more likely to counsel patients on smoking cessation (P = 0.04) but not referrals. PCP attitude towards smoking cessation counseling was strongly associated with reported counseling (P < 0.001) and referral (P = 0.01). Other relationships with counseling, perceived barrier ""patients are not interested in quitting"" (P = 0.01) and fewer years in practice (P = 0.03)""; other relationships with referral are specialist consultation (P < 0.0001) and perceived barrier ""refer is not appropriate"" (P = 0.001) (negative association) PCP attitudes were associated with higher rates of counselling, referral, and program participation CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of intervention participation, PCPs had attitudes consistent with reported smoking cessation behaviors, and more positive attitudes were more patient-reported. associated with higher rates of smoking cessation behaviour.The findings suggest that PCPs that approve smoking cessation counseling and referral may offer more treatment recommendations and have higher quit rates.",0,1,
1446,Primary Care Provider-Provided Smoking Cessation Interventions and Smoking Cessation Among Participants in the National Lung Screening Study,"SIGNIFICANCE: The National Lung Screening Study (NLST) found a reduction in lung cancer mortality among participants screened with low-dose computed tomography and chest radiography. In February 2015, Medicare announced its decision to include annual lung screening for patients with a significant smoking history. These guidelines support smoking cessation therapy in addition to screening, but the frequency and effectiveness of clinician-administered smoking cessation interventions after lung screening are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between clinician-reported 5As (issue, advise, evaluate, assist [talk about quitting or suggest or recommend smoking cessation medications] and adjust follow-up) after lung screening and smoking behavior changes. DESIGN, ENVIRONMENT, AND PARTICIPANTS: A paired case-control study of 3336 NLST participants who smoked at enrollment (cases were quitters and controls were smokers) examined participants' 5A birth rates and patterns after lung scanning and reported their smoking cessation behavior. MAIN RESULTS AND MEASURES: Prevalence of clinician-administered 5A and associated smoking cessation after lung screening. RESULTS: Delivery of 5As, 1 year after screening, was as follows: ask, 77.2%""; advise, 75.6%; evaluate, 63.4%; assist, 56.4%; and arrange follow-up, 10.4%. Demand, advice, and assessment sociodemographic were not significantly associated with quitting in multivariate models adjusted for characteristics, medical history, screening results, nicotine addiction, and motivation to quit. Assists were associated with a 40% increase in quit probability (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.63 ) and regulation was associated with a 46% increase in odds of quitting (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.19–1.79) Primary care providers for smokers participating in the NLST were associated with increased quitting; less intense interventions (ask, advise, and evaluate). However, rates of assistance and follow-up of regulation were relatively low.Our findings indicate the need for clinicians to take more active intervention steps to help screened patients quit smoking and confirms its usefulness.",0,0,
1447,Sensitivity of primary care providers to health risk behaviors reported by adolescent patients,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinicians' responsiveness to health risk behaviors reported by adolescent patients during a comprehensive clinical preventive services visit. DESIGN: Improbable sample of adolescent patients scheduled for routine physical examination. Setting: Seven clinical sites in Chicago, Ill. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen primary care providers and 95 adolescent patients aged 11 to 18 years. INTERVENTION: Providers provided comprehensive clinical preventive services to adolescent patients using the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services model. This model includes screening, guidance, physical examination and immunizations. Prior to the visit, adolescent patients completed a 52-item screening questionnaire containing a health risk behavioral profile. Responses to the screening questionnaire were discussed during the visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each provider's response to reported health risk behaviors was determined by comparing the adolescent patient's responses on the screening questionnaire with those reported during an adolescent debriefing about whether certain issues were discussed. Sensitivity to highly sensitive behaviors was determined by comparing the screening questionnaire and the medical record. RESULTS: On average, each adolescent patient reported 10 risk behaviors, 7 of which were discussed. The severity of the risk behavior reported, the number of reported biological health problems, and the gender of the adolescent patient were important determinants of the provider's responsiveness. The number of health-risk behaviors reported, duration of visit, professional role and gender of the provider, whether the adolescent was a recent patient, and the adolescent patient's age were unrelated to responsiveness. RESULTS: Providers addressed most of the health risk behaviors reported during a single visit, but responsiveness decreased when 3 or more biological health problems or relatively serious problems were reported. Steps can be taken to improve the responsiveness of providers.",0,0,

1449,"A primary care-based multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary medical education intervention for patients with systolic heart failure: lessons learned from a cluster randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Chronic (systolic) heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling condition. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines in primary care has been shown to improve health outcomes. The aim was to explore the impact of a multidisciplinary educational intervention (Train the Trainer = TTT) on patient and performance outcomes for general practitioners (GPs). METHODS: This article presents key findings from the trial and discusses lessons learned during the implementation of the TTT trial. Primary care practices were randomly assigned to the TTT intervention or control group. 37 GPs (18 TTTs, 19 controls) were randomized, and 168 patients (91 TTTs, 77 controls) with a definitive diagnosis of CHF were enrolled. GPs in the intervention group attended four meetings that discussed clinical practice guidelines and pharmacotherapy feedback. The primary outcome was patient self-reported quality of life at seven months using the SF-36 Physical Function scale. Secondary outcomes include other SF-36 scales, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), total mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, prescribing, depressive disorders (PHQ-9), behavior change (European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale), patient - Improving heart failure using perceived quality of care (EUROPEP) and NT-proBNP levels. An exploratory analysis was performed as recruitment targets were not met. RESULTS: Both groups had high initial success for most outcomes. At 7 months, there was no significant mean difference between groups for the primary outcome measure (-3.3, 95% CI -9.7 to 3.1, p = 0.30). The only difference in secondary outcomes regarding the prescription of aldosterone antagonists by GPs in the intervention group was significant differences between the group at follow-up (42% vs. 24%, adjusted OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13""; p = 0.02). did not change outcome or most secondary outcomes. Recruitment targets were not met and selection bias of participating GPs, as well as under-employment of practices and patients prohibit conclusive results, but CI demonstrates that intervention was not effective in this example.

1450,Primary care-based smoking interventions,"The primary care setting is an important place to promote smoking cessation. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing the effectiveness of brief smoking interventions and comprehensive programs delivered in primary care provide excellent evidence that such interventions significantly increase patients' smoking cessation rates and that the efficacy increases as the intervention dose increases. Unfortunately, despite the widespread dissemination of preventive service guidelines and positive physician attitudes towards such services, the current level of smoking cessation intervention by physicians in real-world settings is not high, making this a major research and public health concern. Interventions to increase the rate of implementation of provider-provided short smoking interventions can be broadly grouped into 'provider education', clinical systems and procedures (eg, screening and monitoring of patients); and institutional policy (eg reimbursement, coverage, performance measures). Given the significant impact primary care-based interventions have on smoking cessation, it is important to explore ways to increase their birth rates and effects.Research examples to motivate intervention questions include: What are the best incentives or combinations of incentives for physicians? What is the most effective for reminding providers to intervene? What are the strategies? How can each of these be best applied in different types of settings and systems? How can the stepped care and patient-care matching model be used? Examining factors such as reimbursement policies and benefits covered, tightly controlled It is not suitable for randomized trials. Therefore, there is a need to use quasi-experimental designs and apply qualitative strategies. These designs represent a different challenge for the research community.",0,0,
1451,Primary Coronary Intervention (PCI) in myocardial infarction network system in a German city (Essen),"In a German city (Essen, 490,000 people), a new network system was established in 2004 for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This included a so-called integrated care model (IV model) with the involvement of insurance companies. In a collaborative structure between invasive and noninvasive hospitals, general practitioners and cardiologists, and emergency systems, it can be realized that every patient with STEMI will be treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as possible according to current guidelines. Patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity, medication) were comparable to other trials and registries. The primary success rate was high (96.4%). Acute in-hospital outcomes showed a low mortality (7.6%). Latency times were comparable to other recordings. Time from symptom to balloon was 239 minutes, contact time with medical balloon was 95 minutes, time from door to balloon was 60 minutes, and time from puncture to balloon was 18 minutes (median values). The STEMI mesh system in Essen demonstrates the possibility of modern treatment in patients with myocardial infarction (primary PCI) in a collaborative modality among all participants in the healthcare system.",0,0,
1452,Primary prevention of diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular disease using a cognitive behavioral program aimed at lifestyle changes in people at risk: Design of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: The number of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) is increasing rapidly. This increase is largely due to lifestyle-related risk factors such as overweight, reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. Modifying these risk factors has the potential to delay or prevent the development of T2DM and CVD. It is hypothesized that a cognitive behavioral program (CBP) focusing on motivation and self-management, especially in people at high risk for CVD and/or T2DM, will improve lifestyle behaviors and ultimately reduce their risk. Development of T2DM and CVD. METHODS: 12,000 people aged 30-50 years living in various municipalities in the semi-rural West Friesland region will receive an invitation from their GP (n = 13) to measure their waist circumference with a tape measure. Persons with abdominal obesity (male waist >/= 102 cm, female waist > or= 88 cm) will be invited to participate in the second phase of screening, blood pressure, blood sample and anthropometric measurements. T2DM and CVD risk scores will then be calculated according to the ARIC and SCORE formulas, respectively. Persons with a score indicating a high risk of developing T2DM and/or CVD will then be randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 300) or the control group (n = 300). Participants in the intervention group will follow a targeted CBP. in changing dietary behaviors, physical activities and smoking behaviors. Counseling methods to be used are motivational interviewing (MI) and problem-solving therapy (PST), which specifically focus on intrinsic motivation for change and self-management of participants' problems. CBP will be provided by nurse practitioners trained in the participant's general practice and will consist of a maximum of six individual sessions of 30 minutes followed by 3-month reinforcement sessions over the phone. Participants in the control group will be given brochures containing health guidelines on physical activity and diet, and how to quit smoking. Primary outcome measures will be changes in T2DM and CVD risk scores. Secondary outcome measures would be changes in lifestyle behavior and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit ratios. All relevant direct and indirect costs will be measured and a 24-month follow-up will be made. DISCUSSION: Changing behaviors is difficult, it takes time, great effort and motivation. Combining the two counseling modalities, MI and PST, followed by supportive sessions, can result in sustained behavior change. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN59358434.",0,0,
1453,Preparation of Hand Hygiene Compliance in Clinical Environments,"Introduction: Effective hand hygiene is the most important procedure in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections. Traditional knowledge/education-based interventions have shown only modest benefits in adaptation. This study set out to investigate whether priming through olfactory and visual cues affects hand hygiene compliance. Methods: Randomized controlled trial in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at a teaching hospital in Miami, Florida. Primary outcome data included observations – a mix of healthcare professionals and service users were observed upon entering the ICU by 2 trained observers and their hand hygiene compliance was independently verified. Interventions included olfactory (clean, citrus scent) or visual lining (male or female eyes). The primary outcome measure was hand hygiene compliance (HHC), as measured by the visitor using the hand gel dispenser. Results: At the 5% level, there was substantial evidence that a clean, citrus scent significantly improved HHC (15.0% versus 46.9%, p = .0001). Compared to the control group, a significant improvement in HHC was seen when a picture of 'male eyes' was placed over the hand gel dispenser (15.0% versus 33.3%, p < .038). No significant improvement in HHC was seen when a picture of female eyes was placed in the same hand gel dispenser (15.0% vs. 10.0%, p = .626). Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to show that the preparation can affect HHC in a clinical setting. The findings suggest that priming interventions can be used to change other public health-related behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,1,
1454,Printed educational materials: implications for professional practice and health care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Printed educational materials (PEMs) are passive dissemination strategies commonly used to improve knowledge, awareness, attitudes, skills, professional practice, and patient outcomes. They are traditionally presented in paper formats such as monographs, peer-reviewed publications, and clinical guidelines and appear to be the most commonly adopted method for disseminating information. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of PEMs in improving process outcomes (including the behavior of healthcare professionals) and patient outcomes. To investigate whether the impact of characteristics of PEMs (e.g., source, content, format, mode of delivery, timing/frequency, complexity of targeted behavior change) influence process outcomes (including healthcare professional behavior and patient outcomes). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched up to July 2006: (a) EPOC Group Specialized Register (including database of studies pending evaluation (see 'Specialist Register' under 'Group Details')""; (b) The Cochrane Central (c) MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CAB Health. A recent search for MEDLINE was conducted in March 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled pre- and post-controlled studies (CBA), and interrupted time series analyzes (ITS) evaluating the impact of printed educational materials on healthcare practitioner practice and/or patient outcomes No language restrictions Any objective measures of professional performance (ordered number of tests, prescriptions for a particular drug) or patient health outcomes (for example, blood pressure, number of cesarean sections). z re-included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four reviewers independently undertook data abstraction using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist. Any disputes are resolved by discussion between the referees and the arbitrators. Statistical analysis was performed by considering dual process outcomes, continuous process outcomes, patient outcome binary measures, and patient outcome continuous measures. We have presented the results for all comparisons using a standard presentation method whenever possible. We reported the median effect size for each outcome type and the median of these effect sizes across studies separately for each study. MAIN RESULTS: 23 studies were included for this review. Evidence from this review indicated that PEMs have minor beneficial effects on professional practice. RCTs comparing PEMs with no interventions observed a median absolute risk difference: +4.3% (range -8.0% to +9.6%) in categorical process outcomes (eg, x-ray requests, prescribing, and smoking cessation activities) 6 studies ) and continuous process outcomes (eg drug change, x-ray requests per administration) relative risk difference +13.6% (range -5.0% to +26.6%, 4 studies). These findings are similar to those reported for ITS studies, although significantly larger effect sizes were observed (the relative risk difference ranged from 0.07% to 31%). In contrast, the median effect size for categorical measures of patient outcome (eg screening, return to work, smoking cessation) was -4.3% (range -0.4% to -4.6%, 3 studies)). Two studies reported -10% and -20.5% deterioration in continuous patient outcome data (eg, depression score, attempts to quit smoking). Minimal differences were observed in a study comparing PEMs with training workshops. In the two studies comparing PEMs and educational outreach, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. It was not possible to discover potential modifiers between studies. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show that PEMs when used alone can have a beneficial effect on process outcomes, but not on patient outcomes, compared with no intervention. Despite this wide range of effects reported for PEMs, the clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is unknown. There is not enough information on how to optimize training materials. The effectiveness of educational materials compared to other interventions is uncertain.",0,1,
1455,Printed educational messages fail to increase the use of thiazides as first-line medication for hypertension in primary care: a cluster randomized controlled trial [ISRCTN72772651,"BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the effectiveness of printed educational messages in contributing to increased evidence-based clinical practice is conflicting. However, these messages are filling doctor's offices to promote treatments that can reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated the ability of printed educational messages to promote the selection of thiazides as first-line therapy for individuals newly diagnosed with hypertension; this is a practice that is supported by good evidence and included in the guidelines and can reduce the costs of the health system. . METHODS: The study uses a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (doctor randomized by the practice group). SETTING: The setting includes all Ontario general/family physician physicians. Messages recommending the use of thiazides as first-line therapy for hypertension were mailed to each physician, along with a widely read professional newsletter. Physicians were randomly selected to receive different versions of the printed educational messages: an insert (two-page evidence-based article) and/or one of two versions of an ""outsert"" (a short, directive message stapled to the outside of the newsletter). One was developed without a clear theory, and the other with messages targeting factors from the theory of planned behavior or none (newsletter only, no mention of thiazides). Percentage of patients aged 65+ and newly diagnosed with hypertension who were prescribed a thiazide as the first prescribed single drug. The effect of the intervention was estimated using a logistic regression model estimated using generalized prediction equation methods to account for clustering of patients within physician practices. RESULTS: Four thousand five hundred four physicians (23,508 patients) were randomized and provided a 97% power to detect an absolute increase of 5% in thiazides prescribing. No interference effects were detected. Thiazide was prescribed to 27.6% of patients who saw a control physician, 27.4% for the insert, 26.8% of patients who saw an ophthalmologist, and 28.3% of patients who saw an insert + dentist, p = 0 ,54. CONCLUSIONS: The study failed to conclusively demonstrate any effect of the printed educational messages in prescribing thiazide diuretics for the first-line treatment of hypertension.

This article reviews the evidence for the administration of PRN psychotropic drugs and examines evidence-based best practice, current mental health policy. and in the context of professional ethics, it recommends a standard Australian PRN management protocol. The procedures and conditions that lead to a nurse administering psychotropic medication PRN medication is broken down into five simple steps: (i) medical prescription; (ii) nurse assessment of patient indications for an intervention; (iii) nurse's assessment of therapeutic options; (iv) obtaining patient informed consent;"" and (v) documenting the results of PRN administration. The literature pertaining to each step is reviewed, along with national and international professional ethics, guidelines, and patient rights documents on the care of mental health patients. Recommendations for maintenance best practices are discussed for each step. There is a lack of published evidence to support the use of PRN drugs in inpatient psychiatric patients. Nevertheless, there is published evidence that PRN drugs are associated with increased risks of morbidity, inappropriate use, may lead to the above recommended dosages or multi-pharmacy, and complicate evaluation of the efficacy of regularly scheduled drugs. Alternative non-pharmacological treatment options to PRN medication are effective and associated with fewer side effects. There are no clear national standards, operational criteria, or quality assurance regarding the use of PRN in inpatient psychiatry units. Contemporary PRN practices are largely unregulated and driven primarily by anecdotal evidence, leaving clinicians and the service vulnerable to allegations of poor accountability and misuse (intentional and unintentional) of psychotropic drugs. The development of best practice guidelines for the use of PRN management is essential.",0,0,

1459,Issues with implementation of guidelines: a randomized controlled trial of consensus management of dyspepsia.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and usefulness of developing guidelines for dyspepsia management with consensus among general practitioners (GPs) and specialists, and to evaluate GPs input on prescribing, using research, and referral. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of agreed consensus guidelines among family physicians and specialists on the behavior of general practitioners. SETTING: Southampton and South West Hampshire Health District, UK. SUBJECTS: Of 254 eligible GPs, 179 GPs working in 45 practices, 107 in the control group and 78 in the study group in the Southampton county. KEY MEASURES: Referral and research rates and prescribing costs for dyspepsia in the six months before and after the guidelines are implemented. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines were generated relatively easily. After their introduction, referral rates for upper gastrointestinal symptoms dropped significantly in both the study and control groups, but there were no significant changes in either group in terms of referral rates, patient selection, or use of endoscopy or radiology for research findings. No difference was observed between the control and study group in the number of substances prescribed, but in the study group, prescribing costs increased by 25% (from 2634 pounds per GP to 3215 pounds per GP), almost entirely due to the increased rate of prescribing ulcer-healing agents. CONCLUSION: It was possible to develop regional guidelines for managing dyspepsia with consensus among GPs and specialists. However, their acceptance and adoption was variable, and their measured effects on some aspects of clinical behavior were relatively weak and not necessarily associated with reduced costs or improved quality of care.",0,0,

New MRC guideline provides a framework for conducting and reporting process assessment studies Attempts to tackle problems such as smoking and obesity use increasingly complex interventions. These are often described as interventions consisting of multiple components in interaction, but additional complexity dimensions include the difficulty of their implementation and the number of organizational levels they target.1 Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of interventions in the following situations. randomization can be done. However, effect sizes do not provide policymakers with information on how an intervention can be replicated in their particular context or whether trial results can be reproduced. The previous MRC guideline for evaluating complex interventions focused on randomized trials made no mention of process evaluation.2 The updated guideline recognized the value of process assessment in trials and stated that it could be used to assess the fidelity and quality of trials. 3 However, it did not provide guidance for conducting process assessment. #### Highlights In 2010, a workshop funded by the MRC Demographic Health Sciences Research Network discussed the need for guidance on process evaluation.4 There was consensus among researchers, funders, and â € ™.",0,0,
1466,"Procrastination, Deadlines, and Performance: Self-Control with Pre-Commitment","Procrastination is very familiar to most people. People delay writing their research (we hear!), repeatedly saying they'll start their diet tomorrow, or delaying chores at home until next week. Still, people sometimes try to control their procrastination by setting deadlines for themselves. In this article, we ask three questions: (a) Are people willing to impose meaningful (i.e. costly) deadlines on themselves to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When setting their own deadlines, do people adjust them optimally for maximum performance gains? A series of studies examining these issues empirically showed that the answer to the first two questions was ""yes"" and to the third question ""no"". People have self-control issues, they recognize them and try to control them by imposing costly deadlines on them. These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they are not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.",0,0,
1467,Professional and social support for hysterectomy patients,"This article describes a social support study for women who have had a hysterectomy and shows how the original research plans should be modified when early interviews revealed women's needs for basic information and their willingness to receive it from the researcher. The modified design allowed comparisons between a group of women who received information as part of the research interview and a second group who did not receive such assistance. Follow-up after hysterectomy at 3 months showed significant differences between the 2 groups, with the 'information group' less hostile but more critical for hospital treatment. The study also confirms the same author's previous findings regarding overall high satisfaction, health, and resumption of activities after hysterectomy. Regarding social support, it is suggested that full-time housewives especially need support from nurses due to their relative isolation from other sources of support and information. However, all interviewees would have sought more information and support from their healthcare professionals. Despite the acknowledged limitations of the study, some guidelines are offered for nurses trying to increase their level of professional and professional support for their patients.",0,0,
1468,Professional interventions for the management of musculoskeletal disorders for general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal conditions require special management skills. Identifying interventions that are effective in equipping general practitioners (GPs) with such essential skills can mean better health outcomes for patients and lower health and societal costs. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of professional interventions for GPs aimed at improving the management of musculoskeletal disorders in primary care. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2010, Issue 2""; MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 - October 2013); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 - October 2013); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980 - November 2013) and We performed citation reference searches using the EPOC Specialized Register. ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar and manually searched selected issues of Arthritis and Rheumatism and Primary Care Clinics in Office Practice. The most recent search was in November 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled pre- and post-controlled studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of professional interventions for GPs in a community setting, musculoskeletal We aimed to improve the management (including diagnosis and treatment) of GP disorders and to report any objective measure of GP behavior, patient or economic outcomes. length, duration, density, and complexity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently summarized all data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and odds ratio (RR) of adherence to desired practice for dual outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) for sustained outcomes. We investigated whether the direction of targeted behavior change affected the effectiveness of interventions. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria. Out of 11 studies on osteoporosis, a meta-analysis of five studies (high-confidence evidence) showed that there was a combination of a GP alert system and a patient-directed intervention about a patient's increased risk of osteoporosis. (including patient education and a reminder to see their GP), diagnostic bone mineral density (BMD) testing, and prescribing osteoporosis medication (RR 4.44; (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.54 to 5.55; 3 studies; 3,386) for improves GP behavior (participant) and for osteoporosis medication RR 1.71 (95% CI 1.50 to 1.94; 5 studies; 4,223 participants). A meta-analysis of two studies showed that GP stimulation by itself likely improved GP behavior consistent with the osteoporosis guideline (RR 4.75 (95% CI 3.62 to 6.24; 3,047 participants)) for BMD and RR 1.52 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.84; 3,047 participants) and The addition of the patient-directed component probably did not result in a greater effect for BMD and RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.10) (RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 2.995 participants));"" 2,995 participants). Feedback on the total number of studies requested may have an impact on GP behavior and may result in a slight reduction in the number of tests, one of these studies adding to the radiology reports of the combination of guidelines and GP r may result in a small but sustained reduction in the number of research requests. One study out of four studies on osteoarthritis found that the use of educationally effective physicians can result in improvement in GP behavior consistent with the guideline. stered. Another study showed slight improvements in patient outcomes (pain control) after GPs trained in pain management. One study out of three studies on shoulder pain reported little or no improvement in patient outcomes (functional capacity) after GP training on shoulder pain. and injection training. One of two studies on other musculoskeletal conditions, a study on pain management, showed that there may be worse patient outcomes (pain control) after GP training on the use of validated rating scales. The remaining 12 studies have shown little in all musculoskeletal disorders. or no improvement in GP behavior and patient outcomes. The direction of the targeted behavior (i.e. increasing or decreasing a behavior) does not seem to affect the effectiveness of an intervention. Most studies did not explore the potential adverse effects of interventions, and only three studies included a cost-effectiveness analysis. Overall, there were significant methodological limitations in the nature of the evidence, and only one-third of the studies reported adequate allocation confidentiality. and blind outcome assessments. While our confidence in the combined effect estimate of interventions to improve diagnostic testing and drug prescribing in osteoporosis is high, our confidence in the effect estimates reported in the remaining studies is low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is good quality evidence that a GP alert system with or without patient education on osteoporosis improves guideline-consistent GP behavior and results in better diagnosis and treatment rates. Interventions such as GP reminder messages and performance-related GP feedback, combined with dissemination of the guideline, may result in minor improvements in GP behavior consistent with the guideline regarding low back pain, while GP education on osteoarthritis pain and the use of educationally effective physicians have resulted in a slight decrease in patient outcomes and behavior consistent with the guideline, respectively. can lead to recovery. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of such interventions in improving GP behavior and patient outcomes.",0,1,
1469,Prognosis research strategy (PROGRESS) 1: a framework for investigating clinical outcomes,"Understanding and improving the prognosis of a disease or health condition is a priority in clinical research and practice. In this article, the authors present a framework of four interrelated themes in prognostic research, explain the importance of the first of these themes (understanding future outcomes in relation to current diagnostic and therapeutic practices), and offer recommendations for the field of prognosis research. In clinical medicine, the term prognosis refers to the risk of future health outcomes in people with a particular disease or health condition. Thus, prognosis research is the study of associations between future outcomes (endpoints) among people with a particular baseline health condition (baseline) to improve health (see supplemental figure on bmj.com). The study of prognosis has never been more important because more people globally are living with one or more diseases or debilitating conditions than ever before.1 Therefore, governments around the world are now increasing their attention to health care outcomes. Similarly, research funders and researchers are increasingly focusing on translating new interventions and technologies from laboratory to clinical practice and then health policy to establish and implement new high-quality standards of care and improve patient outcomes. Prognosis research findings should therefore be an integral part of exploring and evaluating new approaches to clinical decision making, health policy, and patient management. However, there is an alarming gap between the potential and actual impact of prognostic research on health. Prognosis research studies lag far behind the high standards required in other fields such as therapeutic trials and genetic epidemiology. In the PROGnosis RESEARCH Strategy (PROGRESS) series (www.progress-partnership.org), we propose a framework made up of four distinct but interrelated prognosis research themes:",0,0,
1470,Promising advances in neuropsychological approaches for the detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease: a selective review.,"Recently published guidelines suggest that the best time to treat individuals with Alzheimer's disease is the preclinical stage of the disease. This is a stage where individuals are defined as clinically normal but show signs of amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and subtle cognitive/behavioral decline. While our standard cognitive tests are useful for detecting cognitive decline at the stage of mild cognitive impairment, they are not designed to detect subtle cognitive variations associated with this biomarker stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. However, neuropsychologists are attempting to circumvent this challenge by designing newer cognitive measures and questionnaires derived from translational efforts in neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical/experimental neuropsychology. This review is a selective summary of several new, potentially promising approaches under investigation to detect early cognitive evidence of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in presymptomatic individuals.",0,0,
1471,Promoting evidence-based psychosocial care for cancer patients,"With the large number of studies showing that psychosocial care reduces distress and improves quality of life, practitioners have an obligation to treat cancer patients consistent with this evidence. While the rationale is simple, there are major challenges in achieving the goal of translating research into clinical practice. One challenge has been the nature of the evidence, with many psychosocial intervention studies characterized by poor methodological quality, the absence of eligibility criteria indicating increased distress, and minimal consideration of spillover potential. A second challenge has been to make practitioners aware of relevant evidence. Targeted dissemination efforts, such as publishing clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based recommendations and distributing intervention materials over the Internet, appear to be more effective than passive efforts at providing useful information to practitioners. Perhaps the most challenging aspect has been persuading practitioners to change their practice. An approach currently under development would allow practitioners and health care organizations to make self-assessments of the quality of their psychosocial care based on a review of medical records. Feedback that indicates the quality of care is sub-optimal is likely to motivate change, especially if the quality indicators evaluated are considered important and reliable and point to specific actions that can be taken. Using evidence to encourage changes in clinical practice represents one of the primary ways the psycho-oncology field is fully realizing its potential to positively impact the lives of people with cancer.",0,0,
1472,Promoting Hand Hygiene Compliance,"BACKGROUND: German ""Clean Hands Campaign"" to promote hand hygiene among hospital staff at the Hanover Medical School (MHH, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover), known as Aktion Saubere Hande (ASH) (an adaptation of the WHO ""Clean Care is Safer Care"" programme) ), met with initial success. By 2013, however, compliance rates with hygienic hand disinfection in the hospital's ten intensive care units (ICUs) and two hematopoietic stem cell transplant units (HSCTU) had returned to their original levels (doctors: 48%"";"" nurses: 56%). The cluster randomized controlled trial of PSYGIENE was conducted to explore whether tailored interventions in ways suggested by behavioral psychology research could bring more sustainable improvements from ASH. METHODS: The ""Health Action Process Approach"" (HAPA) adjustment model specifies the main psychological determinants of adjustment. These determinants were assessed through questionnaires (response rates: doctors: 71%""; nurses: 63%) among healthcare workers in MHH's ICUs and ICUs, and interviews with responsible ward physicians and head nurses (100%). While 29 special behavior modification techniques were applied in trainer training sessions and feedback discussions in the six wards that constitute the intervention arm of the research, ASH trainings were provided in the control arm. RESULTS: The two groups did not differ in baseline compliance rates (intervention: 54%, control: 55% , p = 0.581) in 2013. Customized interventions resulted in improved compliance in each of the two follow-up years (2014: 64%, p<0.001;"" 2015: 70%, p = 0.001), the control arm increased to 68% in 2014 (p<0.001) but decreased to 64% in 2015 (p = 0.007). Increases in compliance between 2013 and 2015 and compliance rate in 2015 were higher in the intervention arm (p<0.005). This can mainly be attributed to the behavior of nurses, as the corresponding parameters for physicians did not differ significantly between the two study arms in the stratified analysis. CONCLUSION: Specific interventions based on behavioral psychology principles led to more sustained increases in compliance with hand hygiene guidelines than ASH training sessions. This was also true for nurses and thus for hospital ward staff as a whole (ie, nurses and doctors together). More studies are needed to identify more target group-specific interventions that could improve adherence among physicians.",0,1,
1473,Promoting the recovery of patients with schizophrenia: discrepancy between routine practice and evidence. SIEP-DIRECT'S Project,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to present the main differences between the evidence-based NICE guidelines for schizophrenia and the usual practice of Italian mental health services to promote patient recovery, as evidenced by the SIEP-DIRECT'S Project. with schizophrenia. METHODS: 41 indicators have been developed, starting with the main NICE recommendations on promoting recovery. These were tested in 19 participating Italian Departments of Mental Health (MHD) or Psychiatric Services through self-assessment of activities to promote patient recovery, in order to assess the level of adherence to recommendations. The data needed for most of the indicators were obtained from the psychiatric information system or the MHD Referral. In addition, specific studies were conducted on clinical records and representative patient samples. In addition, an assessment was requested for the 14 indicators by a section of the ""multidisciplinary"" or ""expert"" focus groups, which then awarded a score according to a defined ""ad hoc"" scale. CONCLUSIONS: According to the data obtained, although mental health services seem to care about the physical condition of their patients, they routinely monitor blood pressure, glycemia, etc. does not examine key parameters and collaboration with GPs is often complex or not. applied uniformly. Most psychiatrists and psychologists have basic communication skills but are not proficient in cognitive-behavioral treatments"";"" such treatments and any other form of structured individual psychotherapy are rarely performed and appear to have become marginal activities within the Services. In addition, family psycho-educational interventions are not used sufficiently. Services are very active in the care of patients with very problematic schizophrenia, who make up a large percentage of the patients in their care (almost a quarter on average). Special and integrated treatment plans are offered to these patients with the participation of other health services and social institutions operating in the region. The strategies implemented by the wards for pharmacological treatment in the prevention of relapses and for patients with schizophrenia with frequent crises or treatment-resistant schizophrenia are all in line with NICE recommendations. Finally, the Services promote vocational training activities and supported employment, but their results are often unsatisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show a picture of Italian mental health services with both light and dark areas in terms of recovery-promoting activities. The services appear to guarantee adequate pharmacological evidence-based treatments, integrated assistance and good management of patients with multiple problems. However, they have difficulties in monitoring the physical health of patients, promoting psychotherapeutic activities, including those for families, and supported employment. In addition, they still show problems in structuring and formalizing maintenance processes. They should make greater use of professional guidelines, protocols and written procedures to improve this situation.",0,0,
1474,Promoting screening mammography in urban settings: a randomized controlled trial of computerized reminders as a component of a program to facilitate mammography.,"In a one-year randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of a computed mammography reminder system as a component of a program to increase the use of screening mammography in three healthcare facilities (two districts) serving women in downtown Detroit, Michigan. a health department, an HMO site and two sites of a private hospital). Four thousand four hundred and one women over the age of 40 who had visited a study site in the previous year were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. The limited intervention (LI) included physician and staff breast cancer control education, streamlined mammography appointment scheduling procedures, and elimination of the out-of-pocket patient cost for mammography (at three out of five centres). The full intervention (FI) included all the components of the limited intervention and an additional set of ""action tips"". These included a mammogram reminder form added to the medical records of women with mammography appointments, aimed at increasing doctor referrals for mammography appointments, and patient reminders to increase mammography completion among referral women. During the one-year intervention period, 2,725 randomized women visited a study site. Among FI women, 6-month mammography appointment rates range from 38% to 65%, and the FI rate exceeds the LI rate in each region, with differences from 13% (95% CI, 6 to 20) to 29% (21 to 38). . The annual rate of completed mammograms among FI women increases from 43% to 64%, exceeding the LI rate by 12% (5 to 19) to 25% (16 to 34) in each region. After adjusting for age, mammography intervention effect sizes were not significantly different between the five sites. The mean increase in FI compared to LI was 18%. The computerized reminder system is effective in increasing the use of mammography in each of the study establishments, and its greatest impact is on physician referral for mammography.",0,1,
1475,Promoting self-management through cohesion among heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals: a study protocol.,"UNLABELED: Background Heart failure is one of the most common chronic conditions in adults, causing long-term morbidity, repeated hospitalizations, and placing a huge economic burden on the health system. Heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals or primarily critical access hospitals have higher 30-day readmission and death rates compared to patients discharged from city hospitals. Self-management improves health outcomes and reduces readmissions for heart failure patients, but adherence to self-management guidelines is low. We propose a home post-acute care service led by advanced nurses to increase patient activation and lead to improved adherence to self-management in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals. Purpose This article describes the study design and research methods used to implement and evaluate the intervention. Our Method Intervention is a 12-week patient activation (Home Patient Active Care [PATCH]) to improve adherence to self-management. Patients were randomized into two parallel groups (12-week PATCH intervention + usual care versus usual care only) to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention. Results were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Discussion This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a rural theory-based, nurse-led, activation-enhancing intervention on self-management compliance in heart failure patients living in rural areas. Our expectation is to facilitate compliance with self-management behaviors in heart failure patients after discharge from provincial hospitals, and to reduce the economic burden by reducing complications and hospital readmissions.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an intervention targeting physicians and their patients on CRC screening rates. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial for community physicians and their patients. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four community primary care physicians were randomly assigned to an intervention consisting of academic details and direct mail to patients or a control group. Patients aged between 50 and 79 in the intervention group were given a letter from their physician, a brochure on CRC screening, and a pack of stool occult blood test (FOBT) cards. MEASUREMENTS: We measured after 1 year the following: (1) FOBT in the past 2 years, (2) flexible sigmoidoscopy (SIG) or colonoscopy (COL) in the previous 5 years, and (3) any CRC scan. We report percent change from baseline in both groups. RESULTS: 9,652 patients were enrolled for 2 years, 3,732 patients for 5 years. For patients enrolled over 2 years, there was no increase in any CRC screening occurring in the intervention group (12.5% versus 12.7 increase, P=.51). Similar results were seen for any CRC screening among patients enrolled at 5 years (8.6% versus 9.7% increase, P=.45). The only outcome for which intervention was effective was on patient SIG screening rates (4.4% versus 7.4% increase, P<.01). CONCLUSION: The intervention had no effect on CRC screening rates, except for the increase in SIG rates in the intervention group. Future interventions should consider innovative approaches to increase CRC screening rates.",0,1,
1477,Promoting and prescribing hormone therapy after harm reporting by the Women's Health Initiative,"Context Little is known about how the pharmaceutical industry responds to evidence of harm associated with its products; For example, as in the Women's Health Initiative's Estrogen Plus Progestin Trial (WHI E+P) report published in July 2002, standard-Dose Prempro did significant harm and lacked clear benefits. Purpose To examine the pharmaceutical industry's response to WHI E+P results by analyzing promotional spending for hormone therapy before and after July 2002. Design and Adjustment Nationally representative and prospectively collected longitudinal data (January 2001 - December 2003) on the prescribing and promotion of hormone therapies were obtained from IMS Health and Consumer Media Reports. Key Outcomes Measures Trends in quarterly hormone therapy prescriptions and spend on 5 types of drug promotion: samples, office-based detailing, hospital-based promotion, magazine advertisements, and direct-to-consumer advertising. Results Prior to the WHI E+P report, prescribing rates and promotional expenditure for hormone therapy were stable. In the quarter preceding the WHI E+P report (April-June 2002), 22.4 million prescriptions were dispensed for hormone therapy and $71 million was spent on promotion ($350 per year per US doctor, per year). Within 9 months of the report's publication (Q1 2003), there was a 32% reduction in hormone therapy prescriptions and a bottom point for promotional spending was reached (37% reduction levels compared to pre-WHI E+P). Spending on all promotional activities and most hormone therapy decreased. Overall, the largest decreases were in samples (36% decrease as of Q1 2003) and direct-to-consumer advertising (100% decrease). The largest reductions in promotion occurred with the standard dose of Prempro, the agent specified in the WHI E+P report (61% decrease as of Q1 2003). More recently, promotional efforts have increased, particularly for low-dose Prempro, a resurgence associated with modestly increasing prescriptions for this new agent. Conclusions Consistent with its widespread use, hormone therapy was among the most promoted drugs before the WHI E+P report. After reporting the evidence of harm from this trial, there was a significant reduction in promotional spending for hormone therapy, particularly for agents that had a direct role in the trial. In conjunction with the impact of the trial results itself and the media coverage that followed, the reduced promotion may have contributed to a significant decline in hormone therapy prescriptions.",0,0,
1478,Appropriate antibiotic therapy. Pharmacogenomics from penicillin,"Antibiotics have always been considered one of the great discoveries of the 20th century. The use of penicillin by Flaming ushered in the golden age of antibiotics, and it is now hard to imagine the practice of medicine without antibiotics. Life-threatening infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremic pneumonia sepsis can also be fatal. Also, aggressive chemotherapy and transplant procedures would be impossible. Another real miracle is the rise of antibiotic resistance soon after the clinical use of penicillin in hospitals and communities. A few studies have shown that over-prescribed antibiotics for patients and inpatients in the community, and in some hospitals up to 50% of antibiotic use is inappropriate: the benefits of antibiotic therapy come with the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with higher mortality, morbidity, and prolonged hospital stay compared to infections caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce cost and improve the quality of drug use. Education, guidelines, and evidence-based advice are considered essential elements of any program designed to influence prescribing behavior and can provide a knowledge base that will enhance and increase acceptance of management strategies. An approach to clinical practice that assists in making decisions based on evidence-based advice, clinical expertise, and candid knowledge of the individual patient's conditions, beliefs, and priorities, enhances antimicrobial management, including appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy, emergence of resistance, adverse drug events It can maximize clinical improvement or prevention of infection while limiting undesirable consequences such as cost and cost. These evidence-based guidelines are not a substitute for clinical judgment and their application always requires clinical judgment. Genome studies have identified hundreds of genetic polymorphisms that are important predictors of treatment efficacy, and several trials have demonstrated the successful use of pharmacogenomic testing to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in patients. Knowing the patient's phenotype before treatment, optimal doses and types of drugs can be prescribed to ensure better management of patients.",0,0,
1479,Infection prophylaxis after appendicitis surgery: current surgical practice research,"Two hundred and eighty questionnaires were sent to junior surgical staff across the UK asking about the use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, topical antibacterial agents and surgical drainage in appendectomy. One hundred and seventy-five (63%) responses were received from 81 of the 87 hospitals included in the survey. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics were used by 78 surgeons (46%) when operating on a normal appendix, but by 168 (99%) when the organ was perforated. Most surgeons began using antibiotics prior to surgery, but proportionately fewer did when the appendix was gangrenous or perforated. Patients with severe contamination tended to receive longer courses of antibiotics, although the duration of administration varied significantly. Metronidazole was included in more than 95% of all prophylactic regimens and was often combined with other drugs when the appendix was gangrenous and perforated. Topical antibacterial agents were routinely applied to the wound by only 45 surgeons (26%), but 106 (61%) occasionally used them. Povidone-iodine was the most commonly used agent. Only 98 surgeons (56%) drained appendectomy wounds, while 135 (77%) sometimes drained the peritoneal cavity. Evidence suggests that current methods of administering systemic antibiotic prophylaxis should continue, but topical agents and surgical drainage are perhaps unnecessary once surgeons are confident of the efficacy of the systemic therapy used.",0,0,

Significantly better control was achieved for patients on more intensive therapy with an assigned target range of 3.0-4.5 computerized dosing programs"";"" medical staff undertreated such patients almost 50% of the time. CONCLUSION--Computer-based programs can aid in anticoagulant control with warfarin in the outpatient, both early and during long-term treatment. The control achieved for most patients is as good as control achieved by experienced clinicians with the traditional dosing method, but the latter tends to be very conservative when dosed to patients within the intense target range of 3.0 to 4.5 International Normalized Ratio (INR). .

In phase 1, the system collected information but did not alert caregivers. In phase 2, caregivers were informed by an alphanumeric call and a text entry into the electronic medical record of patients' potential illness, and specific recommendations were provided. Results Patients (33,460) were screened for 6 months""; 398 patients, including 184 (46%) appropriately identified as severe septic, activated the system. The algorithm had a 54% positive predictive value and 99% negative predictive value in detecting severe infection. Acute organ dysfunction The median time for patients to accumulate SIRS and blood pressure criteria was 152 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 71 to 284 minutes), which underlines the dynamic nature of critical illness diagnosis in an emergency and underlines the need for detection algorithms to re-evaluate patients during their assessment. After administration, 2 more frequent interventions were performed, pre-admission chest X-ray (probability ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.5) and blood culture (odd ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.1) 7.7) Blood culture test only, performed significantly faster in the presence of decision support (inter-ventilation 86 minutes, IQR 31, 296 minutes; intervention median time to culture after 81 min, IQR 37, 245 min;"" P=.032 by Cox proportional hazard modeling. The dominant lack of strategy has failed to detect severe septic cases before caregivers.

1489,pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial protocol to reduce irrational antibiotic prescription among children with upper respiratory tract infections in rural China.,"INTRODUCTION: Irrational use of antibiotics is a serious problem in China and internationally. In 2012, China's Ministry of Health issued a regulation limiting antibiotic prescriptions to <20% of all outpatient prescriptions, but no operational details on policy implementation were published. This study aims to test the efficacy of a multidimensional intervention designed to reduce antibiotic use among children (2-14 years) with acute upper respiratory tract infections in rural primary care settings in China by changing physician prescribing behaviors and educating parents. /caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, parallel group controlled, cluster randomized superiority trial with blinded evaluation of results and data analysis and unblinded treatment. Of the two counties in Guangxi Province, 12 county hospitals will be randomized to the intervention arm and 13 to the control arm. In the control arm, the management of antibiotic prescriptions will continue through usual care through clinical consultations. In the intervention arm, a provider and patient/caregiver focused intervention will be incorporated into routine primary care practices. Provider intervention includes operational guidelines, systematic education, peer review of antibiotic prescribing, and health education to caregivers. We will also provide printed educational materials and educational videos to caregivers. The primary outcome is the proportion of all provider-issued prescriptions for upper respiratory tract infections in children aged 2-14 years containing at least one antibiotic. ETHICS AND EXPANDATION: The research received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the Guangxi Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China. Results will be disseminated through workshops, policy briefs, peer-reviewed publications, and local and international conferences.

While SMART Recovery's principles (eg, self-efficacy) and therapeutic approaches (eg, motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy) are evidence-based, more clarity is needed regarding direct evidence of its effectiveness as a mutual aid package. Compared to the methodologically rigorous reviews supporting the effectiveness of 12-step approaches to date, the SMART Recovery reviews have been revealing. We aim to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the evidence for SMART Improvement in adults with problem alcohol, substance and/or behavioral addictions; this includes a comment on the evaluated results, potential intermediaries, feasibility (including economic consequences), and a critical evaluation. one of the methods used. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Methods are informed by the Cochrane Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items and Meta-Analysis statement for Systematic Reviews. 6 electronic peer-reviewed and 4 gray literature databases were identified. Preliminary searches have been conducted for the SMART Recovery literature (free inclusion criteria are not limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), only qualitative designs are excluded). Eligible 'review' articles will be evaluated against standard criteria and checked by an independent reviewer.

When administered, the drug can reduce recurrence. However, despite compliance, relapse remains common and functional outcomes often remain at risk. Compatibility is also generally low. Cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality also rise with several important modifiable health risk behaviors. Access to psychosocial interventions is therefore important, but currently limited. Telephone interventions represent a promising solution, although more clarity is needed. Accordingly, (1) relapse, (2) dependence on psychiatric medication, and/or (3) modifiable cardiovascular health risk behaviors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our methods are informed by published guidelines.

1493,"Provider attitudes towards oral pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention among high-risk men who have sex with men in Lima, Peru","Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was the first biomedical intervention to show efficacy in preventing HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). Health care providers' attitudes towards PrEP will be critical in translating this finding into effective public health delivery programs. In a convenient sample of 186 healthcare providers in Peru, we evaluated knowledge, barriers, and attitudes to prescribing and monitoring HIV PrEP for high-risk MSM and trans women, the populations with the highest incidence of HIV in this setting. A total of 57.5% reported PrEP awareness and awareness was independently associated with looking at more than 50 MSMs (OR: 3.67, p<0.002). Lack of local guidelines, concerns about increasing high-risk behavior, antiretroviral drug resistance, and limited availability of antiretrovirals for HIV-infected individuals were the most common barriers to prescribing PrEP. 44.6% of all physicians said they are now more likely to prescribe oral PrEP"";"" Probability of prescribing if PrEP is supported by local guidelines (70.3%, p<0.001), supports further study efficacy (68.5%, p<0.001), and intermittent use is shown to be effective (62.2%, p<0.001) was higher. =0.019).

1494,Provider detailing: an intervention to reduce prescription opioid deaths in Utah,"BACKGROUND: Utah has made a multi-pronged effort to reverse the epidemic of death among patients taking prescription opioids. This article describes the provider details of the effort. METHODS: Presentations highlighting the six recommended prescribing practices were developed and presented to healthcare professionals. Participants were encouraged to use the state prescription database and complete a series of questionnaires that assessed confidence and behavior changes at 0, 1, and 6 months after presentation. Continuing medical education credits encouraged participation. RESULTS: Utah's drug-induced overdose deaths fell 14.0% in 2008 compared to 2007 after program implementation. A total of 581 physicians and many non-physician healthcare professionals were reached in 46 presentations. Monitoring surveys on the degree of adoption of application changes were completed by 366 respondents at 0 months, 82 at 1 month, and 29 at 6 months. Combined results for all three assessments reported that 60-80% of responding providers no longer prescribed long-acting opioids for acute pain or tranquilizers""; 50% using Utah's database of controlled substances during patient care and lower starting doses and Saved using slower increments. ;"" and 30-50% reported receiving ECG and sleep studies in eligible patients, using patient education tools, and following Utah's prescribing guidelines.

1495,Provider training to promote the application of clinical practice guidelines,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although interest in and publication of clinical practice guidelines has increased significantly over the past 20 years, there are concerns about their actual application. This article focuses on one strategy to encourage practice of guidelines at the clinician level: clinician education. The aims of the article are to review training strategies, to evaluate them in the context of complementary strategies carried out at organizational and clinical setting levels, and to summarize challenges and recommendations for continuing education of clinicians. METHODS: Experience and data from relevant randomized clinical trials are reviewed in an educational framework. OBSERVATIONS: Implementing clinical practice guidelines requires a variety of skills, including assessment, appropriate definition of a treatment and monitoring plan, patient follow-up, and patient counseling and training skills. Continuing education strategies should reflect the content and teaching methods best suited to the learning objectives. The pressures of today's practice place limitations on the resources available for continuing education, particularly clinician time. Institutional resources should be dedicated to establishing the complementary supportive systems necessary for improved clinician practice. In addition to physicians, training should be aimed at non-physician clinicians, office staff, and managers who are also responsible for the implementation of the guideline. CONCLUSIONS: To meet the challenges of improving clinician motivation, balancing competing demands, and treating patients with complex medical conditions within time constraints, clinical leaders need to design educational activities with leadership support, reflective evidence, using multiple strategies and teaching techniques. and engage students in skill development and problem solving.",0,0,
1496,Providing social norm feedback to high antibiotic prescribers in general practice: a pragmatic national randomized controlled trial.,"Background Unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance. In this trial, we aimed to reduce the unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics by GPs (GPs) in the UK. Methods In this randomized, 2?Ã—?2 factorial trial, public databases were used to identify GP practices with antibiotic prescribing rates in the top 20% for the NHS Local Area Team. Eligible applications were randomly divided into two groups (1:1) in order of computer-generated allocation, stratified by the NHS Local Area Team. Participants, not researchers, were blinded to group assignments. On 29 September 2014, each GP in the feedback intervention group was sent a letter from the UK's Chief Medical Officer and a brochure on antibiotics for use in patients. The letter noted that the practice prescribed antibiotics in more than 80% of practices in the NHS Local Area Team. General practitioners in the control group received no communication. The sample was re-randomized into two groups, and in December 2014, GP practices were either sent patient-oriented information that reduced antibiotic use or received no communication. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of antibiotic substances dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for past prescriptions. The analysis was therapeutic. This trial is registered and completed with ISRCTN registration number ISRCTN32349954. Results Between September 8 and September 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1581 GP practices to the feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups. Letters were sent to 3227 general practitioners in the intervention group. Between October 2014 and March 2015, the proportion of antibiotic substances dispensed per 1000 population was 126Â·98 (95% CI 125Â·68-â€“128Â·27) and 131Â·25 (130Â·33â€) in the feedback intervention group. “132Â·16) control group 4Â·27 (3Â·3”; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0Â·967 [95% CI 0Â·957â€“0Â·977]; p<0Â· 0001), estimated 73 distributed ?406 represents fewer antibiotic items In December 2014, GP practices were reassigned to the patient-focused intervention (n=777) or control (n=804) groups Does not significantly affect the primary outcome measure between December 2014 and March 2015 (per 1000 population antibiotic items dispensed: 135Â·00 [95% CI 133Â·77–136Â·22] in the patient-focused intervention group and 98 [133Â·06–134Â·90] in the control group, IRR 1Â·01, 95% for difference between groups GA 1Â·00–1Â·02; p=0Â·105 Interpretation The high-profile messenger of social norm feedback can significantly reduce antibiotic p rewriting at low cost and at a national scale,” this result makes it a valuable addition to antimicrobial management programs.",1,1,

DESIGN Randomized, single-blind trial. SETTING Neonatal intensive care unit, North Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 200 mothers of babies are in a neonatal intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS Audio recordings of conversations with a neonatologist given or not given (n=102) to mothers (n=98). KEY OUTCOME MEASURES At day 10 and at 4 and 12 months, recall of information, attitudes and use of tape, satisfaction with conversations, postpartum depression, anxiety, general health, and parenting stress. RESULTS 91% (n=93) of mothers in the tape group listened to the tape (once at day 10, twice at 4 months, and three times at 12 months""; range 1-10). At four months, mothers in the patch group were 75% more likely to remember all treatment-related information than mothers in the control group (59% vs 34%; ""hazard ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.4). Six mothers, all in the control group, could not remember their speech. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of satisfaction with the conversations (10 days), postpartum depression and anxiety scores (10 days, four and 12 months), and parenting-related stress (12 months). CONCLUSION Providing voice recordings of conversations with a neonatologist to mothers of infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units increased their recall of information (up to four months). Recorded conversations did not affect mothers' well-being or satisfaction with the neonatologist. TRIAL REGISTRATION Australian Clinical Trials Registry 12606000478516.",0,0,

1499,Psychoeducation: improving outcomes in bipolar disorder,"BACKGROUND: A relevant paradigm shift in the treatment of bipolar disorder began a few years ago"";"" Important findings on the usefulness of psychological interventions clearly support the shift from a purely pharmacological therapeutic approach to a unified but hierarchical model in which pharmacotherapy plays a central role, but psychological interventions can help bridge the gap between theoretical effectiveness and ""real world"" effectiveness. . Here we review the effectiveness of several adjunctive psychotherapies in the maintenance treatment of bipolar patients. METHODS: A systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted using the MEDLINE and CURRENT CONTENTS databases. ""Bipolar"", ""Psychotherapy"", ""Psychoeducation"", ""Cognitive-behavioral"" and ""Relapse prevention"" were entered as keywords. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments specifically designed for the prevention of relapse in bipolar mood disorder, together with mood stabilizers, are useful tools. Most recently published psychotherapy studies report positive results on maintenance as adjunctive therapy and efficacy in the treatment of depressive episodes. Interestingly, several groups around the world reported similar positive results and achieved very similar results"";"" Almost every intervention tested includes important psychoeducational elements, including both enhancing compliance and early identification of prodromal symptoms – emphasizing the importance of lifestyle regularity – and exploring patients' health beliefs and disease awareness. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of psychotherapy for improving adherence and clinical outcomes of bipolar patients is currently unquestionable and future treatment guidelines should encourage its regular use among clinicians. As clinicians, it is our greatest mission to provide our patients with the best treatment available, and this includes both evidence-based psychoeducational programs and newer pharmacological agents.",0,0,
1500,Psychological and Behavioral Interventions for the Management of Insomnia Disorder: An Evidence Report by the American College of Physicians for Clinical Practice Guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Psychological and behavioral interventions are often used for insomnia disorder. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of psychological and behavioral interventions for insomnia in adults.

STUDY SELECTION: Randomized, controlled trials of psychological or behavioral interventions published in English and enrolled in adults with insomnia lasting 4 or more weeks. reviewer""; dual investigative assessment of risk of bias;"" Consensus determination of strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty studies with low to moderate risk of bias compared psychological and behavioral interventions with inactive controls or other psychological and behavioral interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) generally improved post-treatment global and most sleep outcomes compared with information or waiting list controls (moderate-strength evidence). Use of CBT-I improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low to moderate evidence). Multicomponent behavioral therapy improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low to moderate evidence). Stimulus control improved 1 or 2 sleep outcomes (low-powered evidence). The evidence for other comparisons and harms was insufficient to draw conclusions. LIMITATIONS: The wide range of comparisons has limited the ability to aggregate the data. Trials did not always report global results, and rarely did the sender or responder analysis. Comparisons were usually groups of information or waiting lists, and publication bias was possible. CONCLUSION: The use of CBT-I improves most outcomes compared to inactive controls. Multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control may improve some sleep outcomes. Other results, comparisons, and evidence for long-term efficacy were limited.",0,0,
1501,Psychological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder: recommendations for the clinician based on a review of the literature,"This article reviews current research data supporting the use of psychotherapy in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors highlight how this evidence can inform clinical choices in the treatment of PTSD and show how assumptions based on gaps in the current literature can be misleading. The authors first discuss the findings on a range of interventions commonly used in the treatment of trauma survivors or PTSD patients: critical-event stress interrogation, psychoeducation, exposure therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, stress inoculation therapy, trauma management therapy, cognitive therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and hypnotherapy. They also discuss a number of treatment strategies recently reviewed in PTSD, including imagery rehearsal, memory structure intervention, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. PTSD is associated with significant symptomatic morbidity, but desired outcomes in clinical practice typically relate to reductions in social, interpersonal, and occupational impairment. The most methodologically sound studies that typically examine cognitive or behavioral treatments show that psychotherapy helps alleviate symptom severity"";"" however, although these problems are often of greatest concern to patients, there is no consistent information on whether these interventions are helpful in improving other areas of impairment and related disability. Furthermore, the available evidence does not indicate when and for whom various psychotherapeutic interventions should be provided, or whether different treatment modalities can be combined or offered sequentially, as is often done in specific treatment programmes. Clinicians should keep these issues in mind when reviewing the literature on current (and future) clinical trials. Unfortunately, the available psychotherapy-based evidence for PTSD provides only limited guidance regarding clinical choices in the management of PTSD. Therefore, the authors provide some literature-based clinical guidelines for clinicians treating patients with PTSD.",0,0,
1502,Psychometric Analysis of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18V2 in Adolescent and Young Adult-Old CNS Tumor Survivors,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescent and young adult (FNA) central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors are an understudied population at risk of developing adverse health outcomes such as obesity. Long-term follow-up guidelines recommend monitoring those at risk for obesity, thereby motivating the need for an eating behavior questionnaire. A shortened online version of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18v2) has been developed, but its applicability to this population is not yet known. This study investigated the factor structure and reliability of the instrument in this universe. METHODS: AYA-aged CNS tumor survivors (n = 114) aged 15-39 years completed the TFEQ-R18V2 questionnaire online. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the relevance of the three-factor construct (uncontrollable eating, cognitive restriction, and emotional eating [EE]) and reliability (internal consistency of TFEQ-R18v2). Relationships between the three factors and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated by linear regression. RESULTS: The theorized three-factor construct was supported in our population (RMSEA = 0.056 and CFI = 0.98) and showed good reliability (0.81-0.93 alpha). EE (beta = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13) was positively associated with BMI, while the other two subscale scores were not. CONCLUSION: The TFEQ-R18v2 device shows promise for research and clinical use among AYA-aged CNS tumor survivors. The tool could be a useful tool for researchers to develop personalized weight management strategies. It can also be a valuable tool for clinicians to monitor and facilitate referral of survivors at risk of obesity. Our results also suggest that IE in this population should be further investigated as a potential target for intervention.",0,0,

A status sheet from the Cardiac Rehabilitation Division of the European Society of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the European Society of Cardiology,"Numerous empirical studies show that psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs) such as low socio-economic status, social isolation, stress, type D personality, depression and anxiety increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and also increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and prognosis in patients with CHD. PSRFs may also be a barrier to lifestyle changes and treatment compliance and may alleviate the effects of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). There also appears to be a bidirectional interaction between PSRFs and the cardiovascular system. Stress, anxiety, and depression affect the cardiovascular system through immune, neuroendocrine, and behavioral pathways. In contrast, CHD and related treatments can cause distress in patients, including anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, PSRFs can be assessed with single-item screening questions, standard questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews. Psychotherapy and medication may be considered to alleviate any PSRF-related symptoms and improve HRQoL, but there is insufficient evidence of a definitive beneficial effect on cardiac endpoints. A multimodal behavioral intervention, integrated counseling for PSRFs and coping with illness should be included in comprehensive CR. Patients with clinically significant symptoms of distress should be referred for counseling or psychologically focused interventions and/or psychopharmacological treatment. Consequently, the success of CR may critically depend on the interdependence of body and mind, and this interaction needs to be reflected through the evaluation and management of PSRFs in line with sound scientific evidence by trained personnel integrated into the core CR team.",0,0,

The Oncology Nursing Association has identified nursing intervention-sensitive outcomes known as nursing-sensitive patient outcomes. This article provides information on sleep-wake disorders in cancer patients and makes recommendations for evidence-based interventions to improve patients' sleep. Sleep-wake disorders occur in 30-75% of people with cancer and adversely affect other symptoms and quality of life. Despite the frequency and severity of sleep-wake disorders, limited research has tested interventions to improve sleep-wake outcomes. While no interventions currently receive the highest recommendations for practice, some non-pharmacological interventions show initial positive findings in promoting high-quality sleep and daytime functioning. Oncology nurses can screen for sleep-wake disorders and recommend specific interventions.

1507,Putting prevention into practice,"In primary medical care settings, disease prevention services are provided at lower rates than recommended. Also, practitioners tend to exaggerate their realization rate. There are essentially two steps in providing evidence-based preventive services: (1) knowing what the evidence is to perform various detection and response maneuvers, and (2) integrating preventive services into daily practice. The first is a scientific process and is conducted in Canada by the Canadian Task Force on Periodic Health Examination. However, after ten years of experience with evidence-based guidelines, we now know that guidelines are not enough. Integrating clinical prevention into intensive practice is a political and logistical process. This fact is best captured by the joke, ""An ounce of prevention requires a pound of office system change."" A number of studies have shown that continuing medical education (CME) courses and workshops for physicians are not sufficient to ensure clinical preventive services are incorporated into practice. According to Lomas, traditional CME education approaches need to be complemented by strategies that come from paradigms such as the social impact model, the innovation diffusion model, and the adult learning model. In his book ""From Science to Practice,"" Battista draws attention to the complexity of the communication process required to spread innovation into practice. Walsh's Model of Clinical Preventive Care Systems best captures the interactive factors that mediate practitioners' intentions and actions when it comes to delivering clinical prevention services. This article reports a practical example of helping family practitioners develop a ""sustainable office system in prevention"" that minimizes barriers, focuses energy, and integrates clinical prevention into office routines. Key components are (i) a practice coordinator for prevention, (ii) clear clinical prevention-related job descriptions for all patient caregivers, (iii) a prevention-enhancing information management system, and (iv) a practice feedback and problem-solving strategy.",0,0,
1508,Qualitative data collection and analysis methods: INSTINCT trial,"Patient care practices often lag behind current scientific evidence and professional guidelines. The failure of such knowledge translation (KT) efforts may reflect an inadequate assessment and management of certain barriers faced by both physicians and patients at the treatment level. Effective CC in this setting can benefit from the use of qualitative methods to identify and overcome these barriers. The qualitative methodology allows for an in-depth exploration of barriers to practice change adoption and has rarely been used in emergency medicine research. The authors describe the methodology for qualitative analysis in the INSTINCT (Increased Stroke Treatment Through Interactive Behavioral Change Tactics) trial. This includes processes for valid data collection and reliable analysis of textual data from focus group and interview transcripts. INSTINCT is a 24-hospital, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate a systems-based barrier assessment and interactive educational intervention to increase appropriate tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) use in ischemic stroke. Response hospitals undergo basic barrier assessment using both qualitative and quantitative (survey) techniques. Researchers obtain data on local barriers to tPA use, as well as information on local attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding acute stroke treatment. Targeted groups at each site include emergency physicians, emergency nurses, neurologists, radiologists, and hospital administrators. Transcript analysis using NVivo7 with a predefined barrier taxonomy is described. This will provide both qualitative information on thrombolytic use and the importance of specific barrier types for each site. Qualitative findings then guide professional education efforts and systems interventions in treatment areas.",0,0,
1509,Qualitative research within trials: developing a standard operating procedure for a clinical research unit,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative research methods are increasingly used in clinical research to address broader research questions than can be addressed by quantitative methods alone. These methods allow healthcare professionals, service users, and other stakeholders to contribute their insights and experience regarding the evaluation of healthcare treatments, interventions or policies and influence the design of trials. Qualitative data often contributes information that could change policy for the better or affect design. METHODS: Healthcare researchers, including trialers, clinicians and qualitative researchers, have worked collaboratively to develop a comprehensive portfolio of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the West Wales Society for Meticulous Research in Health (WWORTH), a clinical research unit (CTU) . At Swansea University, recently enrolled with the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC). While UKCRC requires a total of 25 SOPs from registered CTUs, WWORTH has chosen to add an additional qualitative methods SOP (QM-SOP). CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative methods SOP (QM-SOP) defines good practice in designing and implementing qualitative components of trials while providing flexibility in approach and method. Its basic principles are: qualitative researchers should contribute from the outset of studies with qualitative potential; the qualitative component should have clear objectives; and the main working publication should report on the qualitative component. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that CTUs consider developing a QM-SOP to improve the conduct of quantitative research by adding qualitative data and analysis. We conclude that this enhances the value of quantitative research and contributes to the future development of multi-method research.",0,0,

Methods Collaborative design of a quality score within the framework of the French clinical research project NosoQual. Feasibility and observational study in 46 surgical departments visited between November 2002 and March 2003 according to standard procedures. A bibliographic review followed by expert consultations, a field test, analysis, and a final reassessment leading to the definition of a consensus score. The results generated 138 variable scores. They were classified into seven dimensions, each representing a different aspect of quality of care in surgery. Scores were calculated for each section according to the threshold and weight attributed to each variable. The mean achievement level of scores ranged from 42% to 71% of theoretical maximums. The variability of scores on the seven dimensions was greater and significant than that expressed by the total score (coefficient of variation = 0.1). Conclusion This analytical study contributed to the design of a quality score for surgery. However, the progression of the score must continue to account for all observed barriers and meet the high requirements of the real patient safety issue.",0,0,

Improvement in review quality after intervention was modest and considered primarily medical rather than surgical wards. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: From a medical and legal point of view, the improvement was unsatisfactory as the indicators needed to reach 100% clarity and completeness. Another study is being carried out to increase the participation of health professionals so that such needs are perceived as a common goal, not just bureaucratic initiatives.",0,0,

1514,Quality of drug advertisements in medical journals: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Magazine advertisements are one of the main sources of drug information to physicians. Although there are regulations and controls on drug promotion around the world, the information on drugs provided in magazine advertisements has been criticized for being of poor quality in several studies. However, no attempt has been made to systematically summarize this research group. We designed this systematic review to evaluate all studies examining the quality of pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical and pharmaceutical journals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, web library, search engine and examining citations (1950 - February 2006). Only articles published in English that examine the quality of information contained in drug advertisements for prescription products in medical or pharmaceutical journals are included. For each eligible article, one researcher independently extracted data on study methodology and results. The data were then reviewed by a second researcher. Any disputes are resolved by consensus. The data were analyzed descriptively. The final analysis included 24 articles. The studies examined ads from 26 countries. The number of journals reviewed in each study ranged from four to 24 journals. Various outcome measures were examined, including testimonials and claims provided in advertisements, availability of product information, adherence to codes or guidelines, and presentation of risk results. Most of the studies used convenience sampling method. Brand name, generic name and indications are usually provided. Journal articles were widely cited to support pharmaceutical claims. Less than 67% of claims were supported by a systematic review, a meta-analysis, or a randomized control trial. In studies that evaluated misleading claims, there was at least one advertisement with a misleading claim. Two studies found that less than 28% of claims were conclusive clinical claims. Most advertisements with quantitative information provided risk results as relative risk reduction. Studies were conducted in only 26 countries, and in this case the generalizability of the results is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this review indicates that low-quality magazine advertising is a global problem. Ongoing efforts to increase education on drug promotion are crucial, as the information provided in magazine advertisements has the potential to change the prescribing behavior of physicians. The results of our review highlight the need for a global, proactive and effective regulatory system to ensure that the information provided in medical journal advertisements supports the quality use of medicines.",0,0,
1515,Quantitative comparison of cognitive behavioral therapy and music therapy research: a methodological best practice analysis to guide future research for adult psychiatric patients.,"Although the music therapy profession is relatively young and small, it can treat diverse clinical populations and has established a diverse research base. However, although the profession has arisen from working with people diagnosed with mental illness, there is a significant lack of quantitative research on the effects of music therapy on this population. Music therapy clinicians and researchers have reported on this lack of evidence and the difficulty of conducting psychosocial research on their interventions (Choi, 1997"";"" Silverman, 2003a). While published studies offer recommendations for future research, no study has provided detailed recommendations for the methodology and design of rigorous high-quality randomized controlled psychiatric music therapy trials. How do other psychotherapies acquire their database, and can the music therapy field borrow from their rigorous ""methodological best practices"" to strengthen its literature base? Therefore, since the National Institutes of Mental Health has indicated that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for evidence-based psychotherapy, aspects of this psychotherapy's literature base were analyzed. The purpose of this literature review is (a) to analyze and identify components of high-quality quantitative CBT research for adult psychiatric consumers, (b) to analyze and identify variables and other elements of quantitative psychiatric music therapy research available to adult consumers, and (c) with the mental health population. Compare the two datasets to identify the best methodological designs and variables for future quantitative music therapy research. To identify the key components of high-quality experimental research designs and the application of quantitative clinical trials, a table is included that analyzes randomized and comprehensive controlled trials involving the use of CBT for people with severe mental illness. The table also shows the same analyzed components for current quantitative psychiatric music therapy research with adult consumers, thus highlighting potential areas and elements for future research. A second table shows a range of potential dependent measures and their sources to be evaluated in future music therapy studies. A third table, which provides recommendations for future research, is derived from a synthesis of the tables and is included to guide researchers and encourage the advancement and expansion of the existing literature base. The body of the article is a discussion of literature analysis results from tables, meta-analyses, and literature reviews. It is hoped that this report will lead to the addition of future high-quality quantitative research to the psychiatric music therapy literature, thereby providing evidence-based services to as many people with mental illness as possible.",0,0,
1516,The pursuit of quality care and patient safety: the Singapore case,"Quality of care in Singapore has witnessed a paradigm shift from the traditional focus on structural approaches to a broader multidimensional concept involving monitoring of clinical signs and medical errors. Strong political commitment and institutional capacities have been key factors in making the transition happen. What is lacking, though, is a culture of rigorous program evaluation, public participation, and patient empowerment. Despite these shortcomings, Singapore has made significant strides, and its experience can teach lessons for other smaller developing countries in the common quest for quality care and patient safety.",0,0,
1517,Quetiapine supplementation for depression: a dosing model in routine practice,"This study investigated dosing patterns of quetiapine supplementation (QA) for major depressive disorder (MDD) in routine practice. Patients diagnosed with MDD who were taking QA with an ongoing antidepressant between January 1, 2009 and May 31, 2013 were included in this study. A total of 977 patients' electronic medical records and clinical data were reviewed for up to one year. Almost half of the patients continued their QA treatment for more than 3 months. The mean CG duration was approximately 6 months, and the mean initial and maintenance doses were 23.6 and 40.7 mg/day, respectively (range=12.5-400 mg/day). The most common adverse events observed were somnolence, followed by dry mouth and drowsiness. Our results suggest that in routine practice, actual QA doses for MDD should be lower than those used in placebo-controlled clinical trials and those recommended by a regulatory agency. Sufficiently robust and well-controlled prospective studies are needed to better understand the precise role of low-dose QA in the treatment of MDD, especially in routine practice.",0,0,
1518,Randomized controlled trial of a complex intervention by primary care nurses to increase walking in patients aged 60-74 years: PACE-Lift protocol (Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Assessment - Lifting) trial,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity is essential for older people to maintain physical and mental health and independence. Guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of activity per week, with at least moderate-intensity physical activity most days. The most common physical activity of the elderly is walking, if walking is light intensity, if it is brisk, moderate intensity. Less than 20% of 65-74-year-olds in the UK report meeting the guidelines, although most do. Effective behavior modification techniques include strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, building self-efficacy, and relapse prevention. Primary care physical activity consultations allow for individual tailoring of recommendations. Pedometers measure step counts and accelerometers measure physical activity intensity. This protocol describes an innovative intervention to improve walking in older people using behavior modification techniques, including pedometer and accelerometer feedback as part of a primary care nurse physical activity consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with intervention and control (usual care) arms plus process and qualitative assessments. PARTICIPANTS: 300 people aged 60-74, registered in 3 general practices in Oxfordshire and Berkshire West primary care foundations, can walk outside without any restrictions to increase their physical activity. INTERVENTION: 3-month pedometer and accelerometer-based intervention supported by practice nurse physical activity consultations. Four consultations based on behavior modification techniques, physical activity diary, average daily step-by-step steps, and accelerometer feedback on physical activity intensity. Individual physical activity plans will be produced based on increased walking and other available physical activities. RESULTS: Change in mean weekly daily steps (primary outcome) and mean time spent in at least moderate-intensity physical activity (secondary outcome) at 3 months and 12 months, as assessed by accelerometry. Other outcomes include quality of life, mood, exercise self-efficacy, injuries. Qualitative assessments will explore reasons for not participating in the trial, acceptability of the intervention by patients and nurses, and factors that hinder or increase the physical activity level of the elderly. CONCLUSION: The PACE-Lift trial will determine the feasibility and efficacy of an intervention to increase physical activity among elderly primary care patients. Steps taken and anticipated challenges to minimize bias will be discussed. Word number 341. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN42122561.",0,0,

DESIGN Factorial randomized trial. SETTING 64 General applications in the UK. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain""; 144 were randomized to normal care, 147 to massage, 144 to six Alexander technique lessons, and 144 to 24 Alexander technique lessons;"" half of each of these groups were randomized to prescribe exercise. INTERVENTIONS Normal care (control), six sessions of massage, six or 24 lectures on the Alexander technique, and exercise prescription from a doctor with a nurse provided behavioral counseling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Roland Morris disability score (number of activities impaired by pain) and number of days with pain. RESULTS Exercises and lessons in the Alexander technique, but not massage, remained effective at one year (compared to control Roland injury score 8.1: massage -0.58, 95% confidence interval -1.94 to 0.77, six lessons -1.40, -2.77 to -0.03) , 24 lesson -3.4, -4.76 to -2.03 and exercise -1.29, -2.25 to -0.34. Exercise after six lessons provided 72% of the effect of only 24 lessons (Roland disability score of -2.98 and -4.14, respectively). The number of days with back pain in the last four weeks was lower after classes (compared to control median 21 days: 24 lessons -18, six lessons -10, massage -7), and quality of life improved significantly. No significant damage was reported. CONCLUSIONS One-on-one lessons in the Alexander technique from registered teachers have long-term benefits for patients with chronic back pain. The six lessons followed by the exercise prescription were almost as effective as the 24 lessons. TRIAL REGISTRATION National Research Registry N0028108728.",0,0,

DESIGN Cost outcomes study and cost-effectiveness analysis at 12-month follow-up of a factorial randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain from primary care. INTERVENTIONS Six or 24 lessons in normal care (control), massage and Alexander technique. Half of each group were randomized to receive an exercise prescription from a doctor plus behavioral counseling from a nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs for the NHS and participants. Comparison of costs with Roland-Morris disability score (number of activities impaired by pain), painful days, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). NHS costs versus QALY earnings using incremental cost-effectiveness rates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS Intervention costs ranged from £30 for an exercise prescription to £596 for 24 lessons in the Alexander technique plus exercise. Healthcare costs ranged from £50 for 24 lessons in the Alexander technique to £124 for exercise. An incremental analysis of cost-effectiveness of single treatments showed that exercise offered the best value (£61 per point in disability score, £9 per additional pain-free day, £2847 per QALY gain). For the two-stage therapy, six courses combined with exercise in the Alexander technique were the best value (additional pound64 per point on disability score, pound43 per additional pain-free day, 5332 pounds per QALY gain). RESULTS In an exercise prescription and the Alexander technique alone, both six lessons were more than 85% likely to be cost effective at values above £20,000 per QALY, but the Alexander technique outperformed exercise in all outcomes. In Alexander technique classes, the combination of six lessons followed by exercises was the most effective and cost-effective option.",0,0,
1521,Randomized controlled trial of integrated care to reduce disability from chronic low back pain in work and private life,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated care program combining patient-directed and workplace-directed intervention for patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN Population-based randomized controlled trial. ENVIRONMENT Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals). PARTICIPANTS 134 adults aged 18-65 years were listed because of low back pain for at least 12 weeks. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to usual care (n=68) or integrated care (n=66). Integrated care consisted of a participatory ergonomics-based workplace intervention involving a supervisor and a gradual program of activities based on cognitive behavioral principles. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was time off from work (work disability) due to low back pain until return to full sustainable work. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity and functional status. RESULTS The median time to return to sustainable employment was 88 days in the integrated care group compared to 208 days in the regular care group (P=0.003). Integrated care was effective in returning to work (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8, P=0.004). After 12 months, patients in the integrated care group had significantly greater improvement in functional status compared with patients in the usual care group (P=0.01). The relief of pain did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION The integrated care program has significantly reduced disability due to chronic low back pain in private and work life.

1522,Randomized controlled trial of adapted strategies to implement guidelines for the management of patients with depression in general practice.,"BACKGROUND: Various methods are available to implement changes in the clinical behavior of general practitioners (GPs). While passive dissemination is generally ineffective, other methods can be variably effective. Few studies have investigated the effect of adapted methods. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether methods designed to overcome barriers to change using psychological theories are more effective than dissemination alone in the implementation of depression guidelines among GPs. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sixty general practices in the UK""; 30 GPs in the control group, 34 GPs in the intervention group. METHODS: Practitioners identified patients presenting with depression before and after the implementation of the guidelines (control group n = 192 at first data collection, n = 181 at second; first intervention group n = 210 at data collection and n = 197 in the second. The main outcome measures were: record of adherence to guideline recommendations in clinical records;"" Proportion of patients with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score less than 11 at 16 weeks after diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with control group Compared to the general practice group, there was an increase in the proportion of patients evaluated for suicide risk in the group of GPs in the private practice group. In the intervention group, the proportion of patients with a BDI score below 11 at 16 weeks increased. CONCLUSION: Barriers to implementation can be identified and strategies can be adapted.

1523,Randomized controlled trial to change hospital management of unstable angina,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the benefits of a guideline-based education program to improve the management of unstable angina pectoris (UAP) in hospital patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. LOCATION: 37 public hospitals across New South Wales. PATIENTS: 1,872 patients admitted with the diagnosis of UAP between February 1 and June 30, 1996 (baseline questionnaire), and 1,368 patients admitted with the same diagnosis between July 1 and December 31, 1998 (follow-up questionnaire). INTERVENTION: Training sessions led by local opinion leaders, providing guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council on the management of UAP, and providing feedback on local practice using data from the baseline survey. Sessions were held between March and June 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of evidence-based practice determined by medical record review. RESULTS: Beta blocker use increased in intervention and control hospitals, but the increase was significant only in the first. The use of calcium channel blockers has decreased significantly in both intervention and control hospitals. However, the variation in drug use between baseline and follow-up did not differ significantly between intervention and control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some favorable changes in drug use for the management of UAP between 1996 and 1998, there was no evidence that a guideline-based education program was beneficial in changing management. This reaffirms the challenge of changing doctors' behavior through practice guidelines. Alternative methods should be considered to promote evidence-based practice.",0,0,

NSAIDs). Design Randomized clinical trial of 1963 clinicians assigned to an intervention group that received a customized electronic stimulus requiring a positive response, or to a control group that received a commercially available passive stimulus as part of the CPOE. The study period was from August 2, 2006 to December 15, 2007. Measures Stimulus compliance were compared between study groups. Results The proportion of requested order responses (ie, not reordering the alert-triggering drug after firing) was lower in the intervention group (114/464 (25%) customized alert issued) compared to the control group (154/560 (28%). ) passive alerts firing). The adjusted OR for the non-conforming rank was 1.22 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Outcome A customized CPOE warning requiring a provider response had no effect in reducing co-prescription of NSAIDs and warfarin beyond the commercially available passive warning received by the control group.

Adapting a validated, cost-effective intervention to cancer treatment may offer a viable solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy of protocol-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia by oncology nurses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, controlled, pragmatic, two-center study of CBT versus usual therapy (TAU) in 150 patients (103 women""; mean age, 61 years) who completed active breast, prostate, colorectal, or gynecologic cancer Study CONSORT Primary outcomes were sleep diary measures at baseline, post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary measures of actigraphic sleep, health-related quality of life (QOL), psychopathology, and fatigue. CBT consisted of five small group sessions over consecutive weeks after a manualized protocol. TAU represented normal clinical practice; appropriate control for clinical efficacy study. RESULTS: CBT was associated with a mean reduction in wakefulness of 55 minutes per night compared to no change in TAU. These results persisted 6 months after treatment. Difficulty initiating sleep, nocturnal sleep deprivation standardized for complaints of waking and sleep efficiency (percentage of time spent sleeping in bed) The work-relative effect sizes were large. CBT was associated with moderate to large effect sizes for five of the seven QOL outcomes, including significant reduction in daytime fatigue. There were no significant interaction effects between any of these results and baseline demographic, clinical, or sleep characteristics. CONCLUSION: CBT for insomnia can be both clinically effective and applicable in real-world practice.",0,0,

This trial tested the efficacy of a minimal intervention targeting multiple health behaviors (diet, physical activity, alcohol, and smoking) over one year in a general practice setting through the provision of personalized, computer-tailored feedback. METHODS: Patients who had been to a general practitioner in the past 6 months were recruited from 21 GPs in Brisbane, Australia. Baseline data were collected using self-reports on adherence to ten health behaviors and summarized with a health score between 0 and 10. This randomized controlled trial used a 2x2 factorial design with an arm that randomized subjects to either the intervention or control group. The other arm was either baseline feedback (single contact) or an additional assessment at 3 months with feedback (dual contact). Accordingly, 4 study groups were formed and participants were randomized blindly: A. Single-contact intervention""; B. Dual-contact intervention; C. Single-contact control and D. Double-contact control. All participants were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Of 4676 randomly selected participants 3065 completed the questionnaires at 12 months Both the single and dual contact groups improved their 10-item health scores (+0.31 and +0.49, respectively) compared to the control group results (+0.02; p< 0.01. Fish intake in the single and double contact intervention groups, consumed Improvement was observed in adherence to guidelines for dairy type, fruit and vegetable intake, and alcohol intake (p<0.01). Both intervention groups individually showed greater improvement than controls. Red meat intake, smoking behavior, physical activity, and health excluding body weight Interestingly, there was an improvement in reported non-smoking rates in both the intervention and control groups I (3% single contact; ""4.5% dual contact). RESULTS: Low density Small but significant long-term changes in health behaviors can be achieved with a common intervention, which, when applied on a large scale, can reduce health care costs. More research is needed to better understand the mechanism by which behavior change can be sustained. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12611001213932.",0,0,
1529,Randomized controlled training and feedback trial for implementation of guidelines for acute low back pain,"OBJECTIVE: The impact of clinical guidelines on resource use for complex conditions with significant barriers to clinician behavior change is not well studied. We report the impact of a multifaceted guideline intervention intervention on primary care clinicians' use of radiological and specialty services for the treatment of acute low back pain. DESIGN: Physician groups were randomized to receive mentoring and individual feedback supplementing patient education materials, or both or neither. Adherence to the guideline and impact on resource use were assessed during the 12-month period before and after implementation. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen physician groups consisting of 120 primary care physicians and associate practitioners from 2 groups of model HMO practices. INTERVENTIONS: A training/supervision/feedback model was used with local peer opinion leaders in the implementation of the directive. The patient education component included written and videotaped materials on the management of low back pain. KEY RESULTS: Clinician intervention was associated with an absolute increase of 5.4% in behavior consistent with the guideline in the intervention group and a 2.7% decrease in the control group (P =.04). The patient education intervention produced no significant change in behavior consistent with the guideline, but was poorly adopted. Patient characteristics, including duration of pain, previous history of low back pain, and number of visits during the illness episode were strong predictors of service use and behavior consistent with the guideline. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the training and feedback-supported acute low back pain care guideline for primary care clinicians was associated with an increase in behavior consistent with the guideline. Patient education materials did not increase the effectiveness of the guideline. Implementation barriers may limit the usefulness of this approach in usual care settings.",0,0,
1530,Randomized controlled trial on cardiovascular risk management by practice nurses supplemented by self-monitoring in primary care,"UNLABELED: BACKGROUND: Treatment goals for cardiovascular risk management are often not achieved. Specialized practice nurses are making the work of general practitioners increasingly easy, and self-monitoring devices have been developed as a counseling aid. The aim of this study is to compare standard treatment with self-monitoring-assisted standard treatment administered by clinical nurses and standard treatment without self-monitoring in terms of cardiovascular risk and separate risk factors. METHODS: At least one treatable risk factor (smoking, hypertension, lack of physical activity, or overweight) without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes but with a Score >/= 5% 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality was randomized into two groups. The control group received standard treatment according to the guidelines, while the intervention group also received proactive counseling and self-monitoring (pedometer, scale, and/or blood pressure device). The effect on 179 participants after one year of treatment was analyzed. RESULTS: SCORE risk assessment decreased 1.6% (95% CI 1.0-2.2) for the control group and 1.8% (1.2-2.4) for the intervention group, with the difference between groups being 0.2% (-.6-1.1). Most risk factors tended to improve in both groups. The intervention group had higher number of visits and longer visits (4.9 (SD2.2) vs. 2.6 (SD1.5) visits p< .001 and 27 (P25 -P75:20-33) vs. 23 (P25 -P75) :19-30) min/visit p= .048). CONCLUSION: After one year of treatment by GPs, cardiovascular risk was significantly reduced in both groups.

DESIGN: A two-arm randomized trial lasting 12 months. SETTING: Italian general practitioner services. Subjects A total of 3,186 men and women aged 18-65 years were admitted to the medical service by their general practitioner. INTERVENTIONS: The Italian Guide to Proper Nutrition, an educational intervention dating back to 1998, and a brochure on the basics of healthy eating. The aim of the main study was to provide more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Follow-up visit every 6 months. The main outcome measures Weight, blood pressure, and the 40-item Food Frequency Questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a slight decrease in net meat intake and a slight increase in net intake of fruit and vegetables, fish products and olive oil. Body mass index (BMI) changed only in the treatment arm [-0.41 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.11 to -0.53]. Net change in the intervention arm at 1 year was +1.31 (CI 0.90-4.39) for fruit and vegetables and -0.22 (-0.11 to -0.69) (portions per week) for meat. We also calculated a 'healthy eating score' reflecting adherence to recommended dietary habits. In the intervention group, the mean score at recruitment was significantly lower than the mean score at the end of follow-up (Coarse score change = 0.29""; CI 0.19-0.48). . When comparing the intervention with the control group, the difference in score from baseline to last visit was statistically significant (P < 0.001) (MANOVA adjusted for gender, BMI, education, and time). CONCLUSIONS: A brief educational intervention by GPs can result in multiple dietary changes that can lower BMI and potentially reduce the risk of chronic disease in generally healthy adults.",0,0,

1534,Randomized study of a clinical decision support system: impact on the management of children with fever without an apparent source.,"Purpose: To evaluate adherence to a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the diagnostic management of children with fever without an obvious source, and to examine the effects of CDSS implementation on the time spent in the emergency room (ED) and the number of laboratory tests. Design: CDSS was used by emergency care personnel to enroll children presenting with fever. The CDSS identified children who met the inclusion criteria (1-36 months and fever without apparent source (FWS)) and provided patient-specific diagnostic management advice. Children at high risk of serious bacterial infection were randomized to the 'intervention' (n _x0001_ 74) or 'control' (n _x0001_ 90) group. In the intervention group, the CDSS recommended that laboratory tests be ordered immediately, and in the control group, the emergency room doctor first evaluated the children and then decided to order laboratory tests. Results: Compliance with the enrollment of children with fever was 50% (683/1,399). Adherence to the recommendation to request laboratory tests was 82% (61/74). Children in the intervention group had a median (25-75th percentile) length of stay in the emergency department of 138 (104-181) minutes. The median length of stay in the emergency room in the control group was 123 (83–179) minutes. Laboratory tests were requested significantly more frequently in the intervention group (82%) than in the control group (44%, p 0.001, _x0001_2 test). Conclusion: The implementation of a CDSS for the diagnostic management of young children with fever of no apparent origin was successful in terms of adherence and adherence to CDSS recommendations, but had unexpected effects on patient outcomes in terms of length of stay in the emergency department and number of laboratory tests. Existing CDSS has been discontinued.",1,1,
1535,Randomized trial of model predictive control for improved anemia management,"Background and targets: The variable hemoglobin (Hb) response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may have adverse consequences. The utility of model predictive control for drug dosing has been demonstrated previously. Design, setting, participants, and measures: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to test the model predictive control for erythropoietin dosing in ESRD patients. The trial included 60 hemodialysis patients randomized to a treatment arm (30 subjects) receiving erythropoietin doses according to computer recommendations, or to a control arm (30 subjects) receiving erythropoietin doses based on recommendations from a standard anemia management. protocol (control). Subjects were followed for 8 months, and target ratios of measured Hb within the target of 11 to 12 g/dl and outside the target of 9 to 13 g/dl were measured. The variability of the Hb level was measured by the area under the Hb curve as well as the absolute difference between the obtained Hb and the target Hb of 11.5 g/dl. Results: Model predictor control, 15 observations >13 or <9 g/dl (outliers), a mean absolute difference of 0.98 ± 0.08 g/dl and Hb between achieved Hb and 11.5 g/dl resulting in the area under the curve. 2.86 ± 1.46. The control group algorithm resulted in 30 Hb outliers (P = 0.051), producing a mean absolute difference between the obtained Hb and 11.5 g/dl, an area of 1.18 Â± 0.18 g/dl (P < 0.001 difference in variance) and below.

1536,Randomized trial of problem-based and didactic seminars to disseminate evidence-based guidelines on asthma management to primary care physicians,"INTRODUCTION: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the efficacy and satisfaction of small group problem-based learning (PBL) versus a didactic lecture approach to guideline dissemination in the treatment of asthma by controlling for confounding factors common in comparative education interventions. METHODS: Places were selected as lessons or PBL using simple randomization. All participants were exposed to similar educational resources to ensure treatment equivalence. Tools included standardized program/speaker evaluation forms and a case-based questionnaire validated with a visual analog scale measuring the confidence level of responses. The second was presented immediately before and after the intervention and 3 months later. The statistician was blind to intervention groups. RESULTS: A total of 52 family physicians agreed to attend, 23 of them PBL sessions (mean 4.6 per group) and 29 didactic lecture sessions (mean 7.25). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of knowledge gained in each test application. Participants rated the lecturer or facilitator equally as having created a positive learning environment. PBL participants rated the perceived educational value of the program as higher than course participants (4.36 vs. 3.93"";"" p = .04). Both groups experienced a significant increase in knowledge about asthma after the intervention. Attrition rates for the 3-month posttest were 14% for PBL participants versus 32% for course-based participants. CONCLUSION: PBL was as effective as course-based continuing medical education (CME) programs in acquiring and retaining knowledge. Further studies are warranted to explore whether the higher educational value assessment or the increase in delayed test response rate is reproducible in other RCTs that address common confounders and whether these factors influence future CME participation, changes in physician clinical behavior, or patient health outcomes.",0,0,
1537,Randomized trial to improve prescribing safety in ambulatory elderly patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a computerized tool that alerts pharmacists when new potentially unsuitable drugs are prescribed to patients 65 years of age and older is effective in reducing the proportion of patients prescribing these drugs. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: US healthcare organization. PARTICIPANTS: All 59,680 health plan members aged 65 and over were randomized to intervention (n=29,840) or usual care (n=29,840). Pharmacists received alerts on all patients randomized to a targeted drug newly prescribed intervention. INTERVENTION: Prescription and age information was associated with alerting pharmacists when a patient aged 65 and over was newly prescribed one of 11 drugs potentially unsuitable for older people. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians and pharmacists collaborated to develop the targeted drug list, the indications for drug use where the intervention should occur, intervention guidelines and scenarios, and implement the intervention. RESULTS: During the 1-year study, 543 (1.8%) intervention group patients aged 65 years and older were newly issued prescriptions for targeted drugs, compared with 644 (2.2%) usual care group patients (P=.002). For indications of drug use in which an intervention should occur, amitriptyline (P<.001) and diazepam (P=.02) distributions were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a computerized pharmacy alert system and collaboration among healthcare professionals in reducing potentially inappropriate drug dispensing in elderly patients. Combining the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists with data from information systems can improve prescribing safety in patients aged 65 and over.",1,1,
1538,"Randomized, controlled trial of the efficacy of simulation training: A 24-month follow-up study in a clinical setting.","BACKGROUND: The knowledge and skills of ICU nurses to follow evidence-based guidelines to avoid complications associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation are currently limited. We hypothesized that a single simulation training session would lead to longer-term higher skill levels among ICU nurses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Finland between February 2012 and March 2014. Thirty of the initially randomized critical care nurses participated in a 24-month follow-up. -up work. Behavior and cognitive development were assessed through a validated Ventilator Pack Observation Schedule and Questionnaire at baseline and repeated 3 times during simulation and real-life clinical settings. RESULTS: After simulation training, the mean skill score increased from 46.8-58.8% of the total score at the final post-intervention measurement (Ptime < .001, Ptime x group = .040, and Pgroup = .11). The mean knowledge scores within the groups did not change significantly. The mean difference between groups in skill scores was significant only at 6 months (P = .006). RESULTS: ICU nurses' ability to adhere to evidence-based guidelines improved over time in both groups, but improvements between study groups were significantly different at only 6 months and were no longer evident 2 years after a single simulation training.",0,0,
1539,Rapid change in prescribing behavior at hospitals that joined the guidelines after clinical trial results of management of atherothrombosis (MATCH) with clopidogrel in high-risk patients were released,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite published randomized trials and consensus guidelines, physician prescribing patterns are slowly changing. Treatment of Atherothrombosis in High-Risk Patients (MATCH) In the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke Program with Clopidogrel, we measure the impact on discharge prescribing patterns in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack. METHODS: We analyzed the discharge prescribing patterns of antithrombotic drugs for patients presenting with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack to hospitals participating in the GWTG-Stroke between October 2002 and January 2006. Quarterly clinical information regarding publication of the MATCH trial was analyzed. The frequency of aspirin+clopidogrel prescribing after MATCH was compared with the pre-MATCH period after adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics and clustering by hospital. RESULTS: A total of 107,872 patients were discharged from 632 centers and were eligible for antithrombotic therapy. Use of aspirin+clopidogrel therapy decreased from 22.4% to 15.4% of patients after publication of MATCH (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.70, P<0.0001). The quarterly analysis revealed a rapid and sustained reduction in the use of aspirin+clopidogrel therapy for the remainder of the study period. RESULTS: In the absence of MATCH-specific GWTG-Stroke interventions and prior to an American Heart Association guideline update, a rapid and sustained reduction in the frequency of aspirin+clopidogrel use was observed in ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack after the publication of the MATCH study.",0,0,
1540,Rational prescribing in primary care (RaPP): economic evaluation of an intervention to improve professional practice.,"Background Interventions designed to narrow the gap between research findings and clinical practice can be effective but also costly. Economic considerations are necessary to decide whether such interventions are worth the effort. We evaluated the economic implications of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The specific intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial and was shown to significantly increase thiazide use in patients starting antihypertensive drug therapy, but with little or no effect on other outcomes. The increased use of thiazides was not expected to have an impact on health outcomes. Methods and Findings We performed cost minimization and cost-effectiveness analyzes on data from a randomized trial involving 146 general practices from two geographic regions in Norway. Each treatment was randomized to either the specific intervention (70 treatments""; 257 physicians) or the control group (69 treatments;"" 244 physicians). Only patients who were started on antihypertensive drug therapy were included in the analyses. A multi-pronged intervention was designed to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with supervision and feedback, and computerized reminders. Pharmacists visited. A cost minimization framework was adopted in which intervention costs were set against declining treatment costs (mainly due to the increased use of thiazides rather than more expensive drugs). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as the additional cost per patient initiated on thiazides. The net annual cost (cost minimization) in our study population was $53,395, corresponding to $763 per application. The additional cost per patient (cost-effectiveness) initiated on thiazides was US$454. The net annual savings in a national program are modeled after 2 years at US$761,998 or US$540 per implementation. In this scenario, savings exceeded costs in all but two of our sensitivity analyzes and cost-effectiveness was estimated at $183. Conclusions In our study, we found a significant shift towards thiazide use in prescribing antihypertensive drugs. An important reason to encourage the use of thiazides is their lower price compared to other drugs. The cost of the intervention was more than double the savings over the time frame of our study. However, we foresee modest savings over a 2-year period.",0,1,
1541,Rationale and Design of the Study to Evaluate the Effect of Cardiovascular Drugs Provided as Low-Cost Evidence-Based Generic Examples (SAMPLES),"BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular drugs are often underused, leading to increased overall drug costs and cost mismatch. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate an intervention to promote appropriate generic cardiovascular drug use without creating administrative or financial barriers that could hinder essential drug use. TRIAL DESIGN: SAMPLES (Study of Evaluation of the Effect of Cardiovascular Medicines Provided as Low-Cost, Evidence-Based Generic Samples) trial is a clustered, randomized controlled trial of the effect of providing physicians with free generic hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin for hypertensive patients. for patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomly select 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, clustered by physician practice, with or without free samples for both conditions. We will use data on filled prescriptions from a government-sponsored prescription drug assistance program to perform a therapeutic assessment of the intervention's impact on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of generic prescriptions) and patient compliance. Secondary outcomes will include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs. CONCLUSION: This trial will identify the potential role of an innovative approach to promote clinically cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic samples can reduce overall drug costs as well as patient out-of-pocket costs without sacrificing efficacy, and whether this approach provides a better fit for core cardiovascular drugs. This intervention can also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If effective, this strategy could be widely used by private insurers or government payers to promote more cost-effective and higher quality care.",0,0,
1542,Causes and consequences of poor adherence to standard measures by the nursing team,"Standard precautions (SPs) are recommendations to prevent infection and protect healthcare workers during the delivery of care, but there is still a low level of adherence to these recommendations. Purpose To analyze the causes and consequences of poor adherence to standard precautions by maintenance personnel. Method integrative literature search, search seven databases from 2005 to 2014. Results 30 articles were selected for analysis. The reasons for proven low compliance are related to inadequate lifelong learning practices, risky behavior of employees, inadequate equipment and protective equipment supply, and inadequate working conditions. The consequences are accidents and occupational diseases. There are few intervention studies that guide professionals only. Conclusions Low adherence to standard measures is linked to individual aspects of workers, employers and educational institutions. Intervention strategies employed have shown little effectiveness by focusing solely on the employee.",0,1,

1545,Recent Trends in Violent Behavior of High School Students in the United States,"Context Violent behaviors such as fighting and carrying weapons are associated with serious physical and psychosocial consequences for adolescents. The goal is to measure trends in non-fatal violent behavior among adolescents in the United States between 1991 and 1997. Design, Environment and Participants Nationally representative data from the 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys were analyzed to define the percentage of students. Those who engage in violent behavior in grades 9 to 12. Overall response rates for each of these years were 68%, 70%, 60% and 69%, respectively. Logistic regression analyzes were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of time trends for these variables, controlling for gender, grade, and race or ethnicity and simultaneously evaluating linear and higher-order effects. Main Consequence Measures Self-reported carrying weapons, physical combat, combat-related injuries, feeling unsafe, and damaged or stolen property. Results Between 1991 and 1997, the percentage of students engaged in physical fights decreased by 14%, from 42.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.1-44.9%) to 36.6% (95% CI, 34.6%-38.6%) . ""; the percentage of students injured in a physical fight decreased by 20% from 4.4% (95% CI, 3.6%-5.2%) to 3.5% (95% CI, 2.9%-4%, 1); gun carrying decreased 30%, from 26.1% (95% CI, 23.8-28.4%) to 18.3% (95% CI, 16.5-20.1%). Between 1993 and 1997, the percentage of students carrying guns decreased by 25%, 7.9% (95% CI, 6.6-9.2%) to 5.9% (95% CI, 5.1%-6.7%); 16% of students engaged in physical fights on school property; decreased from 2 to 9% (95% CI, 15.0-17.4%) to 14.8% (95% CI, 13.5-16.1%);"" and the percentage of students carrying guns on school property decreased by 28% from 11.8% (95% CI, 10.4-13.2) to 8.5% (95% CI, 7.0-10.0%) fell. All these changes represent significant linear decreases. Results The decline in fighting and carrying weapons among US adolescents between 1991 and 1997 is encouraging and is consistent with decreases in homicide, non-fatal victimization, and school crime rates. Further research should explore why interpersonal violence-related behaviors are declining and what types of interventions are most effective.",0,0,
1546,Recommendations for community-based treatment of depression in older adults,"OBJECTIVE: To present recommendations to public health and aging networks for the community-based treatment of advanced age depression. METHODS: An expert panel of mental health and public health researchers and community-based practitioners on aging convened in April 2006 to create consensus-based recommendations. When making recommendations, panelists evaluated the feasibility and relevance for community-based delivery, as well as the strength of evidence for program effectiveness from a systematic literature review of articles published up to 2005. at home or in primary care clinics. The panel recommended individual cognitive behavioral therapy. Interventions not recommended as primary treatment for advanced age depression included education and skills training, comprehensive geriatric health assessment programs, exercise, and physical rehabilitation/occupational therapy. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations for various categories of interventions, including group psychotherapy and psychotherapies other than cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: While recognizing the challenges and barriers involved, this interdisciplinary panel of experts determined that proposed interventions should be mainstreamed in public health and aging networks. Interventions that were not recommended or lacked sufficient evidence generally did not primarily treat depression and/or did not include a clinically depressed sample while attempting to establish efficacy. These interventions may provide other benefits, but they should not be assumed to effectively treat depression alone. Panelists also described primary prevention of depression as a poorly studied area. These findings should assist individual clinicians as well as public health decision makers in the delivery of population-based mental health services in a variety of community settings.",0,0,
1547,Multi-model sensors recommendations service for the chronically ill patient in the home environment,"With the advanced technologies at hand, there are potential applications and services created around monitoring the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly in nursing homes. Most of the elderly in these facilities suffer from different chronic diseases such as dementia. Current technologies mainly focus on non-drug interventions and monitoring of ADL to address loss of autonomy or well-being. Monitoring and managing ADL related to cognitive behaviors for non-drug intervention is very effective in improving the condition of people with dementia. However, patients' cognitive functions can be improved if appropriate medication recommendations are given at a given time. We have previously developed Secure Wireless Sensor Network Integrated Cloud Computing for Ubiquitous-Life Care (SC(3)). SC(3) services were limited to monitoring the ADL of older people with Alzheimer's disease and providing non-drug advice to the patient. In this paper, we propose a system called Intelligent Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an integral part of the SC(3) platform. With Smart CDSS, patients are provided with access to drug recommendations from specialist physicians. Physicians are provided with an interface to generate clinical information for drug recommendations and to monitor the patient's condition. As the knowledge base of Smart CDSS, clinical information generated by physicians generates recommendations for medications to the caregiver based on each patient's symptoms.",0,0,
1548,Recruiting hospitalized patients for research: How do participants differ from non-eligible participants?,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence for guidelines and interventions. Still, most of the eligible population refuses to be examined. OBJECTIVE: To identify differences between participants and eligible non-participants in (1) perceived stress, (2) self-efficacy, (3) recovery prospects, (4) discussion of advanced directions, and (5) understanding of a standard prescription label (health literacy). Design: Quasi-experimental prospective cohort study in 5 acute care hospitals. METHODS: We approached 295 hospitalized patients who were recruited for a behavioral intervention and asked them to answer 5 screening questions. We matched respondents' responses to behavioral intervention acceptance and Medicare claims and enrollment data. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare approval rates based on screening question responses. ENVIRONMENT/PATIENTS: Medicare patients paid per inpatient service. RESULTS: Patients were less likely to consent to behavioral intervention when they reported that they had low expectations of recovery when they felt that they could not control important things in their life (odds ratio [OR]: 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.92). (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.45) or mixed with any other question (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05-0.24). Conversely, individuals who incorrectly answered the drug question were more likely to consent to the behavioral intervention (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.12-13.03). There were no significant differences in the consent of patients who reported feeling overwhelmed or discussed prior care planning with family members or doctors. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized non-eligible participants differ in constructs related to perceived stress, recovery expectation, and health literacy. Recognition of such features can inform strategies to improve hospital response reception and representation in clinical trials.",0,0,

1550,Relapse after surgical treatment of Hidradenitis suppurativa,"Six to 89 months after surgery, 82 patients treated with radical surgery (118 excisions) for resistant hidradenitis suppurativa were reviewed. Local recurrence rates varied widely by disease site, with low after axillary (3%) and perianal surgery (0%), and high after inguinoperineal (37%) and submammary excision (50%). Recurrence is due to inadequate excision or an unusually wide distribution of apocrine glands, but physical factors such as obesity, local pressure, and skin maceration played a role in a few patients. Relapse due to inadequate surgery tended to be the most troublesome. In the follow-up, 75 (91%) of the patients were satisfied with the results of their operations. A quarter of patients developed disease in a new anatomical region after surgery. Radical surgery provides good symptomatic control of severe hidradenitis suppurativa of the axilla, inguinoperineal and perianal regions, but is less satisfactory for submammary disease.",0,0,

DATA SOURCES: This article presents data from major evidence-based studies and clinical trials that describe the extent of the problem, the rationale for risk reduction, and a patient-centered action plan for NPs to effectively manage cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: NPs are active partners of the National Diabetes Education Program and play a key role in efforts to effectively manage cardiovascular risk factors in people with diabetes and increase their awareness of the link between diabetes and heart disease and stroke. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION: The action plan to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes will help NPs implement the most effective management strategies for medical nutrition therapy, physical activity and pharmacological therapy, which are essential for patient-centered proactive management of hyperglycemia, hypertension and lipid. abnormalities",0,0,
1553,Reducing the amount of blood transfused: a systematic review of behavioral interventions to change physicians' transfusion practices.,"BACKGROUND: Transfusion services have used a variety of techniques to reduce blood product use. Given the potential adverse effects of transfusions and the resources consumed in implementing strategies to reduce transfusions, there is a need to understand their effectiveness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to reduce blood product use. METHODS: We identified all relevant articles through electronic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as manual searches of review articles and personal files. Electronic searches included articles published between January 1966 and May 2003. Searches included the terms blood transfusion, plasma exchange, guidelines, education, practice patterns, and professional practice. Outcomes of interest were the number of units transfused and the proportion of patients transfused. RESULTS: Nineteen studies examining the efficacy of single (guidelines, prospective controls, retrospectives, and reminders) or multiple interventions in reducing red blood cell, platelet, plasma, cryoprecipitate, and albumin transfusions met inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies showed a relative reduction in the number of units delivered (range, 9-77%) or the proportion of patients who received transfusions (range, 17-79%). The reported reductions were qualitatively similar for the different blood products studied. No specific intervention or combination of interventions appeared more effective in reducing use. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral interventions, including simple interventions, appear to be effective in changing physician transfusion practices and reducing blood use. Appropriately designed clinical trials are still needed to determine the relative effectiveness of different interventions to change practice.",0,1,

When the question is about drinking alcohol, what advice would be appropriate? While moderate intake may be beneficial for cardiovascular and bone health, drinking more than the recommended amount increases the risk of harmful effects. This column reviews guidelines for moderate alcohol consumption for women, reviews the evaluation process, and shows a brief example of an intervention. A screening, brief intervention, and referral program (called SBIRT by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) should be part of the standard assessment for every woman. Ongoing assessment of alcohol consumption can help better target behavior for early intervention.",0,0,
1555,"Reducing excessive therapeutic injection use through patient-prescriber interactive group discussions in the Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Inappropriate prescription of injections has been reported in developing and developed countries. Previous studies in Tanzania have shown that more than 70% of patients admitted to outpatient clinics in private dispensaries receive at least one injection per consultation; this is higher than the WHO recommended 10% target. This is worrisome given the potential negative effects of using unsafe syringes to transmit HIV, hepatitis B and C, polio, and the additional economic impacts on the patient and the healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Interaction Group Discussion on behavior change on injection prescribing practices in ten selected public dispensaries in the Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Patient records of injection prescriptions covering the period three months prior to the study were obtained from 5 randomly selected controls and 5 randomly selected intervention sites. In each healthcare facility, mothers and prescribers were administered IGDs for one month, followed by a survey 3 months after IGD to determine the effect of IGDs. Chi-square statistical calculations were performed to compare data on the percentage of prescriptions with an injection prescribed between baseline and 3-month follow-up and that met national standard treatment guidelines (STG). The results showed no significant difference between the percentage of injectable prescriptions prescribed at baseline in state dispensaries and 3-month follow-up (P>0.05, X2 test). Prescribed injections consistent with STG were low at baseline and did not improve significantly after 3 months (P>0.05, X2 test). Comprehensive studies and sensitization of adherence to STG are recommended by prescribers.",0,0,
1556,Reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia rates through a staff training program,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients and causes increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and costs. Preventive measures for VAP are well documented and evidence-based, but continue to be poorly implemented in most intensive care units. We conducted a pre- and post-intervention observational study to evaluate whether an educational program focusing on preventive practices for VAP could reduce the incidence. Six hundred and seventy-seven adult patients who were mechanically ventilated for >48 hours were included in the study population. An evidence-based guideline for bedside preventive practices has been developed and distributed to ICU staff. The incidence rates of VAP before and after the implementation of the training program were compared. VAP infection rates ranged from a mean of 13.2+/-1.2 in the pre-intervention period to 6.5+/-1.5/1000 device days in the post-intervention period (mean difference 6.7""; ""95% CI: 2.9-10.4, P=0.02). A multidisciplinary training program for intensive care unit personnel can successfully reduce VAP incidence rates. More studies will be needed to assess the impact on broader outcome measures such as costs or mortality.",0,0,
1557,Reduction of lower extremity clinical abnormalities in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. A Randomly Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a patient, healthcare provider, and systems intervention on the prevalence of risk factors for lower extremity amputation in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. DESIGN: Blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Academic general medicine practice. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 395 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes who underwent initial patient evaluation, 352 completed the study. INTERVENTION: The 12-month intervention was multifaceted. Patients received podiatry training and entered into a behavioral contract for their desired foot care, reinforced by phone and postcard reminders. Health care providers were provided with practice guidelines and information flowcharts on foot-related risk factors for amputation in diabetic patients. In addition, folders for intervention patients had specific descriptors that required healthcare providers to 1) ask patients to remove their shoes, 2) conduct foot exams, and 3) provide podiatry training. RESULTS: Patients receiving the intervention were less likely than control patients to have severe foot lesions (baseline prevalence, 2.9%""; odds ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.16 to 1.00]; P = 0.05) and other dermatological abnormalities. were more likely to self-report podiatry behaviors, have foot exams during office visits (68% vs. 28%; P < 0.001), and receive podiatry training from healthcare providers (42% vs. 42%) 18%; P < 0.00 0.001) Physicians assigned to intervention patients were more likely to examine patients for ulcers, pulses, and abnormal dermatological conditions and refer patients to a podiatric clinic than physicians assigned to check-in (10.6% versus 5.0%);"" P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: An intervention designed to reduce risk factors for lower extremity amputations positively affected patient self-foot care behavior and foot care provided by healthcare providers, and reduced the prevalence of lower extremity clinical disease in patients with diabetes.",0,0,
1558,Referral for fertility preservation counseling in female cancer patients,"STUDY QUESTION: What changes can be detected in fertility preservation (FP) counseling (FPC) over time, and what are the predictors associated with referral of newly diagnosed female cancer patients aged 0-39 years to a reproductive medicine specialist for FPC? ? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although the absolute number of patients receiving FPC has increased over time, only 9.8% of all potential patients (0-39) were referred in 2011, and referral differences were found in terms of patients' age, cancer diagnosis, and healthcare provider. -related factors. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Referral rates for FPC prior to initiating gonadotoxic cancer treatment are low. Determinants associated with low referral and referral disparities have been identified in previous studies, but only scarce data are available on determinants for referral practices and FPC referral in FP(C) reimbursed environments. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We conducted a retrospective observational and survey study in a Dutch university hospital. The data of all female cancer patients (2001-2013) who were given FP counseling in this center and all newly diagnosed female cancer patients aged 0-39 in the region (2009-2011) were collected. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, INSTALLATION, METHODS: Data were drawn from medical records (FPC patients), cancer cases reported by the Dutch Cancer Registry (to calculate referral percentages) and referring professionals (to determine reasons for current referral behavior). KEY OUTCOMES AND ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 9.8% of patients were referred for FPC in 2011. Patients aged 20-29 years or diagnosed with breast cancer or lymphoma were referred more frequently than patients under 20 years of age or patients diagnosed with other malignancies. The absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time. The healthcare provider predictors for miscarriage were not starting a discussion about fertility-related issues, not knowing where to refer a patient for FPC, and not collaborating with patient associations. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Actual referral rates may differ slightly from our estimate as there may be patients who do not wish to receive FPC. Sporadically, patients may have been referred directly to other sites or have received ovarian transposition without FPC. By excluding skin cancer patients, we would underestimate the group of women eligible for FPC, as this group includes melanoma patients who may have received gonadotoxic therapy. WIDE IMPACT OF THE FINDINGS: The low referral rates and referral disparities reported in the current study suggest opportunities to improve referral practices. Future research should focus on the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve referral practices, such as informational materials for patients in oncology departments, discussion prompts, or ways to increase physician and patient awareness of AP techniques and guidelines.

1562,Rehabilitating antisocial personalities: treatment through self-management strategies,"It is commonly assumed that offenders with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) refuse psychotherapeutic intervention. Thus, some commentators argue that those with this disorder are better managed in the criminal justice system, where engagement with psychological treatment following the introduction of indefinite sentences is forcibly linked to achieving parole. In contrast, National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines on the management and treatment of ASPD recommend that treatment seekers should be considered for admission to specialist psychiatric hospitals. The rationale is that prison-based interventions are under-resourced and ASPD treatment is not given enough priority. The rationale is that offenders with ASPD can be rehabilitated if they are motivated. One problem, however, is that little is known about why offenders with ASPD receive treatment or what effect subsequent treatment has on their understanding. The purpose of this article is to address these unresolved issues. Based on the findings of an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)-funded qualitative study examining the experiences of male convicted male offenders admitted to a specialist personality disorder ward on medium security property and the medical doctors who treat them. The data are analyzed with reference to Michel Foucault's work on governmentality and strategy in power relations. Two arguments have been advanced: first, criminals with ASPD are motivated by legal coercive pressures to employ a variety of Foucault-type strategies to give a false impression of treatment progress. Second, and related treatment, does not lead to changes in self-understanding in the resistant client with ASPD. This assumes that, at least for this group, Foucault was wrong in his claim that resistant behaviors only mask the effectiveness of treatment norms over time. However, the article concludes that specialist treatment in a hospital setting may affect changes in the resistant offender's self-understanding, but completion of treatment does not result in his readmission to prison, as is usual.",0,0,
1563,Rehabilitation of children and adolescents,"significant increase in the majority of chronic mental and physical diseases among children and adolescents has been reported in recent years. Therefore, medical child and adolescent rehabilitation plays an important role. Therefore, early diagnosis and multimodal intervention in childhood and adolescence are necessary to prevent a chronic disease course. Patient education programs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic diseases. These programs mostly aim to improve adaptive behavior and disease management. Then health status and quality of life should be improved. The quality of rehabilitation programs has been improved over the past 15 years due to the implementation of the guidelines and evaluation work. However, future research should develop flexible rehabilitation programs (rehabilitation period, rehabilitation near or far from the place of residence, inpatient, partial outpatient and outpatient programs and rehabilitation chain), whose effectiveness should be proven in particular.",0,0,
1564,Successfully treated anxiety and fear relapse: theoretical considerations and recommendations for clinical practice.,"Despite the existence of effective interventions for anxiety disorders, relapse – or return of fear – poses a significant long-term challenge for patients and clinicians. This article draws on the experimental and clinical behavioral literature, reviewing the mechanisms by which fear reversal may occur. The aim of the article was to create a list of treatment recommendations for clinicians aiming to reduce relapse in successfully treated anxiety disorders. The clinical and experimental literature on the mechanisms of regeneration, reinstatement, self-healing, and recovery is reviewed. These are linked to the clinical and experimental literature on the return of fear in successfully treated anxiety. A list of recommendations is provided to help reduce the likelihood of relapse in successfully treated anxiety. This list includes methods of use in the behavioral (exposure) treatment of anxiety disorders aimed at improving clinical outcomes. Despite a significant relapse problem in successfully treated anxiety, there are methods available to reduce the likelihood of relapse through fear return. Clinicians dealing with the treatment of anxiety disorders should pay attention to these methods to ensure optimal patient outcome.",0,0,
1565,The relationship between reporting completeness of health research and journal approval of reporting guidelines: systematic review.,"PURPOSE To assess whether the completeness of reporting health research is relevant to journals' approval of reporting guidelines. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Reporting guidelines from a published systematic review and the EQUATOR Network (October 2011). Studies evaluating the completeness of reporting using a reporting guide (called ""reviews"") (1990 - October 2011""; additional searches in January 2012) included from searches of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Methodology Register or Scopus, depending on reporting English or French language assessments of included reporting guidelines are included, which provide clear guidance for reporting, describe the guidance development process, and specify the use of a consensus development process. potentially appropriate assessments, including DATA DRAWING The guides used were first scanned as titles and abstracts, and then as full-text reports. If eligibility was uncertain, review authors were contacted; When necessary, the websites of the journals were consulted for approval information. Completeness of reporting of reporting guidelines was analyzed in relation to item-by-item validation and a mean overall score when consistent with the authors' analysis. RESULTS 101 reporting guidelines included. Of the 15,249 records from the assessment search, 26 assessments were identified that evaluated the completeness of reporting on the approval of nine reporting guidelines. Of these, 13 assessments evaluating seven reporting guidelines (BMJ economic checklist, CONSORT for damages, PRISMA, QUOROM, STARD, STRICTA and STROBE) can be analyzed. Reporting guidelines were evaluated by several assessments. RESULTS (excluding CONSORT) Of the 101 health research reporting guidelines, the completeness of reporting only nine was evaluated in relation to the validation of journals. The items in the seven reporting guidelines were analyzed quantitatively, each with several assessments. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relationship between journals' approval of reporting guidelines and the completeness of reporting of published health research reports. Journal editors and researchers should consider collaborative prospective, controlled studies to provide more robust evidence.

1566,reminiscence therapy for dementia,"BACKGROUND: Recall Therapy (RT) has been defined as a vocal or silent recollection of events in a person's life, alone or with another person or group. It usually includes group meetings, at least once a week, in which participants are encouraged to talk about past events, often supplemented by helpful tools such as photos, music, objects, and videos from the past. Consistent application of psychological therapies in dementia services is often minimal. Some of these 'therapies' have been enthusiastically received by health care practitioners in stimulating care settings. They were expected to work miracles, and their ""failure"" led to their not being widely used. A systematic review of the available evidence is important to determine the effectiveness of different treatments. Then, guidelines for their use can be made on the basis of solid evidence. OBJECTIVES: RT involves groups of older people talking about past events, supported by tools such as videos, pictures and archives, to communicate and reflect on their life experiences. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the effects of RT for dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, EMBASE, OMNI, BIDS, Dissertation Abstracts International, SIGLE and related articles' reference lists up to 1998 and contacted experts. We also manually searched relevant websites and the Aging and Mental Health, Gerontologist, Journal of Gerontology, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, Current Research in Britain: Social Sciences, British Psychological Society conference proceedings and Reminiscence database. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials for RT for dementia in elderly people. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated research quality. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were included in the review, but only one study with 15 participants had extractable data. The results were not statistically significant for both cognition and behavior. STUDY MANAGER's RESULTS: No firm conclusions could be drawn about the effectiveness of RT for dementia. The review highlighted the urgent need for more systematic research in the region.",0,0,
1567,"Remission, residual symptoms, and unresponsiveness in the usual treatment of major depression in managed clinical practice","BACKGROUND: While published guidelines recommend continuing treatment for depression until complete remission of symptoms and restoration of functioning, little is known about how often remission is achieved in usual practice and what factors lead to discontinuation when treatment outcome is not optimal. METHODS: A native study design examined 1859 patients treated for DSM-III-R major depression between 1995 and 1997 in the national provider network of a managed behavioral health organization (MBHO). Symptom and disorder ratings were used by clinicians to group patients into complete remission, partial remission, and no response. Damage data were used to characterize treatment and identify comorbid medical conditions. RESULTS: Based on clinician ratings, approximately 27% to 39% of patients achieved complete remission. Medical and substance use comorbidity and hospitalization were more common in those with partial response to treatment. Only half of the patients with no treatment response received a drug trial during their treatment. Patient selection was the most common reason for discontinuing treatment, but approximately 40% of clinicians agree with patients' decisions even when symptoms do not improve. CONCLUSION: Although rates of complete remission are comparable to those in clinical trials of antidepressants, results suggest that clinicians may fail to recommend continuation and maintenance therapy in accordance with best practice guidelines, and failed therapy often does not include antidepressant drugs.",0,0,

1570,NIH Panel Report Defining Principles of HIV Infection Treatment*,"Recent research advances have led to a significantly better understanding of the biology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the advent of sensitive tools to monitor HIV replication in infected individuals, the risk of disease progression and death can be accurately assessed and the efficacy of anti-HIV treatments directly determined. Also, when used appropriately, combinations of newly available, potent antiviral therapies can affect long-term suppression of detectable levels of HIV replication and counteract HIV's natural propensity to generate drug-resistant viral variants. However, as antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has become more and more effective, it has also become increasingly complex. Familiarity with the latest research advances is necessary to ensure that new available treatments are used in a way that most effectively improves the health and prolongs the life of people infected with HIV. To enable practitioners and people infected with HIV to make the most of the rapidly accumulating new knowledge about the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV disease, the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research sponsored the NIH Panel to Define Principles of HIV Infection Treatment. This Panel was asked to describe the key scientific principles that should be used to guide the most effective use of antiretroviral therapies and viral load testing in clinical practice. Based on a detailed review of the most recent data, the panel identified eleven principles that address issues of fundamental importance for the treatment of HIV infection. These principles provide the scientific basis for specific treatment recommendations made by the Clinical Practices Panel for Treating HIV Infection, supported by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Reports from both of these panels are presented in this publication. Together, they summarize new data and provide both the scientific basis and specific guidelines for the treatment of HIV-infected persons.

1571,Reproductive rights and the medical care system: an advocacy for rational health policy.,"In recent times, there have been many challenges to women's reproductive rights and liberties: ""court-ordered cesarean section""; criminal cases against women for prenatal child abuse; and attempts to limit midwifery, home birth, and alternative birth operations. In these cases, medicine has taken up the behavior of pregnant women or the health care has been complicit or proactive in their attempts to control their choices. A more coherent policy framework is needed to guide the role of medicine as an agent of social control, the medical restructuring of problems that are social in nature, and the practice of physicians;"" PIP: Reproductive issues are highly controversial. Women's legal right to abortion continues to be questioned, women's rights are challenged by fetal rights, and there are concerns about early pregnancy, the appropriate use of reproductive technology, and the use of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy. However, little attention has been paid to the role of medicine as an agent of social control and arbiter of reproductive behavior, the medical restructuring and intervention of problems that are social in nature, or the role of equity and social justice in reproductive health care. The authors discuss these latter issues in light of historical and more recent attempts to control the behavior of pregnant women. In the absence of current reproductive health policy, the medical profession makes arbitrary decisions in individual cases that may or may not reflect the wishes of the patient or community. A more coherent policy framework and regulatory mechanisms are needed to guide physician practice. The authors discuss the issue in the context of context, key questions, social discrimination in reproductive health care, the choice of which services to provide, coercion and choice, and reproductive health policy as a solution.",0,0,
1572,Requiring physicians to respond to computerized reminders improves their adherence to preventive care protocols.,"Purpose: To improve compatibility with computer-generated reminders to perform stool occult blood testing (FOBT), mammography, and cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. Design: A six-month prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: Academic primary care general internal medicine practice. Subjects: Thirty-one general internal medicine faculties, 145 residents, and 5,407 patients with scheduled visits eligible for any of the three cancer screening protocols. Intervention: Primary care teams of internists and faculty received either routine computer reminders (check) or the same reminders to circle one of four responses: 1) “made/ordered today”, 2) “not applicable to this patient” ” 3) “patient declined” or 4) “next visit”. Results: Intervention physicians adhered more frequently than control physicians by combining all reminders (46% versus 38%, p=0.002), and FOBT (61% versus 49%, p=0.0007) and mammography (54%, respectively). vs 47%, p=0.036) separately with reminders, but not for cervical Pap testing (21% vs. 18%, p=0.2). Intervention assistants responded to FOBT and mammography reminders together and separately to all reminders significantly more frequently than control residents, but did not give a Pap test. There was no significant difference between intervention and control faculty, but the compliance rate for control faculty was significantly higher than the proportion of control residents for all reminders together and separately for FOBT, but not for mammography or Pap testing. The impact of the intervention was greatest for 70-year-old patients and yielded significant results for all tests combined and alone, not for residents but not faculty. Intervention physicians felt that reminders could not be implemented in 21% (due to insufficient data in patients' electronic medical records) and stated that 10% of patients refused. Conclusions: Requiring physicians to respond to computer-generated reminders improved adherence to preventive care protocols, particularly in older patients with the lowest compliance by control physicians. However, 100% compliance with cancer screening reminders will not be achieved due to missing data and patient rejection.",0,1,

From nine CLAHRCs across the UK This article summarizes the core theory adopted by the CLAHRC-NDL and its application as a case example that can be generalized to practice outside of CLAHRC compared to alternative practice models. Discussion Traditional approaches to health research often produce evidence that is isolated from the environment for which it is intended. The premise of the CLAHRC-NDL model is that barriers to implementation can be overcome if knowledge is co-produced by academic and clinical service staff, taking into account the organizational context in which it will be applied. This approach is based on organizational learning theory, recognizing that change is a social and political phenomenon. Evidence is produced in real time, taking into account the entire environment in which it will be applied. To support this process, senior healthcare personnel are assigned to CLAHRC as Â¡Â®diffusion scholarsÂ¡Â¯ (DFs) to actively bridge the research practice gap as full members of both the research team and their clinical field. application. Existing communities of practice are developed and new ones encouraged around specific themes to facilitate innovation and embed change in the local health community. Our approach has been adopted by 16 clinical research studies in mental health, children and youth, primary care, and stroke rehabilitation. Summary The CLAHRC-NDL implementation model applies organizational learning theory, addressing social and situational barriers and factors that facilitate implementation, and adopting a co-production philosophy. Two key mechanisms have been used for translation of innovation: DFs to actively bridge research into the practice gap, and communities of practice to support and sustain improvements in healthcare.

1578,"Investigation of effective approaches to cleanliness in hospitals: protocol of the REACH trial, a multisite cascade randomized trial.","Background The Study of Research into Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) will produce evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a new cleaning initiative aimed at improving the environmental cleanliness of hospitals. The initiative is an environmental sanitation package consisting of five interconnected, evidence-based components (education, technique, product, inspection and communication) implemented with environmental services personnel to improve hospital sanitation practices. Methods/design The REACH trial will use a cascade randomized controlled design to test the study intervention, an environmental cleanup package, in 11 Australian hospitals. All trial hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own controls, with analysis of the change in each hospital based on data collected during the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomly selected to one of 11 response times in 2016 with staggered start dates and a response time of 20 to 50 weeks. All sites are completing trial at the same time in 2017. Inclusion criteria allow for a purposeful sample of both public and private hospitals with higher risk patient populations for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (target) is the number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections per 10,000 bed days per month. Secondary outcomes for the primary objective include the completeness of hospital cleanliness assessed using fluorescent sign technology, the bioburden of frequently touched surfaces after cleaning, and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes regarding environmental cleanliness. A cost-effectiveness analysis will identify the second key result (second objective): the increased rate of cost-effectiveness resulting from the implementation of the cleaning package. The study uses the Action to Promote Research Practice in Healthcare (iPARIHS) framework to support the specific implementation of the environmental cleanup package at each hospital. Discussion Evidence from the REACH study will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines regarding hospital sanitation. It will be used by healthcare leaders and clinicians to inform decision-making and implementation of best practice infection prevention strategies to reduce HAIs in hospitals.",0,0,

The use of caregiver-initiated humor as an intervention in healthcare settings has both physiological and emotional benefits. However, little has been written about another very important aspect of humor, patient-initiated humor. When patients use humor to relieve feelings of stress, uncertainty, or embarrassment, they try to communicate with their caregivers. This use of humor by patients is not a way of ""illuminating"" the situation, but rather a way of reducing their sense of dehumanization. Humor is an interactive sharing process and an important aspect of communication. Patients will observe the caregiver for a response. A clear, accepting response shows you understand"";"" However, a negative or blank response may serve to isolate the patient.

PARTICIPANTS: With at least one relevant clinician (GP or nurse) and Intervention: This complex intervention was designed using evidence-based practice in learning and change in clinician behavior and general practice systems, and included best-practice approaches to motivate change in adolescent risk-taking behaviors. The intervention included training of clinicians (nine hours) in health risk screening, use of a screening tool. and motivational interviewing; training all practice staff (receptionists and clinicians) on youth participation; providing feedback to clinicians on patients' risk data; and two practice visits and referral resources to support new screening Comparative clinicians received a didactic training The m seminar (three hours) was included in youth and health risk screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were (1) the patient's report that the clinician identified at least one of six health risk behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, sexually transmitted infection risks, STIs, unplanned pregnancy, and route risks); and (2) change in one or more of the six health risk behaviors at three months or 12 months. Secondary outcomes were probability of future visits, trust in clinician after exit interview, clinician's perception of emotional distress and fear and abuse in relationships, and emotional distress at three and 12 months. Patient acceptability of the scan tool for the intervention arm is also described. Analyzes were adjusted for practice location and billing type, patients' gender, age, and method of recruitment, and, where appropriate, past health risks. Intent-to-treat analysis approach involving multilevel multiple assessment was used for missing outcome data. RESULTS: 42 treatments were randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison arms. The two intervention practices were withdrawn post-allocation before training, leaving 19 interventions (53 clinicians, 377 patients) and 21 comparators (79 clinicians, 524 patients). 69% of patients in both the intervention (260) and comparison (360) arms completed 12 months of follow-up. Intervention clinicians discussed more health risks per patient (59.7%) than comparative clinicians (52.7%) and were therefore more likely to identify a higher proportion of youth with at least one of the six health risk behaviors (38.4% versus 26.7%). , risk difference [RD] 11.6%, Confidence Interval [CI] 2.93% to 20.3%; adjusted odds [OR] 1.7, CI 1.1 to 2.5). Patients experienced less illicit drug use (RD -6.0, CI -11 to -1.2; OR 0.52, CI 0.28 to 0.96) and a lower risk of STIs (RD -5.4, CI -11 to 0.2; OR 0.66, CI 0.46 to 0.96). ) reported ) at three months for intervention relative to the comparator arm and at 12 months for unplanned pregnancy (RD -4.4; CI -8.7 to -0.1; OR 0.40, CI 0.20 to 0.80). Health risks More abuse detection (OR 13.8, CI 1.71 to 111) There were no reports of harmful events, and the intervention arm highly accepted the youth screening tool. Better detection of risky behaviors Had insufficient impact on health outcomes Technology that enables more efficient, systematic health risk screening could allow providers to target counseling to higher-risk individuals.

1584,Results of a physician and respiratory therapist joint effort to develop the long-term metered dose inhaler technique in the pediatric asthma clinic,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, asthma remains the chronic condition most responsible for absenteeism and pediatric hospitalizations. This is especially true for inner-city children. We operate an inner-city Pediatric Asthma Adaptation and Technique (PACT) clinic where doctors and respiratory therapists collaborate to improve metered dose inhaler (MDI) technique and outcomes among children with asthma. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of our MDI technique and strategy to improve asthma outcomes. METHODS: Children referred to the PACT clinic underwent a standardized assessment based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Expert Panel Guidelines. Clinicians demonstrated and reinforced correct MDI technique at each visit. Demographic data, MDI-technical scores (MDI steps performed correctly"";"" scale 0-8), pulmonary function, and asthma severity (NHLBI classification), using a standard format that we prospectively collected at the patient's first visit (T1) and most recent visit (T2) scale: 1 = mildly intermittent to 4 = severe persistent). Statistical analyzes were performed using parametric and non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Fifteen of 60 patients admitted to the PACT clinic between 1999 and 2002 were excluded from the study due to incomplete data enrollment. The mean time from T1 to T2 was 11.8 +/- 9.5 months. At T1 and T2, mean MDI technique scores were 53% and 81%, mean overall asthma severity scores were 2.6 and 2.3, and mean overall pulmonary function severity scores were 2.4 and 2.1. MDI-technical scores improved significantly between TI and T2 (p < 0.001). Black patients had the greatest improvement in MDI technique (p < 0.001), but pulmonary function test results, overall asthma severity, and pulmonary function severity did not improve significantly. White patients significantly improved both MDI techniques (p = 0.004) and overall asthma severity scores (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: In our PACT clinic, children with asthma showed sustained improvement in the MDI technique, and some of the patients showed improvement in respiratory function and overall asthma severity score.",0,0,
1585,Results that matter: Structured and unstructured self-monitoring of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a component of diabetes management. SMBG provides information on current glycemic status and provides the ability to receive immediate feedback on the effect of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on glucose levels. However, SMBG is only useful when the glucose information is properly understood, the data interpreted correctly, and the results prompt appropriate therapeutic actions. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has recently published guidelines for the use of SMBG in people with diabetes who are not insulin-treated, recommending that SMBG be used only when patients and/or clinicians have the ability and willingness to incorporate SMBG monitoring and therapy adjustment into their treatment. diabetes care plan If SMBG is used, the IDF also recommends that structured SMBG be done using defined regimens to meet individual needs. Structured SMBG can be performed as daily glucose profiles that represent daily glucose excursions. Measuring pre-meal/post-meal blood glucose (bG) levels on consecutive or alternating days (""testing in pairs"") also provides effective glucose information for daily diabetes management. This article reviews recent studies that have appropriately used structured SMBG as an integral component of comprehensive diabetes management and discusses how their findings support IDF recommendations. Our goal is to help clinicians make more informed decisions about the value and utility of SMBG in diabetes management.",0,0,
1586,"Rethinking pragmatic randomized controlled trials: introducing the ""cohort multiple randomized controlled trial"" design","Pragmatic trials are important for informing routine clinical practice, but current designs have shortcomings. Clare Relton and colleagues outline the design of a new ""multiple randomized controlled trial"" design that could help address issues associated with current approaches. The ""gold standard"" for determining how well an intervention is working. However, trials that aim to determine the efficacy of a treatment using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design (i.e., explanatory trials) are sometimes criticized. For example, while the design of exploratory trials results in strong internal validity—we can rely on the results of a particular trial—such trials may have limited external validity: Don't be sure we can apply the results to routine clinical practice. Pragmatic trials,12 aimed at informing healthcare decision-making in practice, have been proposed as a solution because they preserve the rigor of randomization (thus eliminating selection bias) but retain features of normal clinical practice. Implementation and interpretation of both pragmatic and explanatory randomized controlled trials are associated with significant problems. This article describes a trial design that helps address these issues - the ""cohort multiple randomized controlled trial"" approach. Current clinical trial designs may have shortcomings in four areas: ""recruitment""; ethics; patient preferences;"" and treatment comparisons. ### Recruitment Most randomized controlled trials have difficulty recruiting enough patients. For example, one study found that less than a third of the 114 multicenter, publicly funded UK studies received the original target number of patients within the time specified at baseline.3 Failure to meet the target may have implications for the power and generalizability of the study results. In addition, many clinical trials exclude hard-to-reach groups and ethnic minorities4, resulting in disparities between the “need (reference)” population and the trial population.5 6 â‚¬ ¦",0,0,

The reason for the controversy is clear. As with adult research, a balance must be struck between two goals: promoting children's health through advances in scientific knowledge and protecting children's research subjects from exploitation and harm. However, due to their age and relative immaturity, children cannot protect their own interests as much as adult subjects. As they progress into adulthood, however, increased care must be taken to involve children in decisions that affect them enough to allow them to make choices that can have serious and long-term consequences.",0,0,

One of America's best-known doctors at the time, Cabot practiced medicine in an age where science was redefining medical practice and thought. Despite being a champion of medical science, Cabot's primary concerns were clinical and humanistic. He emphasized the importance of outpatient medicine, advocated group practice, founded hospital social work, conducted clinical epidemiological research, lobbied for preventive medicine, formed the Clinical-Pathological Conference, and wrote extensively on medical ethics. In 1912, despite Cabot's great talents, the top professorship at Harvard Medical School was given instead to David Edsall, a clinician with a more extensive basic science training. Cabot's efforts to define the physician's role in human well-being as well as the healthcare system heralded the current attempts by medicine to emphasize the patient's social context.",0,0,

1596,Risk communication in clinical research: a cognitive experiment and a questionnaire,"BACKGROUND: A Royal Statistical Institute Working Group recently recommended that ""more numerical definitions as opposed to verbal risk definitions should be used"" in initial human clinical trials. This echoed the views of many clinicians and psychologists on risk communication. As the clinical research industry rapidly expands worldwide, it is important to understand risk communication in Asian countries. METHODS: We conducted a cognitive experiment on participation in a hypothetical clinical trial of a pain medication and a survey in cancer and arthritis patients in Singapore. In part 1 of the experiment, patients were informed about the risk of adverse events in one of three formats (frequency, percentage, and verbal descriptor) and one of two sequences (least to most severe and most to least severe). They were asked if they were willing to participate. In part 2, patients were informed about risk in all three formats in the same order and asked if they were willing to participate again. Immediately afterwards, a preference survey was conducted for risk presentation methods and the use of verbal descriptors. RESULTS: Willingness to participate and possibility of change of decision were not affected by risk presentation methods. Most patients preferred the frequency format, but patients with no primary school graduate or formal education were indifferent. While patients used the verbal descriptors ""very common"", ""common"" and ""very rare"" in a manner similar to the European Commission Guidelines, their use of ""uncommon"" and ""rare"" descriptors differed significantly from that in the EU. CONCLUSION: In this sample of Asian cancer and arthritis patients, the risk presentation format had no effect on willingness to participate in a clinical trial. However, there is a clear preference for the frequency format. The ordinary use of verbal identifiers differed significantly from that of the EU.",0,0,
1597,"Risk Factors for Methotrexate-Induced Lung Injury in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Multicenter, Case-Control Study","BACKGROUND: Toxicity limits the use of methotrexate. OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for methotrexate-induced lung injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Case-control study. MEDIA: One private and five academic rheumatology practices. PARTICIPANTS: Methotrexate recipients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without lung injury. MEASUREMENTS: Potential risk factors examined were sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, medical history, clinical and ancillary features, and characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis treatment and methotrexate treatment before methotrexate treatment. Cases of lung injury were defined according to the modified criteria of Searles and McKendry. RESULTS: Ninety-four percent of the study participants were white and 67% were women. Case patients (n = 29) were older than controls (n = 82) (61.5 vs. 54.5 years). After adjusting for other variables, the strongest predictors of lung injury were advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 5.1 [95% CI, 1.2 to 21.1]), diabetes (OR, 35.6 [CI, 1.3 to 21.1]). infinite]), was rheumatoid. pleuropulmonary involvement (OR, 7.1 [CI, 1.1 to 45.4]), previous use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR, 5.6 [CI, 1.2 to 27.0)), and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 19.5 [CI, 3.5 to 109.7]).

1599,Risk prevalence and screening for cancer by general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: This study presents the cancer risk prevalence and screening rates of patients admitted to GPs. Conditions covered include smoking, skin cancer, Pap smears, clinical breast exams and mammography. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 7,160 patients aged 18-75 years attending 230 GPs in a metropolitan and rural area in Queensland, Australia was used. The prevalence of risk was assessed from patients' self-reports of risk behavior and from screening prior to consultation. The details of the preventive care provided at the consultation are based on the doctors' own statements at the end of the consultation. RESULTS: 27 percent of men and 23 percent of women were smokers, with these rates being highest in younger age groups. According to national guidelines, there was no prior screening as recommended for men and women: skin cancer screening -- 66% of men, 70% of women"", cervical cancer screening -- 27%, clinical breast exam -- 45%; "" mammography -- 75%. These patients were thus categorized as ""at risk"" and the screening rates for these patients at the consultation were as follows: smokers -- 34%""; skin cancer -- 5%; cervical cancer -- 16%; mammography -- 4%;"" clinical breast examination -- 8%. CONCLUSIONS: According to national guidelines, a significant number of patients admitted to general practitioners were at risk of developing cancer. Of these, only a small proportion of all groups received preventive intervention by their families at the consultation described in this study.

METHODS: In 1999, the Piedmont Region Administration identified risk factors in the general population, particularly disadvantaged groups. Cardiologists played a primary role in supporting the evidence project to produce based guidelines, bibliographic reviews, and disseminate coronary risk maps To promote a lifestyle counseling system with the central reference of general practice activity a main trainer group was established in each Local Health Service. As a second step, a mass media campaign was created using health advertisements in newspapers, television, public transport, bulletin boards on: nutrition, hypertension, tobacco, physical hand activity, stress; warehouses, food markets, trains and squares took place. In addition, a bulletin review has been published since January 2000 to produce key models, the most effective interventions, and recommendations for their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: New attention has been paid to general practitioners' primary prevention and counseling arguments, as well as the need for continuing education to encourage preventive action. A system has been established to identify the best channels, means of communication and the most effective messages for a healthy life. To better plan and evaluate effective interventions, a model was established to identify social differences, monitor risk factor changes and protective behaviors in the population.

1601,The role of 'external facilitation' in applying research findings: A qualitative assessment of facilitation experiences in the Veterans Health Administration.,"Background Facilitation has been identified in the literature as a potentially important component of successful practice. However, it is neither well defined nor well studied. Important questions remain about the operational definition of facilitation and its relationship to other interventions, particularly when used in multifaceted implementation projects. Researchers, part of the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), are actively exploring a variety of approaches and processes, including facilitation, to ensure that best practices are implemented in the Veterans Health Administration healthcare system Â¨C, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. This document describes a systematic, retrospective assessment of practice-related facilitation experiences within QUERI, a quality improvement program developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods A post-hoc assessment was conducted through a series of semi-structured interviews to examine the concept of facilitation in several multisite QUERI practice studies. The interview process is based on a technique developed in the field of education that systematically enhances learning through experience by promoting recall and reflection on past complex activities. An iterative content analysis approach based on a set of conceptually based interview questions was used for data analysis. Findings The findings suggest that facilitation within a practice effort initiated by a central change agency is an intentional and valuable interactive problem-solving and support process that emerges in the context of an acknowledged need for improvement and a supportive interpersonal relationship. Facilitation was primarily defined as a distinct role with a potentially important set of behaviors and activities. The data also suggest that external facilitators are more likely to use or integrate other implementation interventions while fulfilling this problem-solving and supportive role. Preliminary Conclusions This assessment provides evidence that facilitation can be considered a separate implementation intervention, just as supervision and feedback, educational access or similar modalities can be considered separate interventions. Therefore, facilitation should be well defined and clearly evaluated for its perceived usefulness in multiple intervention implementation projects. In addition, researchers should better define the specific contribution of facilitation to the success of practice, with evidence and innovations in different types of projects, different types of sites, and varying levels of strength and complexity.",0,0,
1602,Royal College of Australian and New Zealand Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders,"BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists is coordinating the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry funded by the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Funding Authority. This article presents CPGs for schizophrenia and related disorders. In the last decade, schizophrenia has become more treatable than ever before. Next-generation drug therapies, the renaissance of psychological and psychosocial interventions, and first-generation reform within the specialist mental health system have combined to create a climate of realistic evidence-based optimism. Progressive neuroscientific advances raise the strong possibility of more definitive biologic treatments in the near future. However, this improved potential for better outcomes and quality of life for people with schizophrenia has not been realized in Australia. The efficacy-efficacy gap is wider for schizophrenia than for any other serious medical disorder. Therapeutic nihilism, inadequate provision of services and the stalling of the service reform process, low morale in specialist mental health services, lack of broad-based recovery and life support programs, and a persistent climate of stigma and consequent lack of concern for people with schizophrenia contribute to the failure to effectively treat this failure. are the reasons. These guidelines therefore address only one element in the effort to reduce the impact of schizophrenia. They distill the existing evidence base and make recommendations based on the best available information. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review (1990-2003), including all Cochrane reviews of schizophrenia and all relevant meta-analyses, was conducted and a number of current international clinical practice guidelines were consulted. A number of drafts were revised by the expert committee and developed through a binational consultation process. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of schizophrenia according to the type of treatment and stage of the disease. The key features of the guidelines are: (i) Early detection and comprehensive treatment of first-episode cases is a priority, as the psychosocial and possibly biological effects of the disease can be minimized and outcomes improved. The optimistic attitude of health professionals is an important component from the onset of the disease and in all its stages. (ii) Since the course of the disease is strongly influenced by what occurs during this 'critical period', comprehensive and continuous intervention should be provided during the first 3-5 years after diagnosis. Patients should not have to 'prove chronicity' before gaining consistent access and tenure to specialist mental health services. (iii) Antipsychotic drugs are the cornerstone of treatment. These drugs have improved in quality and tolerability, but should be used more cautiously and in a targeted manner than in the past. The treatment of choice for most patients is now new antipsychotic drugs because of their superior tolerability and particularly low risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is especially true for the first-episode patient, where new agents are the first, second, and third-line choice because of superior tolerability. However, these new agents are associated with potentially serious medium- to long-term adverse events that require careful monitoring of patients. Low-dose conventional antipsychotic drugs may still have a role in a small proportion of patients with complete remission and good tolerability"";"" but the indicators are getting smaller and smaller. These principles are now accepted in most developed countries. (vi) Clozapine should be used early in the course when resistance to treatment with at least two antipsychotic drugs has been demonstrated. This usually means incomplete remission of positive symptomatology, but clozapine may also be considered in situations where there are widespread negative symptoms or where there is a significant or persistent risk of suicide. (v) Comprehensive psychosocial interventions should be routinely available to all patients and their families and should be allocated time to the task by appropriately trained mental health professionals. This includes family interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, occupational rehabilitation, and other forms of therapy, particularly for comorbid conditions such as substance abuse, depression and anxiety. (vi) The social and cultural environment of patients with schizophrenia is a necessary arena for intervention. Adequate housing, financial security, access to meaningful social roles, and the availability of social support are essential components of recovery and quality of life. (vii) Interventions should be carefully tailored to the stage and stage of the disease, gender and cultural background. (viii) The genuine involvement of consumers and relatives in the service development and supply process should be standard. (ix) Maintaining good physical health and the prevention and early treatment of serious medical illnesses have been severely neglected in the management of schizophrenia, resulting in premature death and widespread morbidity. The quality of medical care for patients with schizophrenia should be equivalent to the general population standard. (x) General practitioners (general practitioners) should always be closely involved in the care of patients with schizophrenia. However, this should truly be shared care, and the sole care of a GP with minimal or no specialist involvement, while very common, is not considered an acceptable standard of care. Optimal treatment of schizophrenia requires a multidisciplinary team approach with a centrally involved consultant psychiatrist.",0,0,

Having a stroke increases the risk of having another stroke. There are a number of additional known risk factors that can be modified by diet. This study aimed to systematically review essential nutrients and diets and their role in secondary prevention, as well as to provide evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice. The study was conducted as part of the development process of the Royal College of Physicians' (RCP) National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke (NCG) 4th edition. METHODS: The questions were created by the research team in consultation with the Virtual Stroke Group, an online professional interest group, and the RCP Intercollegiate Stroke Working Group Guideline Development Group. Nine questions covering a variety of individual foods and dietary combinations were identified and searches were performed using five electronic databases (Embase, Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) up to 31 October 2011. The quality and risk of bias of all included studies were assessed using the van Tulder criteria for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) criteria for systematic reviews. RESULTS: 4287 abstracts were identified, 79 articles were reviewed, and 29 systematic reviews and RCTs were included to provide evidence for the secondary prevention components of the guidelines. Evidence statements, recommendations and practical considerations were developed for each question. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review process resulted in the development of evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice and identified areas for further research.",0,0,

BACKGROUND: Previous attempts to investigate the effects of fatigue on surgical performance have suffered from methodological limitations, including inconsistent definitions and the lack of objective measures of fatigue and non-standard measures of surgical performance. Recent research has shown that fatigue can affect the characteristics of saccadic (rapid ballistic) eye movements in non-surgical scenarios. Here, we asked whether fatigue caused by time on duty (~24 hours) could affect saccadic measures in surgical residents. Because saccadic velocity is not under voluntary control, a saccadic velocity-based fatigue index has the potential to provide an accurate and unbiased measure of a patient's fatigue level. METHODS: Joseph Hospital and Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ) using a head-mounted video eye tracker (similar configuration to a surgical eye tracker) eye movements. far), during the performance of 3 tasks: 2 simulated laparoscopic surgical tasks (peg transfer and precision cutting) and a guided saccade task before and after the call day. Residents rated their perceived level of fatigue every 3 hours during their 24-hour shift using a standardized scale. CONCLUSIONS: Time on duty decreased saccadic speed and increased subjective fatigue, but did not affect laparoscopic performance. These results support the hypothesis that saccadic indices reflect gradual changes in fatigue. They also emphasize the complex relationship between continuity of care, patient safety, and fatigued caregivers, noting that fatigue from prolonged tenure does not necessarily result in medical error. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time that saccadic speed is a reliable indicator of subjective fatigue of healthcare professionals during prolonged employment. These findings have potential implications for the development of neuroergonomic tools for detecting fatigue among healthcare professionals and for the specification of future guidelines regarding assistant hours of duty.",0,0,
1606,Security risks associated with the integration of hospital health information technologies and lack of interfacing: a qualitative study of hospital electronic prescribing systems in the UK.,"Background Significant amounts of money are invested in health information technology around the world. However, realizing the benefits and reducing safety risks depends heavily on interfacing to allow efficient integration of information within systems and/or information exchange between systems. As part of the English research programme, we explored the social and technical challenges of integration and interface faced by hospitals in early adopters of independent and hospital-wide multi-module integrated electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) systems. Methods We collected longitudinal qualitative data from six hospitals that we conceptualized as case studies. We conducted 173 interviews (up to three different times), 24 system usage observations and strategic meetings, 17 documents on implementation plans, and 2 full-day expert roundtable discussions with users, implementers, and software vendors. Data were analyzed thematically, first within and then between cases, utilizing perspectives surrounding knowledge infrastructures. Conclusions We observed that integration and interface issues hinder effective information transfer in both stand-alone and multi-module systems, resulting in threats to patient safety resulting from lack of timely information and duplicate data entry. On some standalone systems where users had to deal with multiple logins, interface problems arose immediately and did not subside over time. To eliminate such problems at first glance, multimodular systems appeared. However, in these systems, there was a perceived lack of data consistency between modules, resulting in difficulties in providing a comprehensive overview of the patient record, possibly due to the piecemeal implementation of modules with different functions. While it is possible to access data from some primary care systems, we found that the two-way data transfer between hospitals and primary care services was inadequate and required workarounds, giving opportunity for new errors associated with repetitive and manual transfer of information. While some advanced multimodular systems have begun to implement this functionality, it was still a request at most sites to expand e-prescribing to include modules with other clinically important information needed to support care. However, very modular systems proved difficult to interface with external systems. Conclusions The decision to purchase stand-alone systems and then interface with them, or to pursue a hospital-wide multi-modular system purchase strategy, is a crucial decision in realizing the vision of achieving a fully integrated digital record for hospitals and should be based on the clear relative trade-offs between these choices. somehow appreciated. Multi-module systems offered slightly better usability, while stand-alone systems provided greater flexibility and innovation opportunities, particularly regarding interoperability with external systems and customizability to the needs of different user groups.",0,0,
1607,"The salivary cortisol response after a medical interview: effect of doctor communication behavior, depressive affect and alexithymia.","OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether and possibly how a medical consultation affects adrenocortical activity in patients with musculoskeletal pain with and without alexithymia. METHODS: Female patients (N = 54) recruited from a patient organization for fibromyalgia completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), and subgroups with low and high scores, respectively, were selected for inclusion. Seven doctors conducted consultations trying to change their communication according to the given guidelines. All consultations were videotaped and analyzed by the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) to assess the actual content of the consultations. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in depressive affect from pre-interview to post-interview was associated with relatively high cortisol levels 24 hours after consultation, but only in alexithymia patients. Psychosocial questions from the doctor were associated with increased depressive affect immediately after the interview, but not with cortisol responses at any time. CONCLUSION: In patients with deficient affect regulation, the increase in depressive affect after a medical interview may possibly be related to delayed effects on adrenocortical activity mediated by rumination. PRACTICE PRACTICES: Providers should be sensitive to possible affect regulation deficits in their patients.",0,0,
1608,"Salt, hypertension and cardiovascular risk","For more than a century, salt and blood pressure have been linked. Prospective randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence that reducing salt intake by 100 mmol daily can reduce systolic blood pressure by 3-5 mm Hg, while diastolic blood pressure can be reduced by 1 mm Hg. The effect of salt restriction is highly dependent on individual salt sensitivity. Whether reducing salt intake will ultimately result in a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality will be determined in future studies.",0,0,
1609,Scanning for pleasure or digging for horror? Comparison of findings from a postal survey with findings from a focus group study,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing support for mixed-method approaches, we still have little systematic information on the results of combining surveys and focus groups. While the methodological aspects of survey questionnaires have been extensively researched, the features of focus group methodology have not been adequately studied. We suggest and discuss whether the focus group setting encourages participants to negatively exaggerate views compared to survey questionnaires. DISCUSSION: Based on a sample from our own research, in which we conducted a survey as a follow-up to a focus group study, and with reference to theoretical approaches and empirical evidence from the literature on survey respondents' behavior and small-group dynamics, the possibility that a discrepancy in findings between focus groups and survey reflects characteristics of two different research methods . Contrary to the survey, the focus group study showed that physicians generally viewed clinical guidelines negatively. We were not convinced that this difference in results was due to methodological flaws in any of the studies and instead we discussed how this difference could be the result of a general methodological phenomenon. SUMMARY: Based on studies of how survey questionnaires affect responses, it seems reasonable to argue that surveys are more likely to find exaggerated positive opinions. Conversely, there are some indications in the literature that focus groups can lead to complaints and overly negative attitudes, but this is still an open question. We suggest that these topics can be exaggerated in focus groups, although problematic issues tend to be under-reported in survey questionnaires. For example, we discuss the importance of increasing our understanding of focus group methodology by reporting interesting inconsistencies in mixed methods research. Additionally, more empirical research should be conducted on focus groups to improve the methodology and test our hypothesis.",0,0,
1610,School-Based Mental Health Intervention for Children Affected by Political Violence in Indonesia,"Context Little is known about the effectiveness of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflict in low- and middle-income settings. Childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based intervention designed for children exposed to conflict, delivered in a low-income setting. Design, Environment, and Participants A cluster randomized study involving 495 children (81.4% inclusion rate) with a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.3) attending randomly selected schools in communities affected by political violence in Poso, Indonesia. and were screened for symptoms of exposure (=1 event), post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety compared to a waiting-listed control group. Unblinded assessment was performed before, 1 week, and 6 months after treatment between March and December 2006. Intervention Over 5 weeks, fifteen sessions of a manual, school-based group intervention that included trauma processing activities, collaborative play, and creativity - expressive elements administered by locally trained associate professionals. We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Main Outcome Measures Child Post-Traumatic Stress Scale, Depression Self-Assessment Scale, Self-Report for Anxiety-Related Disorders 5-item version, and Children's Hope Scale, and assessed dysfunction as treatment outcomes using standard symptom checklists. and locally developed rating scales. Results When adjusting for clustering of participants in schools, PTSD symptoms (mean change difference, 2.78""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and sustained hope (mean change difference, -2.21; 95% CI, - Changes in traumatic statements (stress-related physical symptoms) (mean change difference, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.12 to 1.11) in the treatment group compared to the waiting list group, depressive symptoms (mean change difference, 0.70; 95% CI, -0.08 to 1.49), anxiety (mean change difference, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.56), and functionality (mean change difference, 0.52; ""95% CI, -0.43 to 1.46) was not different between treatment and waiting list groups. Conclusions In this study of children in violence-affected communities, a school-based intervention reduced symptoms of post-traumatic stress and helped maintain hope, but did not reduce traumatic stress-related symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or functional impairment.",0,0,
1611,"Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomized trial.","OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a common cause of non-communicable diseases. Guidelines recommend that physicians screen and provide brief recommendations to motivate weight loss by referring to behavioral weight loss programs. But doctors rarely intervene, and no trials have been made on the subject. We conducted this trial to determine whether brief physician intervention is acceptable and effective for reducing body weight in obese patients. METHODS: In this parallel, two-arm, randomized study, patients presenting to 137 primary care physicians in England were screened for obesity. Individuals can be registered if they are at least 18 years old, have a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2 (or at least 25 kg/m2 if of Asian ethnicity) and have a high body fat percentage. At the end of the consultation, the physician randomly assigned the participants (1:1) to one of the two 30 s interventions. Randomization was done via pre-made randomization cards placed in opaque sealed envelopes and labeled with a code representing the assignment, given to physicians to open at the time of treatment assignment. In active intervention, the doctor offered a referral to a weight management group (12 sessions of 1 hour once a week) and, if the referral was accepted, the doctor made the patient make an appointment and offered follow-up. In the control intervention, the physician advised the patient that losing weight would benefit his health. The primary outcome was weight change at 12 months in the intent-to-treat population evaluated blinded to treatment allocation. We also assessed the feelings of patients who were asked about discussing their weight when they visited their GP for other reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not anticipate any adverse events in the usual sense, so the safety implications were not evaluated. This trial is registered in the ISRCTN Registry with number ISRCTN26563137. RESULTS: We screened 8,403 patients, 2728 (32%) of whom were obese, between June 4, 2013 and December 23, 2014. Of these obese patients, 2256 (83%) agreed to participate, and 1882 were eligible, enrolled, and included in the intent-to-treat analysis, with 940 in the support group and 942 in the advice group. 722 (77%) people assigned to the support intervention agreed to participate in the weight management group, and 379 (40%) of these people did, versus 82 (9%) who were assigned a referral intervention. In the entire study population, the mean weight change at 12 months was 2.43 kg with the support intervention and 1.04 kg with the advice intervention, with an adjusted difference of 1.43 kg (95% CI 0.89-1.97). Patients' responses to GPs' brief interventions were appropriate (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.07, p=0.21) or helpfulness (1.05, 0.89-1.26, p=0.54)"";"" overall, four (<1%) patients considered their intervention inappropriate and unhelpful, while 1530 (81%) patients considered it appropriate and beneficial.

1612,"Screening and Intervention for Comorbid Substance Disorders, PTSD, Depression, and Suicide: A Trauma Center Questionnaire","OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined screening and intervention procedures for comorbid substance use and mental disorders in trauma centers in the United States, but these disorders are endemic among traumatic injury survivors. In 2006, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) mandated that level I and level II trauma centers screen for alcohol use problems and that these level I centers provide brief intervention for those who screen positive. The ACS is expected to recommend best practice policy guidelines for screening for drug use problems and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined screening and intervention procedures for the full spectrum of comorbid mental and substance use disorders in US trauma centers. METHODS: Participants at all level I and level II trauma centers (N=518) in the United States were asked to complete a questionnaire describing screening and intervention procedures for alcohol and drug use problems, suicidality, depression, and PTSD. RESULTS: There were 391 (75%) participants. More than 80% of trauma centers are routinely screened for alcohol and drug use problems. Routine screening and intervention for suicide, depression, and PTSD were significantly less common"";"" in fact, only 7% of centers reported routine screening for PTSD. Consistent with ACS policy, level I centers were significantly more likely to provide alcohol intervention than level II centers. RESULTS: Alcohol screening and intervention occurred frequently in US trauma centers and appeared to respond to ACS instructions. In the future, efforts to improve clinical research and policy may improve screening and intervention procedures for the highly prevalent comorbid mental disorders.",0,0,
1613,Screening and interventions for overweight in children and adolescents: statement of recommendation,"The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of non-federal experts in prevention and primary care that systematically reviews evidence of efficacy and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. This recommendation addresses the evidence for the accuracy of screening children and adolescents using BMI, the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacological interventions in improving health outcomes in these children, and the potential harms of routine screening and intervention. Using the USPSTF methodology, an analytical framework with key questions was developed to guide the systematic review that underpins this recommendation. The number of overweight children and adolescents has more than doubled in the past 25 years. Excess weight during childhood and adolescence is associated with increased health risks. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral counseling or other preventive interventions with overweight children and adolescents that could be applied in primary care settings. Currently available studies are limited by factors such as small sample sizes, poor generalizability, and variable follow-up. Based on this critical gap in the evidence for efficacy, the USPSTF concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening for overweight in children and adolescents as a means of preventing adverse health outcomes (the ""I"" recommendation). There are several gaps in research evidence regarding screening and interventions for overweight children and adolescents in the primary care setting. Research is needed to provide well-defined and effective approaches to medical and psychological screening in children, as well as effective clinical approaches that can be implemented by primary care clinicians for the prevention and treatment of childhood overweight.",0,0,
1614,Screening and Treatment of Suicide Risk Related to Primary Care: A Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"Background: In 2009, suicide was responsible for 36897 deaths in the United States. Objective: To review the accuracy of screening tools and the efficacy and safety of screening and treatment of suicide risk in primary care populations and settings. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL (2002 - 17 July 2012) excerpts from MEDLINE's surveillance survey (July-December 2012) for gray literature and additional screening trials (July-December 2012). Study Selection: Primary care Fair or good quality English studies evaluating the accuracy of screening tools in or similar populations and trials of suicide prevention interventions in primary care or mental health care settings Data Extraction: One investigator summarized data and another controlled data abstraction. Two researchers rated study quality. Data Synthesis : Insufficient evidence to determine benefits of screening in primary care populations; very limited evidence found no serious harm it took. Minimal evidence, limited to high-risk populations, showed poor performance of screening tools in adolescents. Trial evidence showed that psychotherapy reduced suicide attempts in high-risk adults, but not in adolescents. Most trials were not powerful enough to detect effects on deaths. Limitation: Treatment evidence is from high-risk groups rather than screening-detected populations. Evidence for adolescents, older adults, and racial or ethnic minorities was limited. Conclusion: Primary care. Applicable screening tools may help identify some adults who are at high risk of suicide but have limited ability to detect suicide risk in adolescents. Psychotherapy may reduce suicide attempts in some high-risk adults, but effective interventions for high-risk adolescents have yet to be proven.

Results – Compliance with this screening procedure tends to be low. A self-administered enema two hours before a sigmoidoscopy can provide satisfactory bowel preparation.",0,1,
1616,Colorectal cancer screening in the foreground,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate primary care clinicians' knowledge, beliefs and practices regarding colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: We surveyed 77 primary care providers at six clinics in central Massachusetts to assess various factors associated with colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Most agreed with the guidelines for stool occult blood testing (97%) and sigmoidoscopy (87%) reported as usual practice. Although the majority (86%) recommend colonoscopy as a colorectal cancer screening test, it has rarely been reported as routine practice. In addition, 36% considered barium enema as a colorectal cancer screening option and was rarely reported as usual practice. Digital rectal exams and in-office stool occult blood testing have been widely reported as usual practice, although there is no evidence to support efficacy. However, these were often reported with a guideline-approved testing option. Although only 10% reported frequent refusal of stool occult blood test/home, 60% reported that sigmoidoscopy was performed. Frequently cited patient barriers to sigmoidoscopy compliance included fear that the procedure would cause harm, and patients' assuming that symptoms would occur if there was a problem. Health systems' perception of barriers to sigmoidoscopy was less strong. RESULTS: Most providers recommended guideline-approved colorectal cancer screening. However, patient rejection for sigmoidoscopy was common. The results suggest that multiple levels of intervention, including patient and provider education and systems strategies, can help increase prevalence.",0,0,
1617,Dementia Screening in Primary Care: Summary of Evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a large and growing problem but is often not diagnosed in its early stages. Screening and early treatment can reduce the pain burden of this syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for the early treatment of dementia. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, experts and bibliographies Number of reviews. STUDY SELECTION: The authors developed eight key questions representing the logical chain between screening and improved health outcomes, with eligibility criteria for acceptable evidence for each question. Acceptable evidence was obtained by searching the data sources. DATA DRAWING: Two reviewers summarized relevant information using standardized abstraction forms and graded article quality according to US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: No randomized, controlled screening studies for dementia have been completed. . Short screening tools can detect some people with early dementia (positive predictive value < or = 50%). Six to 12 months of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors moderately slows the decline of cognitive and general clinical change scores in some patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Function is minimally affected and less than 20% of patients stop taking cholinesterase inhibitors because of side effects. Only limited evidence suggests that any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention slows decline in people with early dementia. Although intensive multi-component caregiver interventions may delay hospice placement of caregiver patients, the significance of this finding for those who do not yet have caregivers is unclear. Other potential benefits and harms of screening have not been explored. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tests can detect undiagnosed dementia. In people with mild to moderate clinically detected Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors are somewhat effective at slowing cognitive decline. The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors or other treatments on people with dementia detected by screening is unclear.",0,0,
1618,Screening for Depression in Adult Patients in Primary Care Settings: A Systematic Evidence Review,"Background: In primary care settings, prevalence estimates of major depressive disorder range from 5% to 13% in all adults, with lower estimates (6% to 9%) in those older than 55 years. In 2002, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening adults for depression in clinical practice with systems that ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. Objective: To provide a targeted, updated systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of screening adult patients for depression in primary care, the benefits of depression treatment in older adults, and the harms of depression treatment in older adults. antidepressant drugs. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Impact Studies, PsycINFO (1998 to 2007), expert recommendations, and bibliographies of recent systematic reviews. Study Selection: Moderate to good quality randomized clinical trials or controlled clinical trials""; systematic reviews; meta-analyses;"" and large observational studies of serious adverse events and premature discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events. All studies are published in English. Data Extraction: Two researchers summarized, critically evaluated, and synthesized 33 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data Synthesis: Nine studies of fair or good quality indicate that staff-supported primary care depression screening and care management programs, such as case management or the involvement of mental health professionals, can improve depression response and remission. There was no benefit in screening programs without staff assistance in depression care. Seven regulatory reviews or meta-analyses and 3 large cohort studies show no increased risk for suicide deaths completed with antidepressant therapy. There was an increased risk of suicidal behavior in young adults (18-29 years) who took the antidepressant, particularly paroxetine, but decreased in older adults. Limitation: The study of harms was limited to serious adverse events and primarily available systematic reviews were used. Additional studies published from 2007 to 2008 expand this review. Conclusion: Depression screening programs are unlikely to improve depression outcomes without significant staff-supported depression care support. Close monitoring of all adult patients starting antidepressant therapy, particularly those under 30 years of age, is important to ensure both safety and optimal therapy.",0,0,
1619,Hypertension Screening,"Objective: To review the evidence on four questions for screening asymptomatic adults for arterial hypertension: Is hypertension a major health concern? Can it be detected at an early, presymptomatic stage? Is treatment available and effective? Do the benefits of screening outweigh the costs and risks? Data Description and Selection: We conducted a computational search on the MEDLARS database to identify population-based drug therapy trials for mild hypertension"";"" Other relevant citations are included where appropriate. Data Synthesis: We approached the first questions in our analysis with narrative analysis and argument. Estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness of screening was addressed by formal mathematical modeling of the impact of screening on various US populations. Analysis Results: Hypertension is clearly an important health problem. It can be diagnosed early and has effective treatment. Screening asymptomatic adults for hypertension is more advantageous compared to the associated risks and costs. In our estimations, screening is most cost-effective for older adults and men compared to women, and is highly sensitive to the cost of treating mild hypertension. Conclusions: We recommend screening for hypertension for all adults. We also discuss the frequency and pattern of browsing activities. When a low-cost therapy is used, the cost-effectiveness of hypertension screening compares favorably with other cardiovascular interventions.",0,0,

DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis with a decision model of alternative screening methods for depression, including standardized postpartum depression and general depression tools. The performance of scanning tools was derived from a systematic review and bivariate meta-analysis at a range of tool cutoffs"";"" Estimates of other relevant parameters are derived from literature sources and relevant databases. A decision tree considered the full course of treatment from possible onset of postpartum depression through identification, treatment, and possible relapse. SETUP Primary care. PARTICIPANTS A hypothetical population of women evaluated for postpartum depression either through routine care alone or supplemented using formal identification methods six weeks after birth, as recommended in recent guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs expressed in 2006-7 prices and impact on health outcomes expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The time horizon of the analysis was one year. CONCLUSIONS Routine administration of postpartum or general depression questionnaires did not appear to be cost-effective compared to routine care alone. The Edinburgh scale of postpartum depression (at 16 cut-off points) had an increased cost-effectiveness rate (ICER) of 41,103 pounds (45,398 euros, $67,130) per QALY compared with routine care alone. For all other strategies, ICER ranged from £49,928 to £272,463 per QALY compared to routine care alone, while the probability that no formal identification strategy would be cost-effective was 88% (59%) at the £20,000 (£30,000) cost-effectiveness threshold. per QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of managing misidentified depression (false positive result) was a major driver of the model, while formal identification approaches did not appear to be cost-effective in any appropriate estimate of this cost. CONCLUSIONS Official methods of definition for postpartum depression do not appear to represent value for money for the NHS. The main determinant of cost effectiveness appears to be the potential additional costs of managing women who are incorrectly diagnosed as depressed. Official identification methods for postpartum depression do not currently meet the National Screening Committee's criteria for adopting a screening strategy as part of national health policy.",0,0,
1621,Screening for speech and language delay in preschool children: systematic evidence review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"BACKGROUND: PEDIATRIC (ISSN Numbers: Edition, 0031-4005"";"" Online, 1098-4275). Published in the public domain by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Speech and language development is a useful indicator of a child's overall development and cognitive ability and is associated with school success. Identifying children at risk for developmental delay or related problems can lead to intervention services and family assistance at a young age where the chances of recovery are best. However, optimal methods for speech and language delay screening have not been determined, and screening has been inconsistently applied in primary care. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the strengths and limitations of the evidence for the effectiveness of screening and interventions for speech and language delay in preschool children to determine the balance between the benefits and adverse effects of routine primary care screening for the development of guidelines. US Preventive Services Task Force. The target population includes all children up to 5 years of age without known pre-existing conditions associated with speech and language delay, such as hearing and neurological disorders. METHODS: Studies were selected from the Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (1966 - 19 November 2004), systematic reviews, reference lists, and experts. The evidence review included only articles published in English and accessible through libraries. Only randomized, controlled studies were considered to examine the efficacy of interventions. As long as the initial assessment occurred at any time or age after screening and/or intervention, as long as the child had 1 population =2 screening techniques, outcome measures were considered and comparisons of a single screening technique across different populations were made. missing. Fourteen randomized, controlled intervention trials of good and fair quality reported significantly improved speech and language outcomes compared with control groups. Improvement in several areas, including articulation, phonology, expressive language, receptive language, lexical acquisition, and syntax, was demonstrated among children of all age groups studied and in multiple therapeutic settings. Improvements in other functional outcomes, such as socialization skills, self-esteem, and enhanced play themes, were demonstrated in some, but not all, of the 4 studies that measured them. Overall, intervention studies were small and heterogeneous, may be subject to plateau effects, and reported short-term outcomes based on a variety of tools and measures. As a result, long-term outcomes are unknown, interventions cannot be directly compared, and their generalizability is questionable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of risk factors to guide selective screening is not supported by studies. Various aspects of screening have been poorly studied to determine optimal methods, including which instrument to use, what age to scan, and what interval is most useful. Intervention trials show improvement in some outcome measures, but results and generalizability are limited. Data are lacking to address other important issues, including the effectiveness of screening in primary care settings, the role of surveillance developed by primary care physicians prior to referral for diagnostic evaluation, the speech and nonlinguistic and long-term benefits of interventions, and the adverse effects of screening. and interventions.",0,0,
1622,Screening Surgeons for HIV Infection: Cost Effectiveness Analysis,"AIM. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a policy to screen surgeons for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to prevent HIV transmission to patients with invasive procedures. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: A one-time national screening program will identify approximately 137 surgeons (range, 28 to 423 surgeons) with HIV infection and approximately 4.3 infections (range, 1.9 to 21.3 infections) and 0.9 infections in patients treated by infected surgeons. (range, 0 to 12.9 infections) with a direct cost of $8.1 million and an induced cost of about $44 million in sexual partners of infected surgeons. This results in an annual expenditure of $458,000 per life saved (range of $147,000 to $687,000 per life saved), while an annual screening program will result in expenditure of approximately $1.1 million per life saved (range, $338,000 to $1,886,000 per person). . years of life saved). If the prevalence of HIV infection in surgeons is estimated at three times our baseline estimate (an increase from 0.1% to 0.3%), annual screening would result in expenditures of approximately $741,000 per life saved. If the probability of seroconversion after a patient's exposure to a contaminated device is increased from our baseline estimate of 0.29% to 5.0%, an annual screening program would still cost more than $228,000 per life saved. CONCLUSION: To prevent HIV transmission to patients undergoing invasive procedures, surgeons' HIV screening requires expenditures per year of life saved, significantly higher than most accepted healthcare interventions. Surveillance studies of patients treated by HIV-infected surgeons should be continued to confirm that transmission of HIV to patients undergoing invasive procedures is rare.",0,1,
1623,"Screening, isolation and decolonization strategies for the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in intensive care units: cost-effectiveness evaluation","OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening, isolation and decolonization strategies in the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units. DESIGN Economic evaluation based on a dynamic transmission model. SET England and Wales. Population The patient population in the theoretical intensive care unit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Infections, deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), increased cost-effectiveness rates and net monetary benefits for alternative strategies. RESULTS All decolonization strategies have improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Although universal decolonization (regardless of MRSA status) is the most cost-effective method in the short term, strategies using screening may be preferable to target MRSA carriers because of the reduced risk of selecting resistance. Among such targeted strategies, universal acceptance and weekly screening with polymerase chain reaction combined with decolonization using nasal mupirocin was the most cost-effective. This finding was robust in terms of the size of intensive care units, the prevalence of MRSA at admission, the proportion of patients classified as high-risk, and the absolute value of willingness to pay for health benefits. All strategies that used isolation but not decolonization improved health outcomes, but increased costs. When the prevalence of MRSA on admission to the ICU is 5% and the willingness to pay per QALY gained is between approximately £20,000 (â€šâ€23,000"";""$32,000) to £30,000, such the best strategy is to isolate only patients at high risk of carrying MRSA. (after prior or admission identification and weekly screening for MRSA using chromogenic agar). Weekly screening using polymerase chain reaction-based MRSA detection with general admission and isolation was unlikely to be cost-effective unless the prevalence was high (10% of patients colonized with MRSA at presentation). CONCLUSIONS MRSA control strategies using decolonization are likely to provide cost savings in the ICU setting provided that resistance is absent, and if untargeted decolonization is considered unacceptable, combining universal screening with decolonization using polymerase chain reaction is likely to represent good value for money. There is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for MRSA in non-decolonization intensive care units, except in high-prevalence settings.",0,0,
1624,Secondary prevention after minor stroke and TIA - usual care and development of a support program,"BACKGROUND: Effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA exist, but adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is generally weak. The study aimed to determine the quality of secondary prevention in usual care and to develop a step-by-step modeled support program. METHODS: Two consecutive groups of patients with acute minor stroke or TIA on usual outpatient treatment were compared with a secondary prevention program. Risk factor control and drug compliance were evaluated at 6-month follow-up (6A-FU). Usual care consisted of detailed information on vascular risk factor targets given by primary care physicians at discharge and regular outpatient care. Four additional outpatient appointments were used in the incremental modeled support program. A combination of educational and behavioral strategies was used. RESULTS: In the observational cohort who indicated that they were open to participate in a prevention program, 168 patients (mean age 64.7 years, blood pressure at admission (BP): 155/84 mmHg) and 173 patients (mean age 67.6 years, BP: 161/84) participated in a support program mmHg) was evaluated at 6 months. According to the guidelines, the proportion of patients with BP was 50% in the usual care and 77% in the support program (p<0.01). LDL<100 mg/dl was measured at 71% vs. 62% (p = 0.12). The proportion of patients who quit smoking was 79% versus 50% (p<0.01). 89% versus 72% of patients with atrial fibrillation were using oral anticoagulation (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factor control is inadequate in usual care. Secondary prevention targets were met more frequently in the supported cohort. Effects on (cerebro-)vascular recurrence rates will be evaluated in a multicenter randomized trial.",0,0,
1625,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and routine specialist care in adolescents with major depression with and without cognitive behavioral therapy: randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether the combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with clinical care is more effective in the short term than an SSRI alone and clinical care in adolescents with moderate to severe major depression. DESIGN Pragmatic randomized controlled superiority trial. SETTING 6 outpatient clinics in Manchester and Cambridge. PARTICIPANTS 208 adolescents 11-17 years of age with moderate to severe major or probable major depression who did not respond to a brief first intervention. Adolescents with suicidal tendencies, depressive psychosis, or behavioral disorders were included. INTERVENTIONS 103 adolescents received SSRIs and routine care"";"" 105 received an SSRI, routine care, and CBT. The trial lasted for 12 weeks, followed by a 16-week maintenance phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change in score (primary outcome) on National Health outcome scales for children and adolescents from baseline with 12 weeks as primary and 28 weeks as follow-up endpoint. Secondary measures were change in scores on the mood and emotions questionnaire, the revised children's depression rating scale, the children's overall rating scale, and the clinical global impression improvement scale. RESULTS Treatment effect for primary outcome at 12 weeks was -0.64 (95% confidence interval -2.54 to 1.26, P=0.50). In a longitudinal analysis, there were no differences in treatment efficacy for either the primary (mean treatment effect 0.001, -1.52 to 1.52, P=0.99) or secondary outcome measures. On average, there was a reduction in suicidal thoughts and self-harm. There was no evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy had a protective effect on suicidal ideation or action. By 28 weeks, 57% had improved a lot or very much and 20% had not. CONCLUSIONS For adolescents with moderate to severe major depression, there is no evidence that the combination of CBT plus an SSRI in the presence of routine clinical care contributes to a better outcome for 28 weeks compared to providing routine clinical care and an SSRI alone.

Our secondary goal is to explore whether the effects of self-formulated contingent plans are altered by (i) the form of the plan (eg, does the individual participate in its development as planned?) and (iii) the complexity of the intended behavior (eg, number of actions required; ""regularity of behavior)"". .",0,1,
1628,Self-help books for depression: How can practitioners and patients make the right choice?,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and important public health problem that is often treated by general practitioners. The self-help approach is popular with patients, but little is known about its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to review and update the evidence for the clinical efficacy of bibliotherapy in the treatment of depression. Our secondary aim was to determine which of these self-help materials are generally available for purchase and to examine the evidence specific to these publications. METHOD: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CCTR, PsiTri, and the National Research Registry were searched for randomized trials that evaluated self-help books for depression and included participants aged 16+ with a diagnosis or symptoms of depression. Clinical symptoms, quality of life, costs, or acceptability for users were required outcome measures. Papers were obtained and data extracted independently by two researchers. A meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed using the mean score and standard deviation of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the endpoint of the trial. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified. None met CONSORT guidelines and all were small, with the largest trial having 40 patients per group. Nine of these reviewed two recent publications, Anxiety and Depression Management (UK) and Feeling Good (US). A meta-analysis of 6 studies evaluating Feeling Good found a large treatment effect compared to delayed treatment (standardized mean difference = -1.36""; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.76 to -0.96). In addition to the two books evaluated in the trials, five self-help books were determined to be available and widely purchased by the public. CONCLUSION: There are many self-help books available for the treatment of depression. For the majority, there is little direct evidence for their effectiveness. There is weak evidence to suggest that bibliotherapy based on the cognitive behavioral therapy approach is helpful for some people when given some additional guidance. More studies are needed in primary care to explore the cost-effectiveness of self-help and the optimal format and presentation of materials.",0,0,
1629,Self-management programs for COPD: moving forward,"Self-management is becoming increasingly important in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is confusion about what processes are involved, how the value of self-management should be determined, and research priorities. To gain more insight and agreement on the content, outcomes and future aspects of COPD self-management of the programmes, a group of interested researchers and physicians, all of whom have previously published on the topic and collaborated on other projects, organized a workshop. This article summarizes their initial findings. Self-management programs aim at structural behavior change to maintain treatment effects after the programs are complete. Programs should include techniques for behavior change, be personalized, take the patient's point of view into account, and vary according to the course of the patient's disease and co-morbidities. Evaluation should include process variables. This report is a step towards greater alignment in the field of self-management. To increase clarity on effectiveness, future studies should clearly define interventions, be appropriately designed and strengthened, and include results that focus more on the acquisition and application of new skills. In this way, more evidence and a better understanding of self-management programs will be obtained and the formulation of more specific guidelines on self-management will be possible.",0,0,
1630,Personal protective equipment use among Chinese intensive care clinicians during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are frequently treated in intensive care units (ICUs), which poses a significant risk of hospital-acquired transmission to critical care clinicians and other patients. Despite the large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers to the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in intensive care units have been identified that lead to inadequate compliance. The use of PPE among critical care clinicians has not been extensively evaluated, particularly during pandemic influenza. This study examined knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviors among ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) during pandemic flu and barriers to compliance with PPE use. METHODOLOGY/KEY FINDINGS: A questionnaire consisting of 36 questions was developed and mailed to all healthcare workers in 21 intensive care units in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 doctors, nurses and other professionals were surveyed and 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of the respondents reported that they had received a pandemic influenza education program before caring for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported that they had sufficient knowledge about protecting themselves and the patient. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of PPE, and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) with the use of PPE during patient care. In multivariate analysis, organizational factors such as 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, positive attitudes towards the use of PPE, availability of PPE in the ICU and patient knowledge of influenza precautions, as well as condemnation by supervisors for non-compliance were associated with high compliance, while negative attitudes towards PPE use and Violation of PPE use were independent predictors of low adherence. CONCLUSION/IMPORTANCE: Knowledge and self-reported agreement on recommended PPE use among Chinese critical care clinicians is insufficient. Perceived barriers must be addressed to bridge the important gap between perception and knowledge or behavior.",0,0,

This study reports self-reported violations during the medication administration process of nurses. Purpose To evaluate the extent of violations in the drug administration process among nurses. Design, setting, and participants Participants were 199 nurses from two US urban, academic, tertiary, independent pediatric hospitals working in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), hematology-oncology-transplant (HOT) unit, or a medical unit. surgical (Med/Surg) unit. In a cross-sectional survey, nurses were asked about routine or emergency violations in three steps of the medication administration process. Main outcome measure Self-reported violations of the three drug administration protocols were made using a seven-point 0-6 scale from ""not at all"" to ""too much."" Results Analysis of variance determined that violation reports were highest for emergencies rather than routine operations, with the highest number of HOT unit nurses, followed by PICU nurses, followed by Med/Surgical unit nurses, and the highest during patient identification followed by matching a drug. documenting an application followed by a drug administration record. There was also a significant three-way interaction between the violation situation, the step in the process, and the unit. Consequences Protocol violations occur throughout the drug administration process and their prevalence varies by hospital unit, step in the process, and violation status.

A randomized controlled trial among resident physicians,"BACKGROUND: Online physician education is on the rise, but its effectiveness compared to current self-study methods is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare the knowledge, learning efficiency, and student satisfaction produced by the self-study of World Wide Web-based and print-based guidelines for care after acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: 12 family medicine and internal medicine specialization programs at four universities. PARTICIPANTS: 162 assistants. INTERVENTIONS: In supervised sessions, participants were randomly assigned to study from printed materials or SAGE (Graphic Evidence Self-Study Acceleration), a Web-based training system. Both methods used the same self-assessment questions and answers and guide texts, but SAGE included hyperlinks to specific guide passages and graphic evidence animations. MEASUREMENTS: Scores on multiple choice knowledge tests, point attainment per unit of study time, and ratings on a student satisfaction scale. RESULTS: Immediate posttest scores on a 20-point scale were similar in the SAGE and control groups (median score 15.0"" compared to 14.5; P>0.2), but SAGE users spent less time studying (median 38.5 minutes compared to 27.0). ; P<0.001) and therefore had higher learning efficiency (median score gain 8.6 compared to 6.7 points per hour; P = 0.04). On a scale of 5 to 20, SAGE users were more satisfied with learning (median score, 17.0 versus 15.0) After 4 to 6 months, information was equally reduced in the SAGE and control groups (median score 12.0 compared to 11.0; P = 0.12).

1634,Sertraline as monotherapy in the treatment of psychotic and non-psychotic depression,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective when used alone in the treatment of unipolar depression with psychotic features. The aim of this study is to examine the response to sertraline treatment in patients with and without psychotic features using standard criteria such as recovery and remission. METHODS: An 8-week open-label trial of sertraline was performed in inpatients with depression. Twenty-five subjects had DSM-IV major depressive disorder with psychotic features and 25 had DSM-IV major depressive disorder without psychotic features. After 1 week of open washout, all subjects were initially rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). HAM-D was administered weekly and BPRS was re-administered only at the end of the 8-week trial. The drug dose was started at 50 mg/day, increased to 100 mg/day after 1 week, and then increased to 200 mg/day if subjects were not in remission. RESULTS: Depressed patients without psychosis, remission (HAM-D score - 7""; p =.001), response (HAM-D score - 50% of baseline score; p = .011), referral to electroconvulsive therapy (HAM-D) score >/= 15;"" p =.011) or change in HAM-D scores (p =.016). Baseline HAM-D score and psychosis independently predicted response, whereas baseline BPRS scores did not, regardless of whether psychotic state was entered in the analyses. CONCLUSION: Psychotic depression responds worse to sertraline alone than depression without psychosis. Psychosis is a predictor of response, independent of the degree of depression and general psychopathology. The limitations resulting from the open-label design and the differences between this study and others using the SSRI for psychotic depression are discussed.",0,0,

Identified gaps were aligned with the four key phases of the care pathway. Qualitative analysis software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: For each phase of the pathway, key principles were identified to guide future development. These key principles relate to the NHS framework and involve family, define clear pathways and increasing children's participation. Participants identified potential strategies for service improvement, such as community-based interventions and information provision. CONCLUSION: Challenges in providing services to children with DCD include confusing service pathways and poor partnership work. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to use collaborative work strategies that promote children's participation. PRACTICES FOR REHABILITATION: There are numerous challenges associated with applying best practice principles in the provision of therapy services for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). It is important that AHPs look for ways to involve parents and education professionals at all stages of the care pathway to ensure optimal service delivery for the child. Addressing participation is an important issue and community-based strategies can be particularly useful as both a preventive action and an intervention approach.",0,0,

1637,"Gender, stroke and inflammation: potential for estrogen-mediated immune protection in stroke.","Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the primary cause of disability in the developed world. Experimental and clinical data suggest that stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease and that men exhibit an enhanced intrinsic susceptibility to ischemic injury for most of their lives. The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well known, but estrogen exposure can also be harmful, especially in older women. The mechanisms for this remain unclear. Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen in relation to neuronal damage, but cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells. Despite estrogen's potent anti-inflammatory effects, few studies have investigated the contribution of estrogen to sex differences in the inflammatory response to stroke. This review examines the potential role of estrogen-mediated immune protection in ischemic injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,

Activity, function and patient experience with physician consultation about sexual activity after AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from a 2:1 sample of 18- to 55-year-old women (N=2349) and men (N=1152) with AMI. The mean age was 48 years. Of those (12% of women, 19% of men) who reported discussing sexual activity with a doctor once a month after AMI, 68% were given restrictions: limiting sex (35%), taking a more passive role (26%), and/ or keep heart rate low (23%). In risk-adjusted analyzes, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk, 1.07""; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.11), age (relative risk, 1.05% at 10 years; 95 confidence interval) , 1.02-1.08) and sexual inactivity at baseline (relative risk, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.15) Among patients who received counseling, women in Spain were significantly more likely than women in the United States. restriction was more likely to be applied (relative risk ;"" 1.36, 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.66).

METHODS: The authors reviewed relevant journal articles, physician licensing exams, and professional body publications to identify learning objectives for human sexuality in undergraduate medical curricula. CONCLUSIONS: There is consensus on many attitudinal goals and some skills that medical students should acquire on sexual health. There is less consensus on sexual knowledge that student physicians should specialize in. Several common knowledge goals focus narrowly on the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction and disease. CONCLUSION: Model sexual health curricula, licensing exams, and guidelines from professional organizations mainly focus on the pathological aspects of sexuality.

Data sources from 1997 to 2006 medical and drug claims 1,410,806 male employees over 40 years of age with private insurance at 44 major companies. Results People who used emergency drugs had higher rates of STDs than nonusers even before they started Emergency drug therapy (288 v. 156 per 100,000 people per year). p. < 0.005). Adjusting for these baseline rates, users of ED drugs had higher rates of STDs in the year after their first ED drug use (OR 2.06, p < 0.05) compared with nonusers during the same period. Among users of ED drugs, STD rates were higher in the year following the first ED drug use than in the previous year (289 vs. 327 per 100,000 population per year, p < 0.05). Limitations Selection bias prevents firm conclusions from being drawn about whether the use of ED treatments directly leads to death. It causes an increase in STDs. Conclusions Compared to those who do not use emergency medicine, the rates of STDs are higher both before starting treatment and after one year. At the very least, this association suggests that men taking emergency medications may benefit from early discussions about safe sexual practices and closer monitoring for STDs. It is also possible that the availability of ED medications may increase STD rates.",0,0,
1641,Collaborative decision-making does not influence physicians against clinical practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: While shared decision-making (SDM) and adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are important, some believe they are incompatible. This study investigated the interplay between physicians' intentions to engage in SDM and their intention to pursue CPGs. METHODS: To evaluate the impact of physician education in SDM on using antibiotics to treat acute respiratory infections, this study housed within a clustered randomized trial evaluated physicians' intentions to both engage in SDM and follow CPGs. A self-administered questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior evaluated both behavioral intentions and their respective determinants (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) at study entry and exit. We used path analysis to explore the relationships between intentions. We performed statistical analyzes using the maximum likelihood method and the variance-covariance matrix. Goodness of fit indices included the chi-square statistic, the comparative index of fit, and the root mean square error of approximation. RESULTS: We analyzed 244 responses on entry and 236 responses on exit. In the control group, we observed that, at entry, physicians' intentions to engage in SDM (r = 0, t = 0.03) did not affect their intention to follow CPGs; however, their intention to follow CPGs (r = -0.31 t = -2.82) negatively affected their intention to join SDM. At exit, neither behavioral intention affected the other. In the experimental group, neither behavioral intention at entry affected the other;"" at exit, intention to follow CPGs (r = -0.15 t = -2.02) slightly negatively affected intention to join SDM, although intention to join SDM still affected intention to use CPGs.

1646,Importance of chronic fatigue syndrome in rehabilitation medicine – status and perspectives,"From a clinical perspective, chronic fatigue or fatigue appears to be an important factor in rehabilitation. But it is, above all, a phenomenon that can be defined as a function according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (JCF) caused by chronic diseases or chronic excessive stress. The clinical and sociomedical ranking of chronic fatigue or exhaustion in terms of rehabilitation was discussed in terms of psychiatric rehabilitation, methodology, sociology and practical rehabilitation within the framework of a Workshop at the 12th Rehabilitation Science Colloquium in 2003, and implications for future research were discussed. drawn. The definition of chronic fatigue is primarily based not only on the feeling of chronic fatigue, but also on the phenomena of disturbed concentration, physical discomfort, headache and ""impulse"" and mood disorders. A psychiatric diagnosis associated with chronic fatigue symptoms is neurasthenia, reached according to strictly defined criteria. Depressive disorder is one of the most important differential diagnoses in this area. Examinations by GPs revealed that approximately 90% of patients diagnosed as suffering from psychovegetative disorders fully agree with the diagnosis of neurasthenia. Neurasthenia resulted in more frequent episodes of work disability than somatization disorders and other psychosomatic diagnoses. On the basis of the ""IRES"" scale ""vital exhaustion"", even drastic changes become evident in approximately 50% to 90% of patients entering rehabilitation, depending on the individual indication range. Not surprisingly, most of the pathological findings are related to patients undergoing psychosomatic rehabilitation because in such cases there is overlap with the symptoms of psychosomatic diseases. However, it is noteworthy that fatigue symptoms are observed in up to 50% of patients in somatic-oriented orthopedic rehabilitation. Preliminary studies have shown that although pathological manifestations are still abundant at follow-up examinations, these symptoms can definitively be improved within the framework of rehabilitation. Significantly severe levels of ""vital exhaustion"" and ""occupational exhaustion"" are also seen in rheumatology patients undergoing somatic rehabilitation. This is consistent with the relevant case history details by many male and female patients. Therefore, it seems necessary to tailor the rehabilitation intervention to both the psychovegetative and medical behavioral aspects of this symptom. Scientific classification of all chronic fatigue in terms of rehabilitation requires classification of relevant functions within the framework of the ICF. To this end, it will be necessary to use a systematic consensus process among experts for the assignment of relevant functions, on the one hand, to conduct patient inquiries within the scope of cross-sectional studies. This is the basis for the development of appropriate assessment tools for use in prospective studies to systematically assess the impact on functions, and in particular the impact on activities and participation.",0,0,

1648,Simulation training as a single intervention does not improve hand hygiene practices: A randomized controlled follow-up study,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate how nurses' critical knowledge of and adherence to current care hand hygiene (HH) guidelines differed between randomly allocated intervention and control groups before and after simulation training in both the simulation setting and clinical practice during a 2-year follow-up period. It was hypothesized that after simulation training, the intervention group's knowledge of and adherence to existing HH guidelines might increase compared to a control group. METHODS: A prospective, parallel, randomized controlled trial with repeated measurements was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Oulu, Finland. Thirty of the 40 ICU nurses initially randomized participated in baseline measures"";"" 17 of them completed all study procedures. Participants' HH compliance was observed only in high-risk contact situations before and after endotracheal aspiration events using a direct, non-participant observation method. Participants' HR knowledge was assessed at the end of each observation session. RESULTS: Overall HH compliance increased from a baseline value of 40.8% to 50.8% at the last post-intervention measurement at 24 months (P = .002). However, the linear mixed model did not detect any significant group (P = .77) or time group interactions (P = .17) between study groups after 2 years of simulation training. In addition, the simulation training did not have any effect on the participants' knowledge of HR. RESULTS: After a single simulation training session, intensive care nurses' knowledge of and adherence to current HR guidelines remained below target behavior rates.",0,0,
1649,Sleep disturbance in adults with cancer: a systematic review of the evidence for best practices in assessment and management for clinical practice.,"Sleep disturbance is common in cancer with detrimental effects on health outcomes. Sleep problems are rarely identified or addressed in cancer practice. The purpose of this review was to determine the evidence base for the evaluation and management of cancer-related sleep disorder (insomnia and insomnia syndrome) for oncology practice. The health literature search included gray literature data sources and empirical databases from June 2004 to June 2012. The evidence was reviewed by a Canadian Sleep Specialist Panel, made up of nurses, psychologists, primary care physicians, oncologists, and doctors specializing in sleep disorders. researchers and guide methodologists to develop clinical practice recommendations for pan-Canadian use reported in a separate article. Three clinical practice guidelines and 12 randomized, controlled trials were identified as the main source of evidence. Additional guidelines and systematic reviews were also reviewed for evidence-based recommendations for the assessment and management of insomnia not necessarily in cancer. The need to routinely screen for sleep disorders has been identified, and randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence suggests benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy for improving sleep quality in cancer. Sleep disturbance is a common problem in cancer that needs further recognition in clinical practice and future research.",0,0,
1650,"Smoking in emergency chest pain patients: motivation to quit, risk perception, and physician intervention.","The feasibility of the emergency department (ED) as a setting for smoking interventions was studied among 159 adult patients presenting with chest pain (38% were smokers). Subjects were admitted to a 24-hour observation unit (OU) to rule out myocardial infarction. Using the AHCPR guidelines as a model, we examined the frequency and extent of physician interventions for smoking. We also evaluated patients' perceptions of risk from smoking and their motivation to quit. The results show that emergency physicians provide incomplete and inconsistent response. When most of the patients were asked whether they smoked, only half were advised to quit and very few were offered help with quitting. Nearly half of the smokers had a low perceived risk from smoking. However, more than three-quarters were willing to seek smoking cessation counseling while in the emergency room. The emergency department may be a suitable setting to initiate smoking cessation counseling for certain high-risk populations.",0,0,
1651,Smoking cessation activities by general practitioners and practice nurses,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the self-reported behaviors, attitudes and knowledge of general practitioners and practice nurses about smoking cessation. DESIGN AND ENVIRONMENT: Two mail surveys"" with randomized national samples of 303 GPs (survey 1) and 459 GPs (survey 2) covering England and Wales; effective response rates were 75% and 96%, respectively. RESULTS: Questionnaire 1, found that 96% of GPs agreed that the anti-smoking intervention was part of their role, and nearly all (99%) said they recorded their smoking status when patients were enrolled; 57% said they routinely updated their smoking status record, 50% 76% said they recommend smokers to quit smoking if they cannot quit. A large majority (83%) said they recommend or prescribe nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Despite many general practitioners (86%), NRT' Thought the drugs were effective, only a minority thought they were worth the cost (47%) or needed to be on a NHS prescription (32%). There was little evidence that prior education was associated with more activity, positive attitudes, or more knowledge. Survey 2 showed that almost all practice nurses (99%) agreed that smoking intervention is part of their role, and 95% advised patients to quit at least occasionally; 71% said they advise smokers to quit most or all of the consultations. The majority (74%) said they recommend NRT to their patients. As with GPs, most nurses felt that nicotine replacement was effective (79%), but fewer (42%) felt the cost was justified and only half (53%) needed NHS prescriptions. Nurses who said they were educated about smoking cessation were more active, had a more positive attitude, and were more knowledgeable about quitting. CONCLUSION: General practitioners and practice nurses accepted the intervention. smoking was an important part of their role, and a large majority reported that they interfered with at least some smokers. This provides a promising basis for moving forward in terms of introducing new smoke. However, it is hoped that improvements can be made in terms of updating the registries and frequency of intervention and the cost-effectiveness of NRT being recognized as a life-saving intervention.",0,0,
1652,Smoking cessation counseling beliefs and behaviors of outpatient oncology service providers,"OBJECTIVE: Many cancer patients continue to smoke after diagnosis, which increases the risk of treatment complications, reduces treatment efficacy, secondary cancers, and decreases survival. Outpatient oncology providers may not be using the ""teachable moment"" of a cancer diagnosis to provide smoking cessation help. PROVIDERS AND METHODS: Physicians and mid-level providers (n = 74) providing outpatient oncology services completed an online questionnaire on smoking cessation counseling behaviors, beliefs, and perceived barriers. The outpatient medical records of 120 breast, lung, head and neck, colon, prostate, and acute leukemia cancer patients were reviewed to evaluate current smoking cessation assessment and intervention documentation practices. RESULTS: Providers reported that they rate smoking widely in new patients (82.4% often or always), but rates at subsequent visits decreased for both current smokers and recent quitters. The rates of recommending patients to quit smoking were also high (86.5% often or always), but <30% of providers reported that they often or always intervene with smokers (for example, nicotine replacement therapy or other medications, self-help materials and/or references). Only 30% of providers reported that they often or always followed patients to assess quit-related progress. Few providers (18.1%) reported a high level of confidence in their ability to counsel smokers. The lack of motivation of the patients was determined as the most important obstacle to quitting smoking. CONCLUSIONS: While beliefs about providing cessation services to smokers are generally positive, few providers commonly report providing interventions beyond quit advice. Additional education and clinical-based interventions can improve adherence to tobacco cessation practice guidelines in the outpatient oncology setting.",0,0,

METHODS: WIC (Special Supplementary Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) program staff, obstetricians, and pediatric clinicians at 6 community health centers were asked to complete the questionnaires. Smoking intervention practices (performance), knowledge and attitudes, and organizational facilitators were measured. Performance-related factors were investigated by analysis of variance and regression analysis. RESULTS: Performance scores differed significantly by clinic and provider type. Providers at gynecology clinics had the highest scores, while providers at pediatric clinics had the lowest scores. Nurse practitioners and nutritionists had higher scores than other providers. Clinical type, greater knowledge about smoking, older age, and perception of smoking cessation as a priority were independently associated with better counseling performance. RESULTS: Average performance scores showed room for improvement in all groups. Low scores for performance of steps beyond assessment and advice indicate that national guidelines need emphasis on assistance and follow-up steps.

1655,Smoking cessation in family medicine: effects of a regional health education center training program,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many clinicians have not received adequate training in smoking cessation. We examined the effects of a tobacco education program on clinician behavior, attitudes, knowledge, and comfort with smoking cessation. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, family medicine residents and faculty completed a pretest, followed by an educational intervention that included smoking cessation resources, motivational interviewing, and presentations on the neurobiology of addiction and pharmacotherapy. After 3 months, participants completed a post-intervention questionnaire. The results were analyzed using chi-square tests to examine the effects of training. RESULTS: Thirty-three residents and faculty completed the pre-training questionnaire and 25 completed the post-training questionnaire. After the training, participants became more familiar and comfortable with the Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines (P < .0001). No significant differences were found in performance of 5 As (Ask, Advise, Evaluate, Help, and Arrange) or performance of other behaviors, including providing assistance with counseling, quit plans, resources, or pharmacotherapy. There was no improvement in knowledge of specific intervention plans or attitudes to identify and counsel smokers. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary tobacco education program increases the clinician's familiarity and comfort with practice guidelines and can contribute to improved care activities that promote a healthy lifestyle. Future research should explore other interventions that have the potential to change delivery patterns on a larger scale. Future studies should also evaluate the impact of educational programs on patient-centered outcomes.",0,0,

This review provides an overview of the intervention for smokers presenting in primary care. Strategies used in smoking cessation counseling differed according to the patient's readiness to quit. For smokers who do not intend to quit, physicians should inform and sensitize patients about tobacco use and cessation, particularly by personalizing the benefits of quitting and challenging smokers' beliefs. For smokers who are maladjusted, physicians should use motivational strategies, such as discussing barriers and solutions to quitting. For smokers who are ready to quit, the physician should demonstrate strong support, help set a quit date, prescribe replacement therapy and/or pharmaceutical treatments for nicotine addiction, such as bupropion, with instructions for use, and recommend behavioral strategies to prevent relapse.",0,0,
1657,Smoking: Can we really make a difference?,"The enormous health benefits of quitting smoking are now well known. Doctors have a vital role in motivating smokers and initiating cessation initiatives. The mainstay of the National Health Service smoking cessation strategy should be the routine provision of brief opportunistic intervention in primary care, supported by referral to a specialist smoking cessation service. There is an urgent need to significantly increase the number of smokers referred to specialist smoking cessation services and better communication channels among various agencies by general practitioners, other members of the primary care team, and those working in acute hospital trusts. The use of pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion) in combination with behavioral support produces higher quit rates than either component alone and is the most effective way to help smokers quit. Smokers who quit smoking often relapse and therefore need help over and over again.",0,0,

The paucity of evidence of personal benefit for incidental findings has hampered clinical guidelines. Our aim was to estimate personal benefit for complex information from incidental genomic findings. METHODS: We used a separate selection experiment to assess participants' personal benefit for the following attributes: disease penetration, disease treatability, disease severity, carrier status, and cost. Study participants were selected from the Canadian public. We analyzed the data with a mixed logit model. RESULTS: A total of 1200 respondents completed our survey (available in English and French). Participants valued information about high penetration disorders, but expressed it as unhelpful for information on low penetration disorders. In a scenario where clinicians were reporting on high-penetration, medically treatable disorders, the average willingness to pay to receive incidental findings was $445 (95% confidence interval [CI] $322-567), but only 66% (95% CI 63%) of respondents. -71%) stated that they would prefer to receive information in this scenario. On average, participants rated a significant value ($725, 95% CI 600-$850) in having a choice of what kind of findings they would receive, including information about high penetration, treatable disorders, or high penetration. disorders with or without current treatment. The estimated uptake for this scenario was 76% (95% CI 72%-79%). COMMENT: Most participants valued inclusion of incidental findings, but personal benefit depended on the type of finding, and not all participants wanted incidental results regardless of potential health effects. These results suggest that to maximize benefit, participant-level preferences should inform the decision about whether to return random findings.",0,0,

Little is known about the effects of these sources of bias and variation. Purpose: To summarize the evidence for factors that may lead to bias or variability in the results of diagnostic accuracy studies. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and BIOSIS, and methodological databases of the Center for Review and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaborating Center. Methodological experts were contacted during the diagnostic tests. Study Selection: Studies investigating the effects of bias and variation on measures of test performance were eligible for inclusion evaluated by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Inconsistencies were resolved by discussion. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and controlled by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis: The best documented effects of bias and variation were found for demographics, disease prevalence and severity, partial confirmation bias, clinical review bias, and observer and instrument variation. The amount of evidence for other sources was limited, such as skewed participant selection, incomplete or inappropriate reference standard, differential confirmation bias, and review bias.

METHODS: A 19-item questionnaire was mailed to participants in a large genome research consortium 18 months after a baseline questionnaire. We describe the stability of parental attitudes regarding (a) sharing of genomic research results, (b) validating children in genomic research, (c) researchers' responsibilities, and (d) responsibilities to the extended family. We also explore their experience in getting results. RESULTS: Of the 170 original participants, 154 (91%) responded. Most respondents expressed a positive entitlement to receive incidental genomic research findings (85%), including when curative treatment was unknown (85%). Only 3% found the decision to return the results to an independent committee acceptable. Researchers with parents (42%) or physicians (17%) were considered responsible for transmitting research results to children when they reached adulthood. Most respondents (74%) indicated that the results should be shared with the potentially affected extended family. These results are very similar to the results of the basic survey. All participants who received genomic results would do this again and report actions similar to the attitudes they expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' views on genomic research remain stable over time.

1666,Standard operating procedure changed the behavior of prehospital intensive care anesthetists: a quality control study,"INTRODUCTION: The ability of standard operating procedures to improve prehospital critical care by changing prehospital physician behavior is uncertain. We report data from a prospective quality control study on the effect on the behavior of prehospital intensive care anesthetists to perform a standard operating procedure for prehospital controlled ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthesiologists from eight prehospital critical care teams in the Central Denmark Region prospectively recorded prehospital advanced airway management data according to a Utstein-style template. We collected pre-intervention data from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012, followed the standard operating procedure on February 1, 2012, and collected post-intervention data from February 1, 2012 to October 31, 2012. We included transplanted patients of all ages who needed controlled ventilation. It is treated with prehospital endotracheal intubation or insertion of a supraglottic airway device. The aim was to evaluate whether the development and implementation of a standard operating procedure for controlled ventilation during transport could change the behavior of prehospital critical care anesthetists and thereby increase the use of automatic ventilators in these patients. RESULTS: Implementation of a standard operative procedure increased the overall prevalence of automatic ventilator use in transplant patients requiring controlled ventilation from 0.40 (0.34-0.47) to 0.74 (0.69-0.80), with a prevalence ratio of 1.85 (1.57-2.19). (p = 0.00). The prevalence of automatic ventilator use in transplant traumatic brain injury patients requiring controlled ventilation increased from 0.44 (0.26-0.62) to 0.85 (0.62-0.97), and the prevalence rate was 1.94 (1.26-3.0) (p = 0.0039). The prevalence of automatic ventilator use increased from 0.39 (0.26-0.48) to 0.69 (0.58-0.78) in transplant patients after return of spontaneous circulation after prehospital cardiac arrest, with a prevalence ratio of 1.79 (1.36-2.35) (p = 0.00) .

1669,Adhering to minimum standards: implementing antibiotic management in the ICU,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, antimicrobial management programs are a mandatory component of hospital accreditation. Good documentation on anti-microbial prescribing aids communication and can improve prescribing practice in multi-decision makers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and implement an intervention to improve antimicrobial prescribing practice in a 24-bed intensive care unit in a tertiary adult hospital. METHODS: We conducted a prospective collaborative quality improvement study in four phases (observation, reflection, application, evaluation). Key audits and surveys of antimicrobial prescribing practices identified barriers and enablers to good prescribing practices. A customized intervention was then administered for 6 weeks and included a yellow drug registration label, quarterly training sessions, and ICU-specific empirical antimicrobial prescribing guidelines. After administration, effects were monitored for 1 year with serial antimicrobial prescribing audits. Primary outcomes were start date, planned end date or review date, and clear documentation of an antibiotic indication. All of these were considered 'minimum standards' for an antimicrobial prescription in the drug registry. RESULTS: Documentation of minimum standards specifically addressed by the improved label (start date (72% to 90%, P < 0.001), end date (16% to 63%, P < 0.001), antimicrobial indication documented in drug chart (58%) up to 83%, P < 0.01)). Overall, adherence to all three minimum standards (start date, end date, and indicator) increased from 41/306 (13%) to 306/492 (63%) (P < 0.001). A year after implementation, the yellow tag was embedded in the daily practice.

1670,stimulant drugs,"Stimulants are an important element in the treatment of ADHD. Carefully designed stimulant trials found a significant improvement in ADHD core behaviors in 65-75% of subjects with ADHD. Most standard stimulants are rapidly absorbed, with behavioral effects appearing within 30 minutes, peaking in one to three hours, and disappearing within five hours. Despite the risk of peer teasing and additional adult supervision requirements, doses are often required at school. The mechanism by which stimulants reduce hyperactivity is not fully understood, but they improve impulsivity and activity levels. Few controlled evaluations over a period of more than one year show a clear persistence of drug effects over time. A carefully tailored treatment program with methylphenidate is more effective at reducing symptoms of hyperactivity than an intensive behavioral and cognitive intervention program. The combination of stimulants with psychosocial interventions in ADHD offers several advantages over drug therapy alone. It is difficult to recommend undisputed practice guidelines that would be appropriate everywhere. It is imperative that clinicians prescribing stimulants monitor drug use appropriately, ensuring that the drug is not abused by the child's family, peers, or school dispensers. Polypharmacy should only be initiated by a specialist service and the combination of methylphenidate and clonidine should be used with caution. Apart from ADHD, stimulants are helpful in narcolepsy, resistant depression, and partial attention and hyperactivity syndromes. Big gaps in knowledge persist"";"" The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics of stimulating effects need further study. The details of stimulant administration regimens appear to have a major influence on the response obtained. More research is needed, comparing different forms of combination with psychological interventions, preferably in realistic practice settings, investigating effects in groups of children outside the core of school-age children with typical ADHD: preschoolers, adults, those with partial syndromes (such as inattention) and those with co-morbid disorders. .",0,0,

1672,Strategies for rehabilitation professionals to put evidence-based knowledge into practice: a systematic review.,"RATIONALE: Rehabilitation clinicians need to stay up-to-date on best practices, especially because adherence to clinical guidelines can significantly improve patient outcomes. However, little is known about the benefits of information translation interventions for these professionals. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of single- or multi-component information translation interventions to improve rehabilitation clinicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors. METHODS: A systematic review of 7 databases conducted to identify studies evaluating information translation interventions specific to occupational and physical therapists. RESULTS: 12 studies met eligibility criteria. For physical therapists, participation in an active multi-component information translation intervention resulted in improved evidence-based knowledge and practice behaviors compared to passive dissemination strategies. These gains did not translate into a change in clinicians' attitudes towards best practices. For occupational therapists, there are no studies examining the use of multi-component interventions"";"" Studies of single interventions suggest limited evidence of efficacy for all measured outcomes. CONCLUSION: Although this review recommends the use of active, multi-component information translation interventions to improve physiotherapists' knowledge and practice behaviors, additional research is needed to understand the impact of these strategies on occupational therapists.

Reporting of observational studies is often of poor quality. Poor reporting hinders the assessment of a study's strengths and weaknesses and the generalizability of its results. Taking into account experimental evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the reporting quality of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a 22-item checklist for the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of the articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies, and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement guides authors on how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical evaluation and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors, and readers. This explanatory and detailing document aims to improve the use, understanding and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item is presented. For each item, one or more published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided.

1675,Stress as a cardiovascular risk factor,"Stress is an organism's response to a stressor with various adverse health consequences, including the development of atherosclerosis. Stress can cause myocardial ischemia, rhythm disturbances, platelet stimulation, increased blood viscosity through hemoconcentration, as well as endothelial dysfunction and coronary vasoconstriction in the presence of arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Psychosocial risk factors may also lead to the development and clinical consequences of arteriosclerosis. The five most important psychosocial risk factors are: depression, anxiety, personality factors, social isolation and chronic life stress. Various components are responsible for the fact that life events or certain psychosocial factors can lead to a stress response. Psychosocial risk factors have direct pathophysiological implications, but they also affect lifestyle and behavior. A variety of stress management intervention programs have proven effective. It has been shown that psychosocial intervention together with cardiac rehabilitation programs reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",0,0,
1676,Stress echocardiography in heart failure,"Echocardiography is capable of noninvasively investigating hemodynamic variables during pharmacological or exercise stress testing in patients with heart failure. In this review, we detail some of the important potential applications of stress echocardiography in patients with heart failure. In patients with coronary artery disease and chronic LV dysfunction, dobutamine stress echocardiography can distinguish between viable and fibrotic tissue to make adequate clinical decisions. Exercise testing together with echocardiographic monitoring is a method of obtaining accurate information in the evaluation of functional capacity and prognosis. Functional mitral regurgitation is a common finding in patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy, and stress echocardiography in the form of exercise or pharmacological protocols may be useful to evaluate mitral regurgitation behavior. It is clinically useful to investigate the presence of contractile reserve in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, such as to screen for or monitor the presence of latent myocardial dysfunction in patients exposed to cardiotoxic agents. In addition, in patients with suspected diastolic heart failure and normal systolic function, exercise echocardiography may demonstrate the presence of such dysfunction and determine that it is sufficient to limit exercise tolerance. Finally, in aortic stenosis, dobutamine echocardiography can distinguish severe stenosis from non-severe stenosis in patients with low transvalvular gradients and depressed left ventricular function.",0,0,
1677,Structured follow-up by GPs after intentional self-poisoning: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the follow-up of patients after intentional self-poisoning (DSP). The aim was to examine whether structured follow-up by GPs improves treatment content, adherence to treatment, and satisfaction with treatment after discharge from emergency departments. METHODS: This was a blinded assignment multicenter randomized trial. Five emergency services and general practices in the collection area participated. 202 patients discharged from the emergency department after DSP assignment. The intervention is a structured follow-up by the GP over a 6-month period with at least five consultations to motivate patients to follow treatment, to assess personal problems and suicidal thoughts, and with written guidelines for GPs. case of suicide crisis. Outcomes were data from the Registry to control and pay reimbursements to healthcare providers (KUHR) and through questionnaires sent to patients and GPs. After 3 and 6 months, the frequency and content of communication with the GP and adherence to GP consultations and treatment in general were recorded. Satisfaction with the general treatment received and with the family doctor was measured with the EUROPEP scale. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group received significantly more consultations than the control group (mean 6.7 vs 4.5 (p = 0.004)). The intervention group was significantly more likely to spend more time listening to their GPs listening to their personal problems (93.1% vs. 59.4% (p = 0.002)) and GP involvement in medical decisions (87.5% vs. 54). was satisfied. 8% (p = 0.009)). The intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the treatment overall than the control group (79 vs 51% (p = 0.026)). CONCLUSIONS: GP guidelines and structured, improved follow-up after discharge of the DSP patient increased the number of consultations in general practice and satisfaction with aftercare. Consistent with previous research, interventional studies are still needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01342809. Registered April 18, 2011.",0,0,
1678,Structured smoking cessation training in cardiology wards for healthcare professionals: a prospective study.,"Background: Smoking is an important cardiovascular risk factor and smoking cessation is mandatory in patients hospitalized for a cardiovascular event. This study aimed to evaluate a systems-based approach to assisting hospitalized smokers to quit and to identify implementation barriers. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study following qualitative analysis of staff interviews. METHODS: The prospective intervention study evaluated the effects of applying standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the provision of counseling and pharmacotherapy to smokers admitted to cardiology services on counseling frequency. In addition, a qualitative analysis of staff interviews was conducted to examine determinants of doctor and nurse behavior"";"" this sought to understand barriers in terms of motivation, ability and/or opportunity. RESULTS: A total of 150 smokers were included in the study (75 before and 75 after SOP). The proportion of patients who reported receiving cessation counseling from doctors and nurses before the implementation of the SOPs was 6.7% and 1.3%, respectively. Following the SOP implementation, these rates increased to 38.7% (p < 0.001) and 2.7% (p = 0.56), respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed that lack of motivation, for example role mismatch, appeared to be a major barrier. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of a set of standard operating procedures for smoking cessation advice was effective for doctors, not nurses. Analysis of the barriers to implementation highlighted a lack of motivation rather than talent or opportunity as an important factor to be addressed.",0,1,
1679,Study confirms value of STD therapy in preventing HIV transmission,"PIP: An intervention was conducted in the Mwanza Region of Tanzania to determine whether improved treatment in rural health centers and dispensaries for non-HIV/AIDS sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) could reduce the incidence of new HIV infections. Medical assistants and nurses at six rural health centers were trained in the syndromic management of STDs, and health center staff were encouraged to counsel their patients, offer them condoms, and seek referral of sex partners for treatment. The centers received the cheapest effective drugs to treat the major STD syndromes. Healthcare workers trained as supervisors visited each center every 8 weeks to control drug supply and patient records, provide refresher training, and ensure compliance with syndromic management guidelines. In addition, a cohort of 1,000 adults in communities served by six health centers was interviewed and tested for HIV at the start of the study and 2 years after the start of the intervention. Next, the number of new cases of HIV infection occurring in the cohort was compared with those occurring in another cohort selected from communities served by health centers where advanced STD treatment was not provided. During the 2-year study period, 11,632 cases of STD were treated at the centers. The intervention was found to reduce the number of new HIV infections occurring during the study period by 42%. This reduction was seen in both sexes and all age groups, but was particularly evident among women aged 15-24. Survey results suggest that the reduction in HIV incidence is the result of improved STD treatment rather than changes in sexual behavior. Preliminary calculations show a cost of approximately US$300 per HIV infection prevented.",0,0,
1680,new curriculum study on electronic communication in family medicine residencies,"Electronic communication between physicians and patients is common, but can carry risks for users, both for patients and physicians. Little is known about electronic communication between physicians and patients, and even less about electronic communication during residency. We examined knowledge and practices before and after controlled testing of a new curriculum that teaches e-mail communication with patients using residents and faculty at 16 family medicine residencies in the United States. Both faculty and residents demonstrated a lack of knowledge of privacy and encryption prior to curriculum delivery, little familiarity with published guidelines for doctor-patient email, and non-compliance with documentation requirements. Posttests revealed greater improvement in knowledge and appropriate behavior regarding patient-physician email in the intervention group compared to the control groups (mean intervention increase 13 points [t=-4.065, P<.01], mean control increase 5 points [ t=-2.015, P<.05]). The increased uncertainty among intervention assistants about comfort with patient email is an interesting result that may result from increased awareness of the issues but limited time devoted to assimilation. Recommendations for the implementation of the curriculum are presented.",0,0,
1681,Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial: Applicability and impact of cardiovascular absolute risk assessment in Australian general practice.,"BACKGROUND: Although cardiovascular absolute risk (CVAR) assessment has been recommended for use in Australian general practice for several years, there is ongoing uncertainty about its application and impact. Our previous work had developed a versatile application model. This study aims to explore both the feasibility of using this model and the impact of CVAR assessment and management on general practice clinical processes and patient care. STUDY DESIGN: This cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted to include general practitioners (GPs) in Sydney, other practice staff, and patients aged 45 to 69 years without pre-existing cardiovascular disease. METHODS: A total of 32 practices (40 general practitioners) and 1320 patients will be recruited. Randomization will be done at the application level. The intervention group of family physicians will be trained to use a CVAR delivery model, while the control group of family physicians will continue with usual care. Study outcomes include clinical processes, patient risk, use of lifestyle intervention, and prescribing of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. Data will be collected and analyzed using mixed methods. Study results before and after intervention will be compared and the 2 groups will be compared after adjusting for baseline difference and clustering factors. CONCLUSION: This trial will be the first study in Australian general practice and one of the few international studies to evaluate the impact of implementing CVAR assessment and management. The results of this study will help improve primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and inform guidelines for clinical practice and implementation of other health interventions.",0,0,
1682,Examining practice abolition in health: an analysis of funded research grants,"Background Here, the study of practice removal, defined as the reduction or cessation of use of a healthcare service or practice provided to patients by healthcare professionals and systems, has gained interest in recent years. Elimination of ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate and/or low-value healthcare services and practices is important to reduce harm to the patient, improve care processes, and reduce healthcare costs. A better understanding of the state of science is needed to guide future goals and funding initiatives. To this end, we identified decommissioning research grants funded by the United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Agency for Health Services Research and Quality (AHRQ). Methods From fiscal 2000 to 2017, we used systematic methods to search for, identify, and disclose decommissioning research grants funded at all 27 NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) and AHRQs. Research grants in the NIH Inquiry, Imaging and Reporting (QVR) system. Two coders identified eligible grants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A codebook was developed, pilot tested and revised before coding the final sample full grant applications. Results A total of 1277 grants were identified through the QVR system"";"" After removing the duplicates, 542 remained. After the multi-stage conformity assessment and review process, 20 grant applications were coded. Many grants were funded by the NIH (n?=?15), fewer by AHRQ, and the majority funded between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 (n?=?11). Grant proposals focused on de-executing a range of health services and practices (eg drugs, therapies, screening tests) in various health areas (eg cancer, cardiovascular disease) and distribution settings (eg hospitals, nursing homes, schools). Grants proposing to use a variety of study designs and research methods (eg experimental, observational, mixed methods) to achieve study objectives. Results Based on a systematic portfolio analysis of NIH and AHRQ-funded research grants over the past 17 years, relatively few have focused on removing ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or low-value health practice. services and practices provided to patients by healthcare practitioners and systems. Strategies for raising the profile and expanding the field of research on decoupling are discussed.",0,0,
1683,Success after periprosthetic joint infection treatment: A Delphi-based international multidisciplinary consensus.,"BACKGROUND: The lack of agreement on what constitutes successful treatment of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) makes it difficult to compare the different management strategies used in clinical practice and research studies. QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to establish a consensus definition for success after PJI treatment and to provide a universal, multidimensional framework for reporting studies on PJI treatment. METHODS: A basic two-step Delphi method was used to arrive at a consensus definition. We invited 159 international experts (orthopedic surgeons, infectious disease specialists, and clinical researchers) from 17 countries to participate""; 59 participated in the first round and 42 in the second round. The final definition consisted of all statements that reached strong agreement. (80% or more of respondents considers a criterion for defining success) RESULTS: Consensus definition of successfully treated PJI: (1) eradication of infection characterized by a healed wound without fistula, drainage or pain, and absence of infection relapse caused by the same organism species; (2 ) no subsequent surgical intervention for infection after reimplantation surgery; and (3) the absence of PJI-related deaths (due to sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, etc.). The Delphi panel agreed to define medium-term outcomes as those reported 5 or more years after definitive PJI surgery, and long-term outcomes as those reported 10 or more years after surgery. Although there was no consensus on the definition of short-term outcomes, 71% of respondents agreed that it was acceptable to define it 2 years after definitive PJI surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This multidimensional definition of success after PJI treatment can be used to report and compare outcomes of treatment for this catastrophic complication.

1684,"Successful implementation of a guideline with peer comparisons, education and positive doctor feedback","The purpose of this study was to determine whether peer comparisons, an educational intervention, and positive physician feedback would reduce the rank of knee X-ray studies. To encourage the use of the Ottawa decision rule for knee radiography, we prospectively examined the sequence of knee X-ray studies for patients presenting with knee injuries before and after an education program. Doctors were able to specifically compare their individual baseline X-ray usage data with those of their colleagues. Although acceptance of the rule was optional, both verbal and written feedback encouraged consideration of the rule in clinical decision making. Percent Abnormal Results (PAR is defined as the percentage of X-ray studies showing a fracture or effusion), as well as the percentage of knee injury patients who received X-ray studies were calculated before and after the training meeting. The results of the study showed that the percentage of patients presenting with knee injuries who received X-ray studies decreased by 23%. In addition, PAR increased by 58.4% between the two study periods. As a result, physician behavior can be changed in a positive way with reinforcement. Peer comparisons, education, and positive physician feedback reduced test ordering by physicians, even if they did not mandate the use of a protocol. The PAR is a useful outcome measure for monitoring physician use.",0,1,
1685,Successful implementation of neonatal pain and sedation protocol in NICU,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the application of neonatal pain and sedation protocol in 2 intensive care units. METHODS: The response began with an assessment of local practices, problems and staff satisfaction. We then developed and implemented the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. The protocol included well-defined strategies for both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions based on regular evaluation of a translated version of the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale and titration of analgesic and sedative therapy according to target scores. Healthcare personnel were trained in assessment using video-based training and bedside instruction. We also performed reassessment, retraining and random quality checks. The frequency and quality of assessments, pharmacological therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and outcome were compared at baseline (12 months before administration) and 12 months after administration. RESULTS: Cumulative median (interquartile range) opiate dose (initial dose 1.4 [0.5-5.9] mg/kg vs. intervention group dose 2.7 [0.4-57] mg/kg morphine equivalent""; P = .002), per person pharmacological interventions sustained episodes of sedation/analgesia (4 [2-10] vs. 6 [2-13]; P = .005) and overall staff satisfaction (doctors: 31% vs 89%; P < .001; nurses : 17% vs. 55%; ""P < .001) increased after administration. The duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, and adverse outcomes were similar before and after administration. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the neonatal pain and sedation protocol in 2 intensive care units resulted in an increase in opium prescription, pharmacological interventions, and staff satisfaction without affecting the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, and adverse outcomes.",0,0,
1686,Successful reduction in catheter-related urinary tract infections: focus on nurse-directed catheter removal.,"Background Despite the use of sterile technique for catheter placement, closed drainage systems, and structured day care plans, catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) occur regularly in acute care hospitals. We believe that a significant reduction in CAUTI rates can only be achieved by reducing the use of urinary catheters. Methods We used an interventional study of a hospital-wide, multidisciplinary program to reduce urinary catheter use and CAUTIs in all patient care units at a 300-bed community teaching hospital in Connecticut. Our primary focus was the implementation of the nurse-guided urinary catheter removal protocol. This protocol was linked to the doctor's instructions for catheter insertion. Three additional elements included physician documentation of catheter insertion criteria, a device-specific chart module added to the physician's electronic progress notes, and fortnightly unit-specific feedback on catheter use rates and CAUTI rates in a multidisciplinary forum. Results Over a 36-month period, we achieved a hospital-wide 50% reduction in catheter use and a 70% reduction in CAUTIs, but there was wide variation in catheter reduction efforts, ranging from 4% (delivery) to 74% from unit to unit. % (telemetry). Conclusion Urinary catheter use, and ultimately CAUTI rates, can be effectively reduced by diligent implementation of relatively few evidence-based interventions. Aggressive implementation of the nurse-guided catheter removal protocol was associated with lower rates of catheter use and lower infection rates.",0,1,
1687,Suicide: procedure in an emergency,"Emergency physicians (APs), paramedics, and emergency room personnel play an increasingly important role in the medical and psychological emergency treatment of patients after a suicide attempt, as well as in the crisis response of people with acute suicidality. This article aims to provide an overview of the prevalence rates, methods of suicide or suicide attempt, and the problems faced by ES when treating these patients. In addition, concepts that allow for an adequate risk assessment for suicide and primary crisis intervention options are presented. Paramedics and intensive care clinicians are increasingly confronted with this complex process, which has social, personal and medical aspects. Clear guidelines are a prerequisite for treating people in suicidal crises and/or after suicide attempts and to provide safe and optimal care for this often heterogeneous group of patients. The initial assessment of the acute danger of suicide is particularly important because of the consequences and a clear approach to dealing with suicidal people has been demonstrated. In addition, legal principles are presented.",0,0,
1688,Evaluation of suicide and violence in psychiatry,"Psychiatrists are expected to increasingly anticipate and prevent their clients' suicidal and violent/murder urges. This article reviews the available literature and research in these areas. While debate continues about whether the clinician can successfully predict violence or suicidal behavior in their patients, the weight of studies indicates that predicting suicide and individual violence may not be possible with currently available information. To compensate for the limitations of foresight, conservative clinicians deliberately exaggerate suicide or violence to help ensure the safety of their patients and the larger communities in which they live. In addition, clinicians need to perform comprehensive assessments and make sound clinical decisions consistent with perceived risks. Preventive measures for violence remain complex, but clinicians can maximize treatment effects by following specific intervention guidelines. As a minimum, violence-related documents should focus on the rationale for whether treatment interventions are implemented. The chart does not require lengthy notes, but should include a reasonable risk assessment and a description of a prudent course of action.",0,0,

1690,To support clinical practice at the bedside using wireless technology.,"Objectives: Despite studies showing improvements in both standards of care and outcomes with judicious application of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), their clinical use remains low. This randomized controlled trial examined the use of a wireless networked mobile computer (MC) at the bedside by physicians who have access to the emergency room information system, decision support tools (DSTs), and other software options. Methods: Ten volunteer emergency physicians were each randomized using a matched pair design to work five shifts in standard style (desktop [DC] access) and five shifts with a wireless networked MC. Work pattern issues and electronic CPG/DST use were compared using end-of-shift satisfaction surveys and a CPG/DST database review. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine the shift differences. Results: A total of 100 eight-hour shifts were evaluated""; 99% compliance with post-shift questionnaires. Using a seven-point Likert scale (MC values first), MCs were graded as fast (5.04 vs 4.54; p = 0.13) and fit ( 5.08 vs 4.14; p = 0.07) as DCs overall, physicians rated MHs as less efficient (3.18 vs 4.30; p = 0.02), but encouraged more frequent use of DSTs (4.10 vs. 3.47 vs. p = 0.03) without affecting doctor-patient communication (2.78 vs. 2.96; p = 0.51) During the study period, physician's use of the intranet Web application (eCPG) during shifts assigned to the MC, DC (uses/shifts eCPG, 3.6 vs 2.0;"" p = 0.033).

Design Cluster randomized controlled trial. Primary care practice with a practice nurse and at least one eligible patient (maximum HbA1c â€°Â ¥7.5% with oral therapy) in Victoria, Australia. Participants were 266 patients with type 2 diabetes and 74 treatments (mean cluster size 4 (range 1-8) patients), followed for 12 months. Intervention The Elevation model of care intervention included theory-based change in systems of practice and a reorientation of the primary care roles of health professionals. diabetes team. Key ingredients were a role developed for the nurse practitioner in leading insulin initiation and mentoring by a registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials. Main outcome measures The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who switched to insulin, the proportion of those who achieved target HbA1c, and a change in depressive symptoms (patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9), diabetes-specific distress (diabetes scale problem areas, PAID), and overall health. status (quality of life assessment, AQoL-8D). Results� HbA1c improved in both arms, with a clinically significant arm difference (mean difference -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -0.9% to -0.3), favoring intervention. At 12 months, 105/151 (70%) of participants started insulin in intervention treatments compared to 25/115 (22%) in control treatments (odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence interval 4.5 to 15.4, P<0.001). Target HbA1c (Ã7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%) intervention participants and 22 (19%) control participants (odds ratio 2.2, 1.2 to 4.3, P=0.02). Depressive symptoms did not worsen at 12 months (PHQ-9: -1.1 (3.5) v -0.1 (2.9), P=0.05).

1692,Supporting mid-level health workers in Malawi: lessons learned during the implementation of the PALM PLUS package,"BACKGROUND: The Malawian government is committed to the broad dissemination of antiretroviral therapy in Malawi in the public health sector"";"" however, one of the main challenges has been the lack of trained health workers. The Lung Health Plus Practical Approach to HIV/AIDS in Malawi (PALM PLUS) package is an innovative guidance and training intervention that supports middle-level primary care workers to provide front-line integrated primary care. The purpose of this article is to explain the lessons learned in implementing the PALM PLUS package. METHODS: A clinical tool based on algorithm and symptom-based guidelines was adapted to the Malawi context. For the implementation of the PALM PLUS package in 30 health centers, a training program based on educational access principles targeting clinicians, medical assistants and nurses was developed and a tiered training approach was used. Lessons learned were identified during program implementation through collaborating partners and program participants and through review of participation and program evaluation findings. CONCLUSIONS: Key lessons learned for successful program implementation of the PALM PLUS package include the importance of building networks for peer-based support, providing adequate training capacity, linking with continuing professional development accreditation, and maintaining modest in-service training budgets. The main factors limiting implementation were staff turnover and the desire for financial training allowances. CONCLUSIONS: The PALM PLUS approach is a potential model for supporting middle-level healthcare professionals to deliver front-line integrated primary care in low- and middle-income countries and may be useful for future reassignment initiatives.",0,0,

Social psychology explanations and research perspectives,"Social psychology is the discipline that studies thought processes, emotions, and behavior in an interpersonal context. There are three broad subject areas: understanding oneself and others, interpersonal relationships, and group influence. The most important method is experimentation. The value of the social psychological perspective has been demonstrated in relation to the following surgical research questions: How do surgeons arrive at their decisions? How do surgeons confirm their decisions? Why are decision aids (computer support, instructions) so little accepted? How should patients be informed? Which group processes play a role in the operating room? What are the determinants of patient outcomes? Social psychology can expand surgical research in three aspects: better understanding of daily events in the clinical and surgical field, methodologically refined and stronger patient-focused study designs, and new perspectives for better patient outcomes.",0,0,
1694,Surgical treatments for men with benign prostatic enlargement: a cost-effectiveness study.,"OBJECTIVE To determine which surgical treatment is cost-effective for lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic enlargement. DESIGN Care pathways defining reliable treatment strategies were agreed upon by consensus. Cost-benefit analysis used Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. DATA SOURCES Clinical efficacy data came from a systematic review and an individual-level dataset. The utility values came from previous economic assessments. Costs have been calculated from the National Health Service (NHS) and commercial sources. METHODS The Markov model included parameters with associated uncertainty measures describing the health states in which individuals could act at quarterly intervals over 10 years. Consecutive annual cohorts of 25,000 men were included in the model, and the likelihood of cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations. RESULTS There was an 85% probability that endoscopic holmium laser enucleation of the prostate following initial diathermy vaporization of the prostate would be cost-effective at a willingness to pay 20,000 pounds (euro21) if there was no benefit or subsequent recurrence. ,595, $28,686)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Other strategies with diathermy vaporization as initial therapy were generally less expensive and more effective than the current standard of transurethral resection, repeated once as needed. The use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporization resulted in higher costs and was less effective than transurethral resection, and strategies that included microwave thermotherapy and initial minimally invasive treatment were not cost-effective. Findings did not change with extensive sensitivity analyzes. CONCLUSION Due to the limitations of the data used, the result of this economic model should be interpreted with caution. The finding that holmium laser enucleation after initial vaporization for failure or recurrence may be advantageous for both men with lower urinary tract symptoms and healthcare providers requires confirmation in a good quality prospective clinical trial before any changes to current practice are made. Potassium titanyl phosphate laser evaporation was unlikely to be cost-effective in our model, opposing its unrestricted use until further evidence of effectiveness and cost reduction is available.",0,0,

Raising to the level of theory, embedding these principles in widely practiced consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics frameworks does not get us any closer to reducing the tensions that such research creates between promoting individual autonomy and advancing the need for society to learn how to treat and heal. these devastating diseases. What is needed is the introduction of more contemporary moral analysis. Specifically, we need to make the diversity of value perspectives of our general citizenship more inclusive. In more theoretical terms, as we rush to step ethically into this rapidly expanding field of medical research, we must elevate a societal perspective and a feminist ethic with an emphasis on relationships and context to a more central role.",0,0,
1696,Adherence to survival care plans and lifestyle recommendations among breast cancer survivors,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of survival care plans has not been widely tested. We evaluated whether one-time brief lifestyle counseling as part of a broader survival care plan was effective in changing diet and lifestyle patterns. METHODS: A diverse sample of women with stage 0-III breast cancer were randomized to control or intervention groups within 6 weeks of completing adjuvant therapy. Both groups received the National Cancer Institute's publication ""Looking Ahead: Life After Cancer Treatment."" The intervention group also met with a nurse (1 hour) and a nutritionist (1 hour) to receive personalized lifestyle recommendations based on national guidelines. Diet, lifestyle, and perceived health were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Linear regression analyzes evaluated the effects of intervention adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 126 women completed the study (60 controls/66 interventions, 61 Hispanic/65 non-Hispanic). At 3 months, the intervention group reported more information on a healthy diet (P = 0.047), the importance of physical activity (P = 0.03), and appropriate use of dietary supplements (P = 0.006), and reported a lower frequency of alcohol drinking (P = 0.03) than controls. by. At 6 months, more information on a healthy diet only (P = 0.01) was maintained. The intervention was more effective among non-Hispanics than Hispanics in improving attitudes towards healthy eating (P = 0.03) and frequency of physical activity (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The intervention changed lifestyle behaviors and knowledge in the short term, but the benefits were not permanent.

The largest of 3 randomized controlled trials from Weight Watchers reported a loss of 3.2% of baseline weight at 2 years. One randomized trial and several case series of medically supervised very low-calorie diet programs found that patients who completed treatment lost approximately 15% to 25% of their baseline weight. These programs were associated with high costs, high attrition rates, and a high probability of regaining 50% or more of the weight lost within 1-2 years. Commercial interventions and organized self-help programs available over the Internet produced minimal weight loss. Limitations: The results reported are probably the best-case scenario, as many studies did not control for high attrition rates. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of major commercial and self-help weight loss programs, with the exception of the Weight Watchers 1 trial. Controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these interventions.",0,0,
1699,Systematic Review: Elective Induction of Labor and Expectancy Management of Pregnancy,"OBJECTIVE: Labor induction and elective labor induction rates are increasing. Whether elective induction of labor improves outcomes or simply leads to greater complications and healthcare costs is widely debated in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and harms of elective labor induction and the anticipated management of pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (until February 2009), Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (until March 2009), bibliographies of included studies and previous systematic reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Experimental and observational studies of elective labor induction are reported in English. DATA DRAWING: Two authors summarized the study design""; patient characteristics; quality criteria and outcomes, including cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal morbidity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 6117 potentially relevant articles, 36 met inclusion criteria: 11 randomized, controlled studies ( RCT) and 25 observational Overall, expected management of pregnancy was associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) cesarean delivery (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.39]; absolute risk difference, 9 RCTs' than elective induction of labor). 1.9 percent points [CI, 0.2 to 3.7 percent points]. Women at or beyond 41 weeks of gestation who were administered as expected had a higher risk for cesarean delivery (OR, 1.21 [CI, 1.01 to 3.7 percent points]). 1.46)), although this difference was not statistically significant in women less than 41 completed weeks of gestation (OR, 1.73 [CI, 0.67 to 4.5]). was more likely (OR, 2.04 [CI, 1.34 to 3.09]). LIMITATIONS: Recently, there were no RCTs of elective induction of labor below 41. gestational weeks. The 2 studies conducted below 41 weeks of gestation were of poor quality and could not be generalized to current practice. CONCLUSION: RCTs suggest that elective induction of labor at and after 41 weeks of gestation is associated with a reduced risk of cesarean delivery and meconium. - stained amniotic fluid. There are concerns about the translation of these findings into actual practice; therefore, future studies should examine elective induction of labor in settings where most obstetric care is provided.",0,0,
1700,Systematic Review: Long-Term Effects of False-Positive Mammograms,"BACKGROUND: Although abnormal screening mammograms may adversely affect women's psychological well-being during the period immediately surrounding testing, their long-term effects are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the long-term effects of false positive screening mammograms on behavior DATA SOURCES: English studies to August 2006 from MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases. STUDY SELECTION: the effects of false positive results of routine screening mammography on women's behavior, health, or beliefs. DATA DRAWING: Two researchers independently coded study characteristics, quality, and effect sizes. DATA SYNTHESIS: 23 eligible studies (n = 313.967) were identified. The random effects meta-analysis showed that US women who received false positive results on screening mammography were more likely to return to routine screening than those who received normal results (hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.12]). The effect was not statistically significant among European women (hazard ratio, 0.97 [CI, 0.93 to 1.01]), and Canadian women were less likely to return to routine screening due to false-positive results (hazard ratio, 0.63 [CI, 0.50 to 1.01]). 0.80]). Women with false positive results performed breast self-exams more frequently and had higher but not pathologically elevated levels of distress and anxiety and thought more about breast cancer than with normal results. LIMITATIONS: Relational study designs, small number of studies, lack of clinical validation for many measures, and possible heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Some women with false positive results on mammography may have differences in whether they return for mammography, occurrence of breast self-exams, and anxiety levels when compared. with women with normal results. Future research should examine how false positive results on mammography affect other outcomes such as trust and healthcare use.",0,0,
1701,Systematic Review: The Value of Periodic Health Assessment,"Background: Periodic health assessment (PHE) has been a core part of medical practice for decades, although there is no consensus on its value. As MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library, review of reference lists and hand search of journals up to September 2006. Study Selection: Studies (English only) evaluating the delivery of preventive services, clinical outcomes, and costs between patients receiving PHE and patients receiving PHE. persons receiving ordinary care. Data Extraction: Study design and settings, descriptions of PHE, and clinical outcomes associated with PHE. Data Synthesis: The best available evidence evaluating the benefits or harms of PHE consisted of 21 studies published from 1973 to 2004. PHE had a consistently beneficial association with patients receiving gynecological exams and Papanicolaou smears, cholesterol screening, and stool occult blood tests. ting. PHE also had a beneficial effect on patient “anxiety” in 1 randomized, controlled trial, but had mixed effects on other clinical outcomes and costs. Limitations: The descriptions of PHE and results were heterogeneous. Some trials were conducted before the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were issued, limiting their applicability to modern practice. Conclusions: Evidence shows that PHE improves the delivery of some recommended preventive services and can reduce patient anxiety. Although additional research is needed to clarify the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of taking PHE, the evidence of benefits in this study justifies the application of PHE in clinical practice.""",0,0,
1702,Systematic reviews that examine the implementation of the research and its impact on population health are needed.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the research translation phase focus (T1-T4) of systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Briefly, T1 includes reviews of ""basic science experiments""; T2 includes reviews of human trials that led to guideline development; T3 includes reviews that examine how guidelines can be brought into policy and practice; and T4 includes reviews that describe the impact of changing health practices on population outcomes. SETTING: A cross-sectional audit of randomly selected studies from CDSR (n = 500) and DARE (n = 500) was performed. The research translation phase of studies was coded by two investigators according to general and communicable disease, non-communicable disease, and injury subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 898 reviews examined a contagious, non-infectious, or injury-related condition, of which 98% of examinations in CDSR focused on T2 and the remaining 2% on T3. 8.7 focused on T1, 2.5% on T3, and 1.3% on T4: infectious (CDSR 100%, DARE 93%), non-infectious (CDSR 98%, DARE 87%) and injury (CDSR 95%, DARE 88%) Almost all reviews were T2 focused. CONCLUSION: Few reviews exist to guide practitioners and policy makers in implementing evidence-based treatments or programs.",0,0,

1704,Systems of care for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a report from the American Heart Association's Mission: Lifeline,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines require participation in systems to rapidly diagnose and treat ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). To characterize STEMI reperfusion systems currently in practice and to identify common applications in system organization, the American Heart Association surveyed existing systems in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: A STEMI system was defined as an integrated group of separate entities focused on reperfusion therapy for STEMI within a geographic region that includes at least 1 hospital and at least 1 emergency medical facility performing percutaneous coronary intervention. Systems meeting this definition were invited to participate in a 42-question survey based on expert panel opinion and knowledge of existing systems. Data were collected through the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline website. Between April 2008 and January 2010, 381 unique systems including 899 percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals in 47 states responded to the survey, of which 255 (67%) included urban areas. The predominant sources of funding for STEMI systems were percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals (n = 320, 84%) and/or cardiology practices (n = 88, 23%). Dominant system characteristics identified by the questionnaire included: STEMI patient admission regardless of bed availability at the percutaneous coronary intervention hospital (N = 346, 97%); one-phone activation of the catheterization laboratory (N = 335, 92%); laboratory without emergency physician cardiology consultation activation (N = 318, 87%); data logging engagement (N = 311, 84%);"" and prehospital activation of the laboratory with emergency department notification without cardiology notification (N = 297, 78%). The most common barriers to system implementation were hospital (n = 139, 37%) and cardiology group competition (n = 81, 21%) and access and financing of emergency health services (n = 99, 26%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey broadly describes the organizational characteristics of collaborative efforts by hospitals and emergency health services to provide timely reperfusion in the United States. These findings serve as a benchmark for existing systems and should guide healthcare teams in the process of organizing the care of STEMI patients.",0,0,

1706,Special skills training for practitioners to improve assessment of prognostic factors for persistent and disabling back pain: four quasi-experimental single-subject studies.,"The well-known gap between behavior in guidelines and clinical practice requires effective behavior change interventions. An example illustrating this gap is physiotherapists' under-evaluation of psychosocial prognostic factors (ie yellow flags) in back pain. This study aimed to evaluate a training model by performing a specific skills training intervention for caregivers and examining changes over time in physiotherapists' assessment of prognostic factors in telephone interviews. A quasi-experimental single-subject design was used for 36 weeks, with repeated measurements at baseline, intervention, and post-intervention stages. Four physiotherapists in primary health care recorded a total of 63 interviews with patients. The specific intervention included individual goal setting, skills training, and performance feedback. The primary outcome was the number of prognostic factors evaluated (0-10). Changes were seen in all four participants. The amount of prognostic factors evaluated was between 0 and 2 at baseline and increased to 6 to 10 after intervention. Time spent assessing psychosocial factors increased and time spent discussing biomedical pain symptoms decreased. Knowledge and biopsychosocial attitudes towards back pain were consistent with guidelines when included and did not significantly change during intervention. Self-efficacy for assessment of cognitive and emotional prognostic factors increased during the study phases. The results show that a specific skills training intervention using behavior change techniques such as individual goal setting, skills training, and performance-related feedback is effective in producing changes in certain clinical behaviors in physiotherapists.",0,1,
1707,Targeted intervention programs: establishing a customized practice model to improve the treatment of allergic rhinitis in a managed care population,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an intervention program to improve health outcomes in patients with allergic rhinitis in a managed care setting. STUDY DESIGN: The Departments of Care (EOC) team at Lovelace Health Systems selected allergic rhinitis for an intervention program as it was identified as one of the top 10 reasons for visits to primary care clinics. The intervention program was based on a multidisciplinary team process designed to create a customized provider and patient education program to address inconsistencies or deficiencies in allergic rhinitis treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The EOC team searched the literature and current practices and then identified inconsistencies in diagnostic and treatment patterns. Based on this research, the team developed guidelines and a provider training program. Intervention strategies were structured around decision points in a treatment protocol. More than 500 patients were followed during the allergy season using written and telephone questionnaires, symptom diaries, and encounter data. Measurable outcomes for provider and patient behavior were determined. Patient outcomes were derived from an index of preventive behavior and administrative data reporting the use of 5 drug classes. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of providers changed their delivery model as a result of the intervention program. Patient outcomes showed a decrease in the use of rescue medications, particularly antibiotics, and an increase in preventive measures in the treatment group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The EOC model resulted in positive changes in provider and patient behavior. The multidisciplinary approach resulted in broad provider engagement.",0,0,
1708,Targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: reviewing the development of a new class of drugs from the perspective of community mental health researchers.,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia is a chronic disease associated with positive and negative symptoms and widespread deficits in neurocognitive functions. Neurocognitive deficits are considered the main pathophysiological symptoms of the disease. Neurocognitive deficits are also closely related to functional outcomes. Currently, cognitive deficits remain one of the most important unmet therapeutic needs in schizophrenia. AREAS COVERED: Neuroscientific discoveries over the past decades have enriched our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This research has identified novel molecular mechanisms and processes as promising pharmacological targets. However, despite intensive efforts to develop a new class of cognitive-enhancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia over the past 5 years, no new pharmacological agents have received the necessary regulatory approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Efficacy and safety results from selective Phase II clinical studies were reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Current guidelines for the evolving concept of neurocognition and the design and methodology of clinical trials of cognitive-enhancing drugs for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia are being critically reviewed. Future directions in the development of cognitive-enhancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia are discussed from the perspective of clinicians and researchers from community mental health settings.",0,0,
1709,Task force VI: Self-monitoring of blood pressure,"BACKGROUND: It has become increasingly common in recent years for patients to self-monitor blood pressure at home or in other non-clinical settings. This phenomenon has been fueled, in part, by the increased availability of automatic sphygmomanometers, which are now both affordable and easy to use for patients. BENEFITS OF SELF MONITORING: Self-monitoring of blood pressure can be an important aid in the management of hypertension. The technique allows patients to become more involved in their care. Self-measured blood pressure values are more likely to represent mean daily blood pressure than clinical measurement and may be better associated with target organ hypertensive involvement and cardiovascular morbidity than clinical blood pressure. Finally, blood pressure self-monitoring has the potential to reduce the costs of hypertension-related care. LIMITATIONS OF SELF MONITORING: There are several issues that prevent the more widespread use of blood pressure self-monitoring in clinical practice. Devices originally marketed for use by patients were technically advanced in the 1990s, but most have not undergone rigorous clinical validation for accuracy and reliability (for example, in terms of Medical Instrumentation Association and British Hypertension Society guidelines). It is recommended that devices used by patients to measure blood pressure at home undergo the same validation processes as those applied to ambulatory recordings. Second, while the upper limits of normal for self-monitoring blood pressure in a general population can be defined statistically (approximately 135/85 mmHg), it is not yet possible to determine normal self-monitoring blood pressure because these values are mandatory. should be linked to classic clinical cardiovascular endpoints or outcomes. Third, associations between self-monitored, clinical, and ambulatory blood pressures have been described for some populations, but their behavior by age, gender, ethnicity, and treatment status requires further study. Fourth, several different programs have been used to self-monitor patients' blood pressure in clinical research and practice. When patients self-monitor blood pressure, it will be necessary to determine the number of records required and the optimal schedule. Fifth, self-monitoring of blood pressure is certainly possible in clinical trials of antihypertensive treatments, but is typically not included in their design by either researchers or pharmaceutical sponsors. Sixth, there is data showing that self-monitoring of blood pressure reduces the overall costs associated with hypertension care on an annual basis. However, as most studies on the economic impact of blood pressure self-monitoring have been conducted in managed care settings in the USA, it is unknown whether this reduction in healthcare costs will apply to other types of practice settings. on a worldwide basis. CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring of blood pressure is currently useful as an adjunctive measure in the management of hypertensive patients and may benefit clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. However, the available data on blood pressure self-monitoring are not sufficient justification for clinicians to make primary diagnostic or therapeutic decisions and should not override blood pressure obtained through clinical measurement or outpatient monitoring.",0,0,
1710,Teaching appropriate interactions with pharmaceutical company representatives: the impact of an innovative workshop on student attitudes,"BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical company representatives (PCRs) influence physicians' prescribing habits and professional behavior. However, the skills to interact with PCRs are not taught in traditional medical school curriculum. We examined whether an innovative, mandatory workshop for third-year medical students had immediate effects on knowledge and attitudes regarding interactions with PCRs. METHODS: Questionnaires conducted before and after the workshop intervention asked third-year students (n = 75) for opinions (five-point Likert scale) on the degree of bias in PCR knowledge, the impact of PCRs on prescribing habits, the acceptability of certain gifts, and GPs alike. as well as the educational value of PCR information for students. Two faculty members and a PCR moderated the workshop, which highlighted typical doctor-PCR interactions, the use of samples and gifts, the validity and legal limits of PCR information, and related ethical issues. Roleplaying with PCR has shown appropriate and unsuitable strategies for interacting with PCRs. RESULTS: The majority of third-year students (56%, 42/75) have had more than three personal interviews with a PCR about a drug product since starting medical school. Five percent (4/75) claimed no prior personal experience with PCRs. Most students (57.3%, 43/75) were unaware of current guidelines on PCR interactions. Twenty-eight percent (21/75) of the students thought that none of the aforementioned activities/gifts (lunch access, free stethoscope, textbooks, educational CD-ROMs, sports activities) should be restricted, while 24.0% (8/75) ) said that students should be restricted from only sports activities. The perceived educational value of PCR information for both GPs and students increased from 17.7% to 43.2% (chi-square, p = .0001) and 22.1% to 40.5% (p = .0007) after workshop intervention, respectively. . Student perceptions of the bias of PCR information decreased from 84.1% to 72.9% (p = .065), but the perceived impact on prescribing increased (from 44.2% to 62.1% (p = .02)). RESULTS: Students are exposed to PCRs early in their medical education. A single workshop intervention can affect students' attitudes towards interactions with PCRs. Students were more likely to acknowledge the educational value of PCR interactions and their impact on prescribing after the workshop intervention.",0,0,

Interventions A five-stage behavior modification program: (i) four weeks of unobtrusive observation to achieve a basic handwashing rate""; (ii) five weeks of open observation (advance written advice); (iii) performance feedback; (iv) ) all observations and feedback were suspended for seven weeks;"" and (v) five weeks of unobtrusive observation to obtain a residual rate. Results 939 patient contacts were observed. Baseline handwashing rates before and after patient contact were 12.4% and 10.6%, respectively. During open observation, the respective rates increased and remained stable at 32.7% and 33.3%, but increased further (to 68.3% and 64.8%) during the performance feedback period. Residual handwashing rates inconspicuously observed seven weeks after cessation of performance feedback were 54.6% before patient contact and 54.9% after patient contact. Results Performance feedback is moderately effective in training hospital health personnel on handwashing.",0,1,
1712,Breaking down the 'complex web' of the impact of policy dialogues: lessons from a dialogue case study on health reform options for Canada,"Background The knowledge exchange literature suggests that policy dialogues aim to develop the short-, medium- and long-term capacities of individuals, organizations, and health systems to use evidence to inform policy-making. Key features of effective dialogues have been proposed, but the links between these features and the realization of enhanced capacities for evidence-based policy-making among dialogue participants and the subsequent impact on policy-making activities are not well understood. Methods In 2011, we conducted a series of qualitative case studies in Canada on health financing and financing-related issues, consisting of a series of four policy dialogues that brought together national, regional and regional stakeholders. Data sources included videos of participant perspectives captured during or immediately after each. Event and follow-up key informative talks between dialogue participants in 2015, 4 years later. The three conceptual frameworks for (i) policy dialogues and capacities for use of evidence, (ii) factors that shape policy making throughout the policy cycle, and (iii) the factors that shape the application of evidence guided the thematic analysis. We then synthesized the findings in three frameworks. Conclusions The results show that the potential benefits of policy dialogues described in the literature are developed among the participants in these dialogues. The informants explained how the features of dialogue during the agenda-setting and policy-making stages of policy-making affect their capacity to use evidence, ideas, interests and institutions, and how policy options for implementation are affected by characteristics of individuals, organizations, the external environment. and processes. Conclusions We present a conceptual framework that enhances our understanding of the potential impact of policy dialogues on the content and mechanisms of policy development, and illustrates the pathways of impact on various phases of the policy cycle, from agenda setting to formulation and implementation. The Framework highlights important factors to consider in designing and evaluating policy dialogues and supporting post-dialogue information exchange efforts.",0,0,
1713,Teleconference training detailing: diabetes education for primary care physicians,"INTRODUCTION: Formal didactic continuing medical education (CME) is relatively ineffective for changing physician behavior. Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent disease and interventions are needed to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). METHODS: A stratified cluster randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate the effects of a teleconference educational detail (TED) CME on glycemic control (hemoglobin [Hb] A1c) and family physician compliance with national diabetes guidelines. TED used sequential, small-group, case-based education using CPGs delivered by a diabetes specialist. Medical record audit data from baseline to the end of a 12-month post-intervention period were compared for the control and intervention groups. Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-one physicians provided 660 medical records. The intervention did not affect the mean Hb A1c levels, but significantly changed the distribution of patients by glycemic control category (p = .04), less in the intervention group in the inadequate control (15.8% vs. 23.9%). More patients in the intervention group received insulin (alone or with oral agents) (12.0% vs. 21.2%, p = .03), and more patients in the control group only received oral agents (82.9% vs. 82.9%, p = .3). 005) . More patients in the intervention group had body mass index (7.8% vs 1.9%, p < .02), eye examination (12.1% vs. 5.1%, p = .02), and treatment plan (43.5% vs. 23.6%). , p = .01) and used a flowchart (14.6% vs. 7.7%, p < .03). Despite general satisfaction with the teleconference format, specialist educators found the format more challenging than family physicians. CONCLUSION: Teleconferencing CME was feasible, well attended, well received by participants, and improved some key diabetes management practices and outcomes.",0,0,

DESIGN Â Pragmatic, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Â 42 common practices in three UK regions. PARTICIPANTS Between December 3, 2012 and July 23, 2013, 641 adults aged 40 to 74 years with a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of 20% or greater, no previous cardiovascular event, and at least one modifiable risk factor (systolic blood pressure) were recruited. ¢â€°Â¥140 mm Hg, body mass index â€°Â¥30, currently smoking) and access to phone, internet and e-mail. Participants were individually divided into intervention (n=325) or control (n=316) groups using automated randomization classified by site, minimized by practice and baseline risk score. INTERVENTIONS - The response is the Healthlines service (besides usual care), which consists of scripts generated by interactive software followed by regular phone calls from trained lay healthcare professionals. Counselors facilitated self-management by encouraging participants to use online resources to reduce risk factors, and sought to optimize drug use, improve adherence to treatment, and promote healthier lifestyles. The control group consisted of usual care only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Â The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who responded to treatment after 12 months, defined as maintaining or reducing their cardiovascular risk. Results were collected at six and 12 months after randomization and analyzed masked. Participants were not masked. RESULTS 50% (148/295) of participants in the intervention group responded to treatment (adjusted odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.9""; number required to treat=13), compared to 43% (124/291) in the control group; possibly a random difference (P=0.08) Intervention was associated with reductions in blood pressure (difference in mean systolic -2.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -4.7 to -0.6 mm Hg), mean diastolic -2.8 (-4.0 to -1.6 mm Hg) Hg);"" weight -1.0 kg (-1.8 to -0.3 kg) and body mass index -0.4 (-0.6 to -0.1) but not cholesterol -0.1 (-0.2 to 0.0), smoking status (adjusted odds ratio) 0.4, 0.2 to 1.0, or overall cardiovascular risk as a continuous measure (-0.4, -1.2 to 0.3) Intervention, diet, physical activity, adherence to medication and access to care, received associated with satisfaction in coordinating treatment and care. A relevant serious adverse event occurred when a participant was hospitalized with low blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS Â This evidence-based treatment The lehealth approach was associated with small clinical benefits for a small number of people at high cardiovascular risk and no overall improvement in average risk. However, the Healthlines service was associated with improvements in some risky behaviors and perceptions of access to support and care.

Women over 18 months assigned to the intervention intervention group received an average of 4 calls from preventive care managers and women assigned to clinics. control group received usual care. Follow-up data were available for 99% of women and 91% of the intervention group received at least 1 call. Measurements Medical record documents of mammography, Papanicolaou test, and colorectal cancer screening according to US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations. Results ""women with mammography increased from 0.58 to 0.68 with the intervention and decreased from 0.60 to 0.58 with usual care""; the proportion of those who had the Papanicolaou test increased from 0.71 to 0.78 with the intervention increased and did not change with usual care, and the proportion of those undergoing colorectal screening increased from 0.39 to 0.63 with intervention and from 0.39 to 0.50 with usual care. The difference in screening rates between groups was 0.12 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.19) for mammography , was 0.07 (CI, 0.01 to 0.12) for the Papanicolaou test and 0.13 (CI, 0.07 to 0.19) for colorectal screening.With the intervention, the proportion of women up-to-date for the 3 tests increased from 0.21 to 0.43. and had access to a regular source of care.Medical records may not have caught all cancer screenings.ConclusionsPhone support can improve cancer screening rates among women visiting community and migrant health centers.The intervention helps health plans, large medical groups, and increasing cancer screening rates It seems well-suited to children and other organizations trying to address inequalities in care.",0,0,
1716,"Telephone screening for depressed workers, outreach and care management, and its impact on clinical and work productivity outcomes: a randomized controlled trial.","Context Although treatment for depression in line with the guidelines is clearly effective, treatment often lags behind evidence-based recommendations. Organized depression care programs significantly improve the quality of treatment, but employer recipients have been slow to adopt these programs based on a lack of evidence of cost-effectiveness from their perspective. Purpose Evaluating the effects of a depression outreach program on workplace outcomes is of concern to employers. Design, Environment, and Participants A randomized controlled trial involving 604 employees under a managed behavioral health plan was identified as having significant depression in a 2-stage screening process. Patient treatment allocation was concealed and assessments of depression severity and work performance were blinded at 6 and 12 months. Employees with lifetime bipolar disorder, substance disorder, recent mental health specialist care, or suicidal tendencies were excluded from the study. The Intervention Telephone assistance and care management program encouraged employees to seek outpatient treatment (psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medication), monitored the continuity of treatment quality, and sought to improve treatment by advising providers. A structured telephone cognitive behavioral psychotherapy was offered to participants who did not want to undergo treatment. Main Outcome Measures Depression severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology, QIDS) and job performance (World Health Organization Health and Productivity Questionnaire [HPQ] is a validated self-report tool that assesses retention, time off work, job performance, and critical workplace events) . Results Combining data at 6- and 12-month evaluations, the intervention group had significantly lower QIDS self-report scores (relative probability of improvement, 1.4""; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0; P = .009), significantly higher job retention (relative ratios, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.3; P = .02) and significantly more hours of work (ÃŸ=2.0; P=.02;""2 weeks of work equivalent to one year's impact) between intervention more than usual care groups. Results A systematic program to identify depression and promote effective treatment significantly improves not only clinical outcomes but also workplace outcomes.

1718,Telepractice in the evaluation and treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review.,"OBJECTIVE: Studies involving the use of telepractice in service delivery to individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were reviewed to inform the practice and to identify future research areas. METHODS: Systematic searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and journals identified eight studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed and summarized in terms of (a) the characteristics of the participants, (b) the technology used, (c) the services provided through telepractice, (d) the research methodology, and (e) the results of the study. RESULTS: Telepractice has been used by university-based researchers, behavior analysts, psychiatrists, and psychologists to assist caregivers and educators in the delivery of services to 46 participants with ASD. Services offered included behavioral and diagnostic assessments, educational counseling, guidance and supervision of behavioral interventions, and coaching/education in the implementation of a comprehensive early intervention program. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that telepractice is a promising service delivery approach that warrants additional research in the treatment of individuals with ASD. Directions for practitioners and possible directions for future research are discussed.",0,0,
1719,Test ordering guidelines can change ordering patterns in an academic emergency room,"An observational, pre- and post-study was conducted at a university tertiary referral center and Emergency Medicine (EM) residence to determine the impact of an educational program designed to change test sequencing behavior in an academic Emergency Department (ED). Test sequencing standards were developed by EM faculty, RNs, and NPs based on group consensus and published data. The standards were issued to all emergency room personnel from February 1996 and were included in the evidence-based medical orientation and training program for all residents and medical students prior to the start of rotation. No restrictions were placed on the actual test order. The number of laboratory tests (total and individual) ordered per 100 patients decreased significantly after the training program for total testing, complete blood count, and liver function testing (LFT) began. In addition, decreases in individual months were statistically significant for these tests. Prothrombin time and blood culture testing did not show a significant decrease in test sequencing frequency. The chemistry test sequencing frequency showed statistically significant increases. Overall, around $50,000 was saved by reducing the test order. Test sequencing behavior can be modified by a training program and can have sustainable and significant economic implications.",0,0,

1721,"Testing the effectiveness of an innovative pack of information on practitioner-reported behaviors and beliefs: UK Chiropractors, Osteopaths and Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists Low back pain Management (COMPLETE) trial [ISRCTN77245761]","BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly problem. Interventions designed to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for LBP include printed evidence-based clinical guidelines. Three professional groups of chiropractic, osteopathy and musculoskeletal physiotherapy in the UK share common ground with their approach to managing LBP and are among those targeted by the LBP guidelines. Even so, many seem unaware of the existence of such guidelines. Also, the behavior of at least some of these practitioners differs from those recommended in this guide. Few randomized controlled trials evaluating printed information as an intervention to change practitioner behavior have used a no-intervention control. All these trials used a cluster design, and most have methodological flaws. None specifically focus on practitioner behavior towards LBP patients. Studies investigating other strategies to change practitioner behavior with LBP patients have yielded conflicting results. Although a large number of LBP guidelines have been developed around the world, there is little data on whether their dissemination actually changes practitioner behavior. Sending printed information to large numbers of practitioners is an attractive dissemination and implementation strategy, primarily because of its low unit cost. The effect size of such a strategy at the individual practitioner level is likely to be small. However, if large numbers of practitioners are targeted, this strategy can yield meaningful population-level changes. METHODS: The primary aim of this prospective, pragmatic randomized controlled trial was to test the short-term efficacy (six months following the intervention) of a directly published information pack on the UK's reported clinical behavior (primary outcome), attitudes and beliefs. chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physiotherapists. We tried to randomly allocate a pooled sample of 1,800 consenting practitioners to receive the information packet (response arm) or to receive no information obtained above during normal practice (control arm). We collected survey data at baseline and six months after intervention. Analysis of the primary outcome will evaluate for cross-arm differences in the proportions of responses to questions regarding recommendations for activity, work, and bed rest that fall into the categories previously defined by an expert consensus study as ""consistent with guideline"" and ""guideline"". -inconsistent'.",0,0,

METHOD: A consensus conference was held on 13-14 January 2005 involving academic clinicians and researchers, practitioner clinicians, administrators, consumers and families. The focus was to review, update and include the most recent data to inform and recommend specific pharmacological approaches and clinical guidance for the treatment of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Updated drug algorithms for major depression (with and without psychosis) and comorbid attention deficit disorders, with consensus. These revised algorithms also included approaches that address suicide, aggression, and irritability. Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the algorithm consist of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs, the use of which is controlled by acute clinical studies and clinical experience. Recent studies support that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in addition to fluoxetine are still promoted as first-line interventions. Emphasis is placed on the need for additional assessments, precautions and monitoring as well as continuation and maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence and expert clinical consensus support the use of selected antidepressants in the treatment of depression in youth. The use of recommended antidepressant medications requires appropriate monitoring of suicidality and possible adverse effects, and consideration of other evidence-based treatment alternatives such as cognitive behavioral therapies.",0,0,

It is the task of various guiding committees around the world to ensure consistency of clinical care, to incorporate new evidence and its synthesis into practical recommendations for clinicians. Therefore, any change in a set of guidelines can have far-reaching consequences, especially if they differ from existing guidelines. This article discusses the latest American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on blood cholesterol control to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. Compared to the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines differ significantly.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on a random sample of 50 patients with heart failure selected from each of the two outpatient practices, the general internal medicine practice and the family practice practice, at a large academic medical center. Five medical review criteria were developed from the AHCPR heart failure guideline to compare the two practices with each other and with the guidelines. An educational intervention has been developed to change physician behavior for compliance with guidelines. RESULTS: Evaluation of left ventricular function occurred in 79% of all cases. 68% of eligible patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). 30% and 12% of patients treated with enalapril and captopril, respectively, were receiving the target dose as defined in the AHCPR guidelines. None of the patients who were ineligible for treatment with ACE-Is were treated with hydralazine and nitrates. When ejection fraction was less than or equal to 40%, 81% of eligible patients were treated with ACE-Is, while 59% were treated with ACE-Is when ejection fraction was greater than 40%. Calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment of 42% of the patients. A statistical difference (P = .05) was found between the two applications for documentation of left ventricular function, the use of ACE-I in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less, and the use of calcium channel blockers and beta. blockers. CONCLUSIONS: In the practices reviewed, there was insufficient use of documentation of left ventricular function, ACE-Is in eligible patients, target doses of ACE-Is, and hydralazine and nitrate use in unsuitable patients. A higher proportion of patients receive ACE-I therapy when the ejection fraction is less than or equal to 40%. Some patients may have inappropriate use of calcium channel blockers.

1727,The altruistic medical researcher: gone and forgotten?,"With increasing economic, political, and bureaucratic participation in research, little focus is placed on the idealistic and benevolent intentions of the medical researcher. Charity is a pillar of ethical human-subject research, and altruism is a form of philanthropy that is difficult to measure. It is an interest in the welfare of others without self-interest. This article examines the dimension of altruism in medical research from philosophical, psychological, and practical perspectives. With the advent of experimental human trials in the first half of the century, the reputation and recognition of doctors greatly hampered altruistic motivation. Philosophically, altruism is at best an optional moral principle. Ethical rules are not clear. In the scientific process, altruism can only exist in ethical and properly designed research. Egoism, scientific misconduct, and conflicts of interest undermine it"";"" but altruism is also a potential solution to these problems. Research is not globally focused and has an unequal distribution. In an evolutionary model, especially in the economic environment of today's science, altruism cannot evolve due to a lack of reward and feedback. Anonymity is decreasing, selfishness is increasing. Research has become an industry, and virtuous ideals are a romantic concept. If we use altruism as an indicator, its rarity and fragility indicate the unhealthy state of research.",0,0,
1728,American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology Study of Practice Patterns of Psychopharmacologists for the Treatment of Mood Disorders,"BACKGROUND: Optimal sequential treatment decisions after initial drug unresponsiveness in major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder are not well established. While practice guidelines offer expert consensus-based treatment recommendations, little is known about the ""real world"" pharmacology decisions that practice psychopharmacologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the national affiliation of the American Society for Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) via the Internet to examine the preferred pharmacotherapy strategies and factors influencing drug choices in patients with mood disorders. RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 154/752 ASCP members (21%). After a lack of response to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in major depressive disorder, participants equally preferred switching within or between antidepressant classes. After a partial response, supplemental bupropion was the preferred intervention, followed by switching classes of antidepressants. Although moderate or significant efficacy was perceived with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine in most cases, atypical antipsychotic augmentation was only considered in line four. Responders preferred to avoid antidepressants in bipolar I patients with mixed/cycle features or previous antidepressant-related mania/hypomania. In rapid cyclers, they advocated discontinuation of the antidepressant and favored the use of atypical antipsychotics and lamotrigine. CONCLUSIONS: Participating psychopharmacologists treating adults with mood disorders report that they prescribe medications that largely reflect the evidence base, with only a few notable exceptions, taking into account the characteristics of identifiable clinical subpopulations.",0,0,

To examine the implementation of a protocol for the assessment of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in rural pediatric practice. The protocol is designed to provide an effective tool for pediatricians to learn and use the ADHD guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Methods Primary care personnel (doctors, nurses, etc.) from 2 rural pediatric practices were trained to use the ADHD assessment protocol. Medical records of 101 patients were reviewed 1 to 2 years prior to protocol implementation and for the next 2 to 3 years for 86 patients to assess compliance with AAP guidelines. In addition, 34% of the scales scored by the staff were re-scored to check the scoring accuracy. Results. Prior to the availability of AAP guidelines and implementation of the assessment protocol, no primary care provider was able to consistently collect the comprehensive information currently recommended for an ADHD assessment. Parent and/or teacher rating scales were collected for only 0% to 21% of ratings on sites. Provided brief instruction and supporting materials, medical records reflected a significant improvement in detecting clinically necessary ADHD information, and parent and teacher rating scales deliver 88% to 100% of the time. Staff demonstrated the ability to score rating scales with a high degree of accuracy. The integrity of protocol collection and management was maintained 2 to 3 years after training. Results.

Traditional economic theory provides a limited set of tools for improving behavior, as it assumes that people make decisions rationally, have the mental capacity to deal with large amounts of information and choices, and have distinctive tastes and are not open to manipulation. Behavioral economics, which mixes economics with psychology, recognizes that people often do not act rationally in an economic sense. Therefore, it offers a potentially richer set of tools for understanding and influencing behavior than that provided by traditional economic theory. It has only recently been applied to healthcare.

1733,The behavior change wheel: A new method for characterizing and designing behavior change interventions.,"Background Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practice depends on successful behavior change interventions. This requires an appropriate method to characterize interventions and link them to analysis of targeted behavior. There are numerous behavior change intervention frameworks, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This article evaluates these frameworks and develops and evaluates a new framework aimed at overcoming their limitations. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases and consultation with behavior change experts were used to define frameworks for behavior change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria: comprehensiveness, consistency, and a clear link to an inclusive behavior model. A new framework has been developed to meet these criteria. The reliability it can be applied to has been studied in two areas of behavior change: tobacco control and obesity. Results Nineteen frameworks were identified covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that could enable these interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered all intervention functions or policies, and only a minority met the criteria for consistency or linkage to a behavior model. At the heart of a proposed new framework is a 'behavior system' that includes three key conditions: ability, opportunity and motivation (we call it the 'COM-B system'). This forms the center of a 'behavior modification wheel' (BCW) around which nine intervention functions aimed at addressing shortcomings in one or more of these conditions are 'centred' around which seven policy categories that can make these interventions happen. BCW, UK Department of Health 2010 tobacco was used reliably to characterize interventions covered by the control strategy and the National Institutes of Health and Clinical Excellence's guidance to reduce obesity Results Interventions and policies to change behavior can be usefully characterized through a BCW that includes: intervention functions at the center and then policy Research is needed to determine how far BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.",0,0,

However, implementing this strategy has been problematic. We targeted large-scale implementation of an adapted strategy that encompasses both test ordering and prescribing performance. The purpose of this study was to identify and analyze the challenges of the transfer process, as we were unable to achieve large-scale implementation. METHODS: In a qualitative study, 19 district health officers, pharmacists, laboratory specialists, and general practitioners were interviewed within 6 months of the transfer period. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded independently by two authors. The codes are matched to the dimensions of the normalization process theory. RESULTS: The overall idea of the strategy was broadly supported, but generating the feedback was more complex than expected, and the need for external support after strategy delivery remained high as participants did not assume responsibility for the distribution of work and incoming resources. With this. CONCLUSION: Evidence of effectiveness, a national infrastructure for these collaborations and a generally positive attitude were not sufficient for normalization. When planning complex quality improvement strategies, thinking about managing large databases, responsibility for tasks, and allocation of resources should start as early as possible. It is not enough to simply discover the barriers and facilitators experienced in a previous attempt. While the versatile implementation strategies for changing professional behavior are attractive, their inherent complexity is also a pitfall for large-scale applications.",0,0,
1738,Clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological interventions for secondary prevention of relapse after depression: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common mental disorder in community settings and is a major cause of disability worldwide. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission, or at least adequate control of depressive symptoms,"" but even after successful treatment, the risk of relapse after remission is significant. Although the efficacy of low-intensity interventions to treat primary symptoms has been extensively evaluated, the use of these interventions as a relapse prevention strategy OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological or psychosocial interventions, as the broader definition of 'low-intensity' psychological intervention has been somewhat contested, the review was conducted in two parts: A, para-professionals, a systematic review of all evaluations of 'low-intensity' interventions performed by peers. Promoters or psychological well-being practitioners to the Improved Access to Psychological Therapies program as defined by; and B, qualified mental health professionals. A coverage review of relevant assessments of interventions involving health professionals (eg, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, cognitive behavioral therapists) with < 6 hours of contact per patient. DATA SOURCES: Developed extensive literature reviews; electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2010 (including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Unindexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library), internet resources were used to identify guidelines for the treatment of depression, and related reviews, guidelines, and included studies examined. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently scanned titles and abstracts; data were extracted independently by one reviewer and checked by another using a standardized data extraction form. Inconsistencies were resolved by consensus, with the involvement of a third reviewer as needed. Inclusion criteria, population - adults or adolescents treated for depression; intervention - Part A, low-intensity interventions, specifically unsupported psychological/psychosocial interventions or supported interventions not involving highly qualified mental health professionals, and Part B, interventions performed by qualified mental health professionals and lasting less than 6 hours per-patient communication; comparator - any including treatment, placebo, psychological or pharmacological interventions; outcomes - relapse or relapse recorded where other outcomes (eg social function, quality of life) were reported; and study design - randomized, semi-randomized, and non-randomized studies with concurrent control patients for clinical efficacy. Full economic evaluations comparing two or more treatment options and considering both costs and outcomes for cost effectiveness. No studies met main part A inclusion criteria. RESULTS: For clinical efficacy review, 17 studies (14 completed, three ongoing) reported in 27 publications met Part B inclusion criteria. These studies were clinically and methodologically diverse and reported varying degrees of efficacy for the interventions evaluated. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a collaborative care-type program was potentially relevant to part A; this study reported no difference in depression recurrence over 12 months between patients who received the intervention and those who received normal care. For the cost-effectiveness review, two studies met part B criteria. One of these was an economic assessment of the above RCT, which was potentially relevant to part A. This assessment evaluates the intervention's resources as compared to usual care; however, it was unclear how valid these estimates were for the NHS. LIMITATIONS: While any definition of ""short"" is likely to be somewhat arbitrary, a touch-inclusion threshold of 6 hours per patient was used to select short high-intensity intervention studies. Most excluded studies explicitly evaluated resource-intensive interventions, but occasional studies were excluded on the basis of only slightly more than 6 hours of contact per patient. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the clinical efficacy or cost-effectiveness of low-intensity interventions to prevent relapse or relapse of depression. A comprehensive review of short-term high-intensity therapies shows that some approaches show promise in some studies, but the findings are inconsistent. Many uncertainties remain and more primary research is needed. The scope of such research should be carefully evaluated; It is important to evaluate the broader patient pathway that takes into account the heterogeneous patient groups of interest. Future RCTs conducted in the UK primary care setting should include adult participants in recovery or recovery from depression and, where appropriate, assess the quality of the intervention and consistency of practice among practitioners.

Beginning in early HIV disease (CD4 cell count >0.50Â¡ 109/L), screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years resulted in a 2.7-month increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an increased cost-effectiveness rate of $13,000. . per life-year adjusted for quality recovered. Screening with annual anal Pap tests provided the added benefit of an incremental cost of $16,600 per recorded quality-adjusted life-year. If screening was not initiated until later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count <0.50Â¡109/L), annual Pap test screening was preferred because of more common anal disease (less cost-effectiveness). More than $25,000 saved per quality-adjusted life-year compared to no screening). Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit over annual screening. The results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of ASIL to anal SCC and the efficacy of treatment of precancerous lesions. Results Screening HIV-positive gay and bisexual men with anal Pap tests for ASIL and anal SCC offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to other accepted clinical preventive interventions.",0,0,
1740,Clinician-researcher: inevitable but manageable tension,"The ""differential position"" argues that clinical research and therapeutic medical practice are sufficiently different activities to require different ethics and principles. Instead, the ""location of similarity"" argues that clinical researchers should adhere to the same fundamental principles that govern therapeutic medicine, specifically the task of providing optimal therapeutic benefit to each patient or subject. Some proponents of the similarity view argue for this because of the overlap between the role of the attending physician and the role of the researcher in a research trial. This overlap is maximum when the same physician takes on both roles relative to a particular patient-subject. We address the ethical tensions inherent in this role conflict and argue that the tensions are real but manageable. The difference position provides a solid ethical framework for managing these tensions, while the similarity position is unsatisfactory as it tries to deny the existence of tensions.",0,0,
1741,The CLUES trial: a cluster randomized clinical trial to evaluate cardiovascular guideline practice in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Appropriate care for people with cardiovascular risk factors can reduce morbidity and mortality. One strategy to improve the care of these patients includes the application of evidence-based guidelines. To date, very little research has been published on the impact of such implementation strategies in our environment. purposes. To evaluate the efficacy of a multifaceted tailored intervention compared to usual practice in the implementation of three guidelines on cardiovascular risk (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia) in primary care in Basque Healthcare. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-year cluster randomized clinical trial in primary care in two regions in Basque Healthcare. All primary care units are randomized. Data from all patients with diabetes, hypertension, and susceptible to coronary risk screening will be analyzed. Interventions. The control group will receive standard practice. The experimental group will receive a versatile tailor-made practice strategy, including a dedicated web page and workshops for family physicians and nurses. Endpoints. Primary endpoints: annual demand for glycosylated hemoglobin, baseline laboratory tests for hypertension, cardiovascular risk screening (women 45-74 years and men 40-74 years). Secondary endpoints: other process and clinical guide indicators. ANALYSIS: Data will be extracted from central computerized medical records. ANALYSIS will be carried out at the level of a primary health care unit weighted by cluster size.

1742,Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program: a practice coaching intervention from the High Plains Research Network,"INTRODUCTION: Asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program was initiated to create a method for primary care practitioners to (1) provide coaching, education, and support for evidence-based asthma diagnosis and treatment, and (2) improve asthma care so that patients are effectively educated and activated. self-management of diseases. METHODS: Initiated a joint program involving 2 academic medical institutions and the High Plains Research Network, a primary health care-based research network in eastern Colorado. Focus groups were held with rural Colorado patients and health care clinicians to assess need and identify the most effective intervention strategies. Later, two nested training programs or ""toolkits"" were developed, one for healthcare clinicians and one for patients. Clinicians received 3 coaching sessions conducted by 2 nurses in practice, which included guide-based methods for the assessment and treatment of asthma, coaching to assist practices in the implementation of these methods, and training in communication techniques to promote asthma self-management. Applicants were also given a spirometer and trained in its use and interpretation. Patient self-management toolkits were provided to clinicians trained to use materials to educate patients and increase adherence to treatment. Assessments are based on practice interviews 1 to 3 months after coaching. RESULTS: Coaching took place in 57 of 58 primary care offices in eastern rural and semi-rural Colorado. Practices reported changes in asthma management behaviors: (1) 40.4% of practices increased use of inhaled corticosteroids, the median percentage of patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids increased from 25% to 50%”; (2) 53.2% of practices, increased use of inhaled corticosteroids. use of asthma action plans in which the median percentage of patients with an action plan increased from 0% to 20%;"" and (3) 78.7% of applications initiated or increased the use of spirometry, resulting in an increase in median usage from 0% to 30%. CONCLUSION: The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program has successfully extended asthma care education to most rural health care practices. Acceptance by practices can be attributed to the provision of flexible, in-office coaching and spirometry. Significant changes in asthma management practices are likely to reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits.",0,0,
1743,Community Physicians Network (CPN): an academic community partnership to address inequalities in healthcare,"INTRODUCTION: Inequalities in healthcare are perpetuated by three main factors: 1) patient factors including multiple risk factors and comorbidities""; 2) healthcare practitioner factors, including inconsistent application of practice guidelines due to a limited clinical trial database of effective treatments in African Americans and insufficiently other underrepresented minorities; and 3) barriers in the healthcare delivery system that result in inadequate access to care.The Morehouse Medical School Community Physicians Network (CPN) was established to address inequalities in healthcare by focusing on provider-specific strategies OBJECTIVES: 1) To identify treatment gaps between CPN practices and use disease-specific registries to facilitate quality improvement processes; 2) develop practice-specific and guideline-based educational messages to promote quality care; 3) involve and train CPN-physicians to: participation in clinical clinical protocols; and 4) develop a repository for all CPN-sponsored clinical trials involving significant numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented minorities. METHODS: Disease-specific outpatient records will have the following characteristics: 1) data structures and data items will use standard database codes and a data dictionary; 2) HIPPA compliant data abstraction and data transfer tool; 3) basic graph review to create application patterns and provide application-specific feedback; 4) annual registration update; 5) data record and repository held on secure servers of Morehouse School of Medicine; 6) record releases will only contain aggregated data without identification of contributing applications; 7) An electronic medical record platform will be promoted as the ultimate data management tool for CPN applications. Additionally, national speakers will take part in up to three continuing medical education (CME) programs each year and will support evidence-based practice guidelines. RESULTS: Eighty-five primary care and subspecialty practices are actively enrolled in CPN with a total of 385,000 annual outpatient visits. Structure of insurance status: HMO/PPO (45%); Medicare only (19%); Medicare HMO (11%); Medicare plus (8%); Medicaid (6%);"" Uninsured (11%). RESULTS: The Community Physicians Network will address specific gaps in healthcare for African-American and other minority patients by promoting quality care among its members and facilitating participation in approved clinics.

1746,Cost-Effectiveness and Population Outcomes of Extended HIV Screening and Antiretroviral Therapy in the United States,"History Although recent guidelines call for expanded routine screening for HIV, resources for antiretroviral therapy (ART) are limited and not all eligible people are currently being treated. Purpose To evaluate the effects of extended ART, HIV screening or interventions on the US HIV epidemic to reduce risk behavior. Design dynamic mathematical model and cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV transmission and disease progression. Data Sources Published literature. Target Population High-risk (injection drug users, men who have sex with men) ) and low-risk individuals aged 15 to 64 years at USTime Horizon20 years and lifetimes (costs and QALYs). Perspective Societal. InterventionsExtended HIV screening and counseling, treatment with ART, or both. Individuals adjusted life years (QALYs) and increased cost-effectiveness rates. Results Baseline Case Study Annual screening of high-risk individuals combined with one-time HIV screening of low-risk individuals can prevent 6.7% of the predicted 1.23 million new infections and 20% reduction in sexual activity after screening Assuming that it is, it could cost $22,382/QALY earned. Extending ART use to 75% of eligible individuals prevents 10.3% of infections and costs $20,300/QALY. A combination strategy prevents 17.3% of infections and costs $21,580/QALY achieved. Results Sensitivity Analysis Without reduction in sexual activity, extended screening prevents 3.7% of infections. Earlier initiation of ART when CD4>350 cells/mL prevents 20%Â¨C28% of infections. Additional efforts to halve high-risk behavior can reduce infections by 65%. Limitations Simplified model of disease progression and treatment"";"" Exclusion of acute HIV screening. Conclusions Concurrent expansion of HIV screening and treatment provides the greatest health benefit and is cost-effective. However, even substantial expansion of HIV screening and treatment programs is not enough to significantly reduce the US HIV epidemic without significant reductions in risk behavior.

Objective: To evaluate net health outcomes, costs, and cost effectiveness of various screening strategies for cervical neoplasia and cancer in HIV-infected women. Design: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective using a state transition Markov model. Values of incidence, progression, and regression of cervical neoplasia""; effectiveness of screening and treatment; progression of HIV disease; mortality from HIV infection and cancer; quality of life;"" and costs are obtained from the literature. Setting: Clinical practice simulation in the United States. Patients: HIV-infected women representing the US population. Intervention: Six main screening strategies No screening, annual Papanicolaou smear, annual Papanicolaou smear after two negatives Smears taken 6 months apart (recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), semi-annual Papanicolaou smears, annual colposcopy, and semi-annual colposcopy taken into account. Measures: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and increased cost-effectiveness. Results: Annual Papanicolaou smear scan at 2.1 months in quality-adjusted life expectancy at an incremental cost of $12800 per QALY saved. It resulted in a profit. After two negative smears taken 6 months apart, annual Papanicolaou smear screening provided an additional 0.04 QALY at a cost of $14800 per QALY saved. The semi-annual Papanicolaou smear scan provided an additional 0.17 QALY at a cost of $27,600 per QALY saved. Annual colposcopy costs more, but offers no added benefit compared to semiannual Papanicolaou smear screening, and semiannual colposcopy has cost more than $375,000 per QALY recorded. The results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of neoplasia to invasive cancer. Conclusions: In HIV-infected women, screening for cervical cancer with annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears 6 months apart offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to: other clinical preventive interventions.",0,0,
1748,Current state of health research and ethics in Sudan,"At the turn of the twentieth century, health research in Sudan developed primarily as a function of colonial British rule. Ethical issues in the medical profession in Sudan are governed by the Sudan Medical Council. To address these issues, the Sudan Medical Council published the Guidelines on Forensic Medicine and Ethics in 1967. This important document focused mainly on ethical issues arising in clinical medicine. It is very difficult to find any reference to research ethics throughout the history of health research in Sudan. However, few attempts have been made to articulate ethics in health research. In 1979, Sudan witnessed the establishment of its first ethics review committee, which was set up on the initiative of a group of doctors and scientists from the national health research laboratory. This committee was neither politically nor institutionally recognized. For this reason, it could not be developed and ended shortly after its beginning. However, in 2000 FMOH established an ethics review committee (ERC). The functions of this committee were to review health research proposals to be conducted in the country for ethical issues, regardless of funding agencies. Unfortunately, the committee devoted all work only to reviewing externally funded health research and research conducted by expatriate researchers or international organisations.",0,0,
1749,Demonstrate a theory-based approach to the design of localized patient safety interventions.,"Background There is evidence of unsafe care in healthcare systems globally. Interventions to implement the proposed practice often have modest and variable effects. Ideally, the selection and adaptation of interventions to local contexts should amplify the effects. However, the means by which this can happen are rarely systematic, theory-based, or made transparent. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility, feasibility, and acceptability of a theoretical field framework application (TDFI) approach to co-design patient safety interventions. Methods We worked with three hospitals to support the application of evidence-based guidance to reduce the risk of feeding into misplaced nasogastric feeding tubes. Informed by key principles from TDF and practice literature, our step-by-step process included ""involving stakeholders""; identifying target behaviors; identifying local factors (barriers and levers) influencing behavior change using a TDF-based survey; working with stakeholders to create specific local address key barriers Exit interviews and audit data collection were undertaken to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach Results Implementation teams for each Trust, following audit and discussion, Use of nasogastric tubes before feeding as the main targeted behavior. showed differences in key barriers between organizations.Focus groups introduced innovations to overcome barriers such as awareness activities, screensavers, equipment changes, and interactive learning resources. The worker created generalizable and adaptive strategies. rcs. Exit interviews identified themes regarding the benefits, challenges, and sustainability of this approach. Time trend control data were collected for 301 patients over an 18-month period for a Trust, suggesting clinically significantly improved use of pH following intervention and documentation of practice. Conclusions TDF is a viable and acceptable framework for guiding the implementation of patient safety interventions. The cascading TDFI approach involves healthcare professionals and facilitates contextualization in identifying target behavior, uncovering local barriers, and choosing strategies to address these barriers. This approach can be beneficial for implementation teams and policy makers, but our promising findings confirm the need for more rigorous evaluation; “A balanced block assessment is currently underway.",0,1,
1750,Design and evaluation of a graphical display for laboratory data,"Purpose Advances in health information technology have provided opportunities to present data in new and more effective ways. In this study, we designed a laboratory display with small, data-intensive graphs called sparklines, which have recently been promoted as effective representations of medical data but have not been well studied. The impact of this new display on physicians' interpretation of data was investigated. Design Twelve physicians spoke aloud as they evaluated laboratory data from four patients in a pediatric intensive care unit using a graphical display and a traditional table display. Measurements Verbalizations were coded based on the abnormal values and trends identified for each laboratory variable. The appropriateness of the interpretations of the variables in each representation was evaluated and patterns were searched among the participants. Evaluation time was also analyzed. Results Physicians completed assessments with the graphical display significantly faster (4.6 versus 4.4 minutes, p=0.042). Compared between screens, 37% of comments did not match. Graphs were more useful when visual cues in tables did not provide trend information, while slightly abnormal values were easier to identify with tables. Results Data presentation format can affect how physicians interpret laboratory data. Graphic displays have many advantages over numerical displays, but they are not always optimal. User, task and data characteristics should be taken into account when designing information screens.",0,1,
1751,Development of an intervention to promote compliance with national guidelines for suspected viral encephalitis,"OBJECTIVE: Central nervous system infections can lead to devastating clinical outcomes if not diagnosed and treated promptly. There is a documented gap between proposed and actual practice and limited understanding of its causes. We identified and explored the causes of this gap, focusing on the most relevant points of change in the patient pathway and the development of a tailored intervention strategy to improve diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Using theoretically informed semi-structured interviews, we searched for barriers and facilitators to diagnose and manage patients with suspected encephalitis, specifically performing lumbar puncture and initiating antiviral therapy within 6 hours. We deliberately sampled UK hospitals and hospital staff. Before the frame analysis, we audio-recorded and transcribed all interviews. We placed the identified barriers and facilitators on the patient path. We matched behavior change techniques targeting clinicians with the most prominent barriers and facilitators and placed them in an intervention package. RESULTS: We interviewed 43 personnel in six hospitals. Clinical staff expressed uncertainty about when and how to perform lumbar punctures and highlighted the practical difficulties of performing them in busy clinical settings. When the need for treatment was triggered, clinicians often felt they could take appropriate therapeutic action, albeit within organizational and resource constraints. Paired behavior modification techniques largely targeted treatment precursors. These included decision support for rapid recognition and practical support for lumbar punctures, emphasizing the consequences of missed diagnoses for clinicians and patients. We then designed an evidence-based package that included 'essential' interventions and 'optional' interventions to allow local flexibility. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several points in the patient pathway where practice could be improved, the most critical being clinical suspicion and initial investigation. Interventions that targeted professional beliefs and behaviors while optimizing clinical settings were among the most promising approaches to improving the treatment of suspected encephalitis.

1753,Development of evidence-based psychotherapy for use in alcoholism. a review,"The past decades have made tremendous strides in the development and validation of evidence-based approaches to psychotherapy for alcoholism. While psychoanalytic and early behavioral techniques were the original foundation of psychotherapy in this field, evidence-based approaches are now built on the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Different techniques have been developed to modify previous and ongoing conditions that favor problem behavior, eg coping/social skills training and the community empowerment approach. According to the results of the MATCH project, one of the largest treatment trials, the ""cognitive-behavioral intervention"" combines motivational enhancement therapy, the 12-step approach, and cognitive-behavioral therapy to provide new and even more effective psychotherapy. for alcohol dependent patients. These extremely promising developments are surrounded by major problems, as few of the new evidence-based treatment approaches are accepted as standard treatment in Germany, plus only a fraction of all alcohol addicts in the country find their way.

1754,The dirty dozen: 12 sources of bias with mitigation pathways in forensic neuropsychology.,"The ever-expanding role of the forensic neuropsychologist in civil litigation has rightly led to a higher level of expectation for this specialist in areas such as clinical and courtroom knowledge, objectivity, and work product utility. It is the responsibility of forensic neuropsychologists to ensure that these expectations are met. Recognizing that bias is inherent in clinical and forensic work, in high-risk situations such as forensic neuropsychological assessment, it is imperative that the evaluator be proactively conscientious in recognizing and minimizing the effects of these biases. This article highlights 12 of the many common biases that the prudent forensic neuropsychologist should always consider during evaluation, as well as providing testimony or trial testimony. Role, cognitive, and practice biases are identified and illustrated. Specific recommendations have been drawn from both the empirical literature and forensic experience on how to recognize and reduce these biases. The information contained in this article aims to provide robust and practical strategies that may be useful to forensic neuropsychological practitioners.

1755,The UK economy-wide impact of pandemic influenza: a computable general equilibrium modeling experiment.,"OBJECTIVES To estimate the potential economic impact of pandemic influenza, associated behavioral responses, school closures and vaccination on the UK. DESIGN Using published data, a computable overall equilibrium model of the UK economy was determined for the various combinations of mortality and morbidity from pandemic influenza, vaccine efficacy, school closures and prophylactic absenteeism. SETTING 2004 UK economy (the most recent available with appropriate economic data). KEY CONSEQUENTIAL MEASURES The economic impact of various scenarios including different pandemic severity, vaccination, school closure and preventive absenteeism in terms of gross domestic product, output from different economic sectors and equivalent variation. RESULTS Disease-related costs alone range from 0.5% to 1.0% of gross domestic product (£8.4bn to £16.8bn) for low-fatality scenarios, and 3.3% to high-fatality scenarios. It ranged from 4.3% (£55.5bn to £72.3bn). and even greater for an extreme epidemic. School closures increase the economic impact, especially for mild outbreaks. If widespread behavior change occurs and there is large-scale prophylactic absence from work, the economic impact will increase significantly with few health benefits. Vaccination with a pre-pandemic vaccine can save 0.13% to 2.3% of gross domestic product (£2.2 billion to £38.6 billion); a single dose of a matched vaccine can save between 0.3% and 2.3% of GDP. could save 4.3% (£5.0 billion to £72.3 billion);"" and a two-dose matched vaccine could limit the overall economic impact to around 1% of gross domestic product for all disease scenarios. CONCLUSION Balancing school closures with ""business as usual"" and maintaining an adequate stock of effective vaccines are more important factors in determining the economic impact of the influenza pandemic than the disease itself. Protective leave from work in response to fear of infection can contribute significantly to the economic impact.",0,0,

Design Comparisons of pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements. Establishing a university-affiliated community hospital in Utah. Patients Two thousand and seventy-seven consecutive patients undergoing major operations in four surgical departments between January 1, 1997 and October 31, 1997 (pre-intervention) and 2,093 consecutive patients undergoing the same procedures between January 1, 1998 and October 31, 1998 (post-intervention). Intervention A program to prevent venous thromboembolism developed from the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines and a modified study process guided by a computerized reminder system. Measurements Mortality attributable to symptomatic, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and venous thromboembolism occurring within 90 days of surgery. Results Pre-intervention and post-intervention cohorts did not differ in age, disease severity, number of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, or individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The overall prophylaxis rate increased from 89.9% before application of the computerized reminder system to 95.0% after application (p < 0.0001). The combined 90-day symptomatic DVT, PE, and mortality rate attributable to PE remained the same (pre-intervention, 1.0%; post-intervention, 1.2%; odds ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.67 to 2.20). Of the 46 venous thromboembolic complications, 40 (87%) occurred despite administration of the American College of Chest Physicians recommended measures to prevent venous thromboembolism. Conclusions Computerized reminder systems combined with modified care procedures increase the rate of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism without reducing the rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism when the baseline prophylaxis rate is high. There is a surgical patient population resistant to the prophylactic measures recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians against venous thromboembolism.

In the randomized controlled trial, experimental group encounters had significantly more (P = .000) obesity-related diagnoses (11.3%) and a significantly lower false-negative rate (24.5%) compared to the control group (1%). against 66.5%, P = .000). The study findings provide evidence that the integration of a decision support feature that automatically calculates an obesity-related diagnosis increases diagnoses and reduces missed diagnoses, suggesting that such systems have the potential to improve the quality of obesity-related care. OBESITY AND OVERWEIGHT are challenging public health challenges and are the target of public health prevention goals in the United States.1 Obesity and overweight are underrecognized conditions that cause many obese patients to fail to receive appropriate interventions.2,3 Prevention and management of obesity and overweight weight encompasses a number of complex and dynamic processes4 and the integration of relevant evidence into practice is necessary to improve obesity management.5,6 Clinical practice guidelines can serve as a tool to enable evidence-based practice”; however, few studies with nurses have been conducted and methodological issues have caused the consequences of 7 Although advanced practice nurses have the potential to play important roles in the prevention and management of obesity and overweight, research is needed to explore effective strategies that support their application and therefore the application of the guideline.8 The aim of this study is to introduce personal digital assistant The aim was to compare the proportion of obesity-related diagnoses (obesity and overweight) in documented clinical encounters using predominant clinical judgment.

They are also seen as an indicator of the quality of nursing care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer prevention care package in preventing hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in patients at risk. DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster randomized trial. SETTING: Eight tertiary referral hospitals with more than 200 beds each in three Australian states. PARTICIPANTS: 1600 patients (200/hospital) were recruited. Patients: >/=18 years old""; at risk of pressure ulcer due to limited mobility; expected to stay in hospital for >/=48 hours and who can read English. METHODS: Hospitals (clusters) were divided into groups according to their last pressure ulcer rate and within strata randomized to either a pressure ulcer prevention care package or standard care. The care package was theoretically and empirically based on patient engagement and clinical practice guidelines. It was multi-component, contained three messages for patients. participation in pressure ulcer prevention care: keep moving, look after your skin. and eat healthy Educational aids for patients Includes DVD, brochures and posters Nurses in intervention hospitals are trained to collaborate with patients in pressure ulcer prevention care Statisticians, recruiters and outcome evaluators were blind to group breakdown and interventionists to study hypotheses, both at the cluster and patient level tested. vel. The primary outcome, the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers, was measured by daily skin examination, applied at both the medical and individual participant levels. RESULTS: Four clusters were randomized to each group and 799 patients per group were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.035. After adjusting for clustering and prespecified covariates (age, pressure ulcer present at baseline, body mass index, reason for admission, place of residence, and number of comorbidities at presentation), the hazard ratio for new pressure ulcers was developed (relative pressure ulcer prevention care package versus standard care). RESULTS: Pressure ulcer prevention care package was associated with a large reduction in the risk of ulceration, although no adverse events or harms were reported. , there was a high degree of uncertainty in this estimate, and the difference was not statistically significant. Possible explanations for this non-significant finding include that the pressure ulcer prevention care package was effective but the sample size was too small to detect it.",0,0,
1760,Effect of adding Pap smear information to a mammography reminder system in an HMO: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"While Background Reminders may promote cancer screening in primary care, little is known about the potential interaction between multiple reminders. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of Pap smear plus mammogram reminders and mammogram-only reminders among 2471 women aged 40 years and older enrolled in a health care facility serving a predominantly Medicaid-eligible population. Reminders included both a mailed letter for the woman and a medical record request. Results Intervention assignment was not associated with differences in FP or internist visit rates or mammography completion during the study year. Compared with women assigned to mammogram reminder therapy alone, those assigned to the combined Pap smear plus mammogram reminder intervention were more likely to visit a gynecologist (34% versus 29%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.33, 95% CI 1.08–“1.63) and Pap smear (30% vs. 23%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.89).

1761,The effect of computer reminders on GPs' prescribing behavior: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the development and distribution of guidelines, it is difficult to control drug prescribing behavior in general practice. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of applying prescribing guidelines via the reactive computer reminder system (CRS) on drug prescribing behavior. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with incomplete block design in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about antibiotics and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescribing instructions are integrated into the computerized GP information system. MEASUREMENTS: Both performance indicators and prescription volumes were calculated as main outcome measures. In addition to individual volume measurements, total scores were generated for volume measurements per drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD, and cholesterol). RESULTS: The difference between doctors turned out to be larger and more skewed than expected. No differences were found between groups for indicators and volumes regarding recommendations advocating certain drugs. Although there was a trend towards clinically significant outcomes for prescription volumes that needed to be reduced, the overall score difference between the groups was not significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that needed to be reduced, the overall score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8-44.5) prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP versus 39.7 (95% CI: 29.7-64.1) for this control. group (p 0.2). For asthma/COPD prescriptions that needed to be reduced, the overall score for the intervention group was 1.1 prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP (95% CI: 0.6-2.6) versus the control group (p 0.1). Significant differences were found in the three specific recommendations (about quinolones for cystitis, corticosteroids for CPOD, and antibiotics for acute sore throat). CONCLUSIONS: This study turned out to be unsatisfactory due to high inter-physician variability in prescribing behavior. However, computerized reminders sometimes have a positive effect in restricting certain drugs that are no longer indicated or no longer indicated in general practice.",1,1,
1762,The Effect of Educational Intervention on Medical Diagnostic Records of Residents,"INTRODUCTION: Research shows that using interventions, including education, can improve medical record documentation and reduce missing files. As physicians play a crucial role in medical record documentation, the researchers aim to examine the impact of educational intervention on physicians' performance and knowledge of medical diagnostic record principles among residents at Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 40 residency students (in internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, anesthesiology and surgery) at Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences in 2010. During a workshop, guidelines were taught for recording diagnostic information related to a particular specialization. Five medical records were selected from each resident to evaluate the physicians' performance on chart documentation before and after the intervention. Using a questionnaire, physicians' pre- and post-intervention information was searched. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: The change in physicians' knowledge before and after education was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). The occupants' behavior did not change statistically significantly over the three phases of the study. CONCLUSION: The diversity of relevant factors contributing to documentation quality necessitates a portfolio of strategies for improving medical charts. A combination of best practice efforts, including educating physicians from the start of the internship and applying targeted strategy to problem areas and existing gaps, can improve physicians' behavior on chart documentation.",0,0,
1763,Impact of external feedback on the management of medicare inpatients with congestive heart failure,"The aim of this study was to compare the effect of 2 feedback strategies on compliance with congestive heart failure (CHF) guidelines. Thirty-two hospitals in 4 states were randomized to receive either a written feedback intervention (low-intensity intervention [LII]) or an intervention that included feedback, physician contact, and quality improvement tools (high-intensity intervention [HII]). CHF quality indicators were evaluated and quality managers were interviewed at baseline and remeasurement. There were no significant changes in quality indicators as a result of both interventions. Seventy-eight percent of quality managers indicated that hospital project implementation did not begin until shortly before re-measurement. HII quality managers perceived the CHF project as significantly more successful than LII quality managers (63% vs 13%, P < .01). Evaluating the effects of external feedback on practice behavior requires sufficient time for organizational and individual clinician change to occur. Physician contacts can play a role in facilitating this change.",0,1,
1764,The effect of mobile phone text message reminders on the compliance of Kenyan healthcare workers with malaria treatment guidelines: a randomized cluster trial.,"Background Health professionals' malaria case management practices often differ from national guidelines. We evaluated whether text message reminders to healthcare workers' mobile phones could improve adherence to treatment guidelines for outpatient pediatric malaria in Kenya. Methods From March 6, 2009 to May 31, 2010, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 107 rural health facilities in 11 counties in coastal and western Kenya. In a computer-generated sequence, healthcare facilities were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, where all healthcare professionals received text messages to their personal mobile phones in malaria case management for 6 months, or the healthcare worker control group. do not receive any text messages. Although patients were unaware of whether they were at the response or control facility, healthcare workers were not masked to the response. The primary outcome was correct management with artemether-lumefantrine, defined as a dual composite indicator of therapeutic, dispensing and counseling tasks in line with Kenyan national guidelines. The primary analysis was with intent to treat. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN72328636. Findings 119 healthcare workers received interventions. Case management practices were evaluated for 2269 children in need of treatment (1157 in the intervention group and 1112 in the control group). Therapeutic analysis showed that correct artemether-lumefantrine administration improved by 23Â·7 percentage points (95% CI 7Â·6–40Â·0""; p=0Â·004) and 24Â·5 percent immediately after intervention. 1â€“41Â·0;"" p=0Â·003) 6 months later.

1766,Effect of registry-based performance feedback via short text messages and traditional mail letters on parenteral steroid prescribing by general practitioners - A randomized controlled trial,"Background Providing feedback on physicians' prescribing behavior is predicted to improve the quality of drug prescriptions. However, the effectiveness of providing feedback and the way it provides feedback is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the impact of traditional paper letters (TPL) and short text message (STM) feedback on the behavior of general practitioners prescribing parenteral steroids (PSs). Methods In a single-blind, randomized controlled trial, 906 general practitioners (GPs) with at least 10 months of prescription were randomly assigned to two interventions and a control study arm, stratified by percentage of prescription, in a 1:1 allocation. The intervention was to provide 3 feedback messages containing prescribing indices in the TPL and STM (first two arms) against the control arm (CG) with a 3-month interval between these messages. We calculated the PS Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for each GP each month and compared between the 3 arms before and after interventions. The primary expected outcome was a reduction in parenteral steroid prescription by participants. The study was conducted at the Kirman Social Security Institution in Iran. Results A total of 906 GPs were selected for the trial, but only 721 (TPL = 191, STM = 228, CG = 302) were recruited for 1st feedback. The average age of general practitioners is 44 and 59% of them are male. The parenteral steroid DDDs prescribed at baseline were similar (TPL = 121.62, STM = 127.49, CG = 115.68, P > 0.5). At the end of the study, DDDs in the TPL and STM arms were similar (TPL = 104.38, STM = 101.90, P > 0.9), but DDDs in each intervention arm were statistically significantly lower than CG (CG = 156.17, P < 0.0001). Being in the TPL and STM arms resulted in a reduction of 36.1 and 41.7 units in DDD compared to the control arm (P < 0.02 and P < 0.005) after one year of the study, respectively. Conclusion Feedback on prescribing performance of TPLs and STMs effectively reduced GPs' prescribing PS. An inexpensive and fast tool, STM is potentially powerful and effective for rationalizing drug prescription.",1,1,

1769,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of lay counselor-provided psychological treatments for harmful and addictive drinking and moderate to severe depression in primary care in India: PREMIUM study protocol for randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVE: The leading mental health causes of the global burden of disease are depression in women and alcohol use disorders in men. The main obstacle to the implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments in primary care in developing countries is the lack of qualified human resources. The purpose of these trials is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two psychological treatments developed for the treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders in primary care in India. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for parallel group, randomized controlled trials (Healthy Activity Program for moderate to severe depression, Counseling for Alcohol Problems for harmful and dependent drinking) in eight primary care centers in Goa, India. Adult primary care participants will be screened by the Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and, in males only, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for alcohol problems. Screen positive participants will be invited to participate""; men who screen positive for both disorders will be invited to participate in the Counseling for Alcohol Problems study. Those who approve will be allocated a 1:1 ratio to receive relevant psychological treatment plus enhanced usual care or primary care only Ordinary care developed by the center and using a computer-generated allocation sequence for depression classified by gender Advanced ordinary care involves the provision of contextualized World Health Organization guidelines and screening results to primary care center physicians for treatments, for a period of up to three months, to the layman. will be given by counselors.Primary outcomes are the severity and remission rates of the disorder at three months after enrollment, and for the Counseling for Alcohol Problems trial, the effect of drinking and drinking on daily life.Secondary outcomes are the severity of the disorder and remission rates at 12 months.

1770,"The effectiveness of a published information pack on the beliefs and behavior of musculoskeletal practitioners: UK Chiropractors, Osteopaths and Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists Low Back Pain Management (COMPLETE) randomized trial","STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of a printed information package on the beliefs and reported behaviors of musculoskeletal practitioners (chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physiotherapists) across the UK regarding low back pain (LBP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A significant proportion of UK musculoskeletal practitioners do not follow current LBP guideline recommendations. METHODS: A total of 1758 practitioners were randomly assigned to one of the 2 study arms. One arm was sent a printed information pack (n = 876) containing guidelines recommendations for the management of LBP, and the other arm received no intervention (n = 882). The primary outcome measure consisted of 3 ""quality indicators"" (activity, work, and bed rest) related to the sketches of a patient with LBP; here the responses were split into ""guide-inconsistent"" or ""guide-consistent"". The secondary outcome was practitioners' beliefs about LBP, as measured using the Healthcare Providers Pain and Disability Association Scale. Results were measured at baseline and at 6 months. RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up was 89%. Changes in behavior reported in the quality indicators were as follows: activity, odds ratio (OR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.61) and number to treat (NNT), 19 (15-28)""; work , OR 1.35 (1.07) -1.70) and NNT 19 (14-29) and bed rest, OR 1.31 (0.97-1.76) and NNT 47 (33-103) Consistent behavior in at least 1 of the composite NNT - 3 quality indicators for transition from guideline inconsistent to guideline 10 ( 9-14) Beliefs about LBP were significantly improved in those sent information packets (P = 0.002), but only to a small extent (mean difference), scale score of 0.884;"" 95% confidence interval, 0.319-1.448).

1771,"The effectiveness of an intervention in increasing the provision of preventive care by community health clinicians: a study protocol of a nonrandomized, multi-base trial.","BACKGROUND: The primary behavioral risks for the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in developed countries are tobacco use, malnutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Evidence, guidelines and policies support the delivery of routine clinician care to prevent these risks in primary care settings. Despite the potential provided by community health services to provide this type of preventive care, the limited evidence available indicates that it is provided at suboptimal levels. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a very strategic practice change intervention in increasing the clinician's provision of routine preventive care through a community health service network. METHODS/DESIGN: A multiple baseline study will be conducted covering all 56 community health institutions in a single health region in New South Wales, Australia. The facilities will be allocated to one of three administratively defined groups. A 12-month practice change intervention will be implemented at all facilities in each group to facilitate clinician risk assessment of eligible patients and clinicians providing brief advice and referrals to those identified as 'at risk'. The response will be implemented in a non-random order among the three facility groups. Repeated, cross-sectional measurement of the provision of preventive care by the clinician for the four distinct risks (smoking, malnutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity) will be made continuously for all three facility groups over 54 months via telephone calls. Interviews will be conducted with randomly selected clients who have visited a community health facility in the past two weeks. Data collection will begin 12 months before the intervention was administered in the first group and will continue for six months following the completion of the intervention in the last group. As a secondary data source, pre- and post-intervention telephone interviews will be conducted with randomly selected samples of clinicians from each facility group to assess reported preventive care delivery and the acceptability of practice change intervention and implementation. CONCLUSION: The study will provide new evidence of the clinician's ability to increase the delivery of routine preventive care through a network of community health facilities.

1772,Effectiveness of computer reminders to improve quality assessment for point-of-care testing in general practice - A randomized controlled trial,"Background Computer reminders are increasingly applied in efforts to improve quality and patient safety. However, research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of different types of reminders in various settings. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of computer reminders to improve adherence to a quality assessment plan for point-of-care testing in general practice. Method The study was conducted as a randomized controlled crossover trial between general practices in the Danish Capital Region. The intervention consisted of sending computer reminders (ComRem) to applications that did not follow the guideline recommendations of the split test for hemoglobin and glucose. The applications were randomly divided into two groups. During the first follow-up period, one group received the ComRem intervention along with general practice activities (GIA), while the other group received GIA only. For the second follow-up period, the intervention was alternated between the two groups. Results were measured as adherence to the split test procedure. Results A total of 142 treatments were randomly assigned to the early intervention group and 144 treatments to the late intervention group (control group in the first follow-up period). During the first intervention period, the average number of split tests performed in the group receiving the ComRem group increased from 1.22 to 3.76 (out of eight possible tests), while the average number of split tests increased from 1.11 to 2.35 in the group targeted by the GIA alone. . (p = 0.0059). A similar mnemonic effect was observed after crossover. Also, improvements in outcome measures over time have demonstrated a strong impact of computer reminders beyond intervention periods. Conclusion Computer reminders had a significant impact on adherence to the quality assessment plan for point-of-care testing. Therefore, computer reminders seem useful to support the implementation of relatively simple procedures for quality and security.",1,1,
1773,The effectiveness of computerized clinical guidelines in care: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed aimed at improving the quality of care. The implementation of computerized clinical guidelines (CCG) has been supported by the development of computerized clinical decision support systems. This systematic review evaluates the impact of CCG on the course of care compared to non-computerized clinical guidelines. METHODS: Specific properties of CCG were studied through an extensive scientific literature search and querying electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between the properties of CCG and its positive effect on the care process. RESULTS: Forty-five articles were selected. The logistic model showed automatic recommendation provision in the electronic version as part of the clinician workflow (Odds Ratio [OR]= 17.5""; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-193.7) and Year of Publication (OR = 6.7;"" 95%). . CI: 1.3-34.3) were statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSION: From the research we can conclude that significant improvements have been shown in the care process after the application of CCG. Our findings also suggest to clinicians, administrators and other healthcare decision makers what features of CCG could improve the structure of the computerized system.",0,1,
1774,The effectiveness of interventions to improve laboratory demand patterns among primary care physicians: a systematic review.,"Background Laboratory testing is an integral part of daily primary care practice, with approximately 30% of patient encounters resulting in a request. However, research shows that the majority of cravings do not benefit patient care and are preventable. The purpose of this systematic review was to comprehensively search the literature for studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve primary care physician use of laboratory tests. Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus (baseline to 09/02/14) search were conducted. The following study designs were considered: systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), pre- and post-study controlled (CBAs), and interrupted time series analysis (ITSs). The quality of the studies was assessed using a modified version of the Organization for Effective Practice and Care (EPOC) checklist. The population of interest was primary care physicians. Interventions were considered if they were intended to improve laboratory testing in primary care. The result of interest was a series of laboratory tests. Results A total of 6,166 titles and abstracts were reviewed, followed by 87 full texts. Of these, 11 articles were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. This includes four RCTs, six CBAs and one ITS study. The types of interventions reviewed included education, feedback, instructions, training with feedback, feedback with instructions, and changing order forms. The quality of the included studies varied, with seven studies deemed to have a low risk of bias, three considered to have an uncertain risk of bias, and one considered to have a high risk of bias. All but one study found significant reductions in the volume of tests following intervention, with effect sizes ranging from 1.2% to 60%. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity. Conclusions Interventions such as training strategies, feedback, and changing test sequence forms can improve the efficient use of laboratory tests in primary care"", but the level of evidence is very low and of low quality. The reproducibility of findings from different laboratories is also difficult to establish from the literature. To enable formal meta-analysis Some standardization of both interventions and outcome measures is required.",0,1,

DESIGN Multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial. IDENTIFICATION 24 primary health care facilities (youth clinics, general practices and school-based counseling services) in New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS 187 adolescents aged 12-19 years seeking help for depressive symptoms, without significant risk of self-harm, and considered in need of treatment by primary care professionals: 94 allocated to SPARX and 93 to usual treatment was done. INTERVENTIONS Computed cognitive behavioral therapy (SPARX) consists of seven modules delivered over a period of four to seven weeks, with treatment consisting of face-to-face counseling, as usual, delivered by trained counselors and clinical psychologists. RESULTS The primary outcome was the change in the revised score of the children's depression rating scale. Secondary outcomes included the revised response and remission of the children's depression rating scale, the Reynolds adolescent depression scale-second edition change scores, the mood and emotions questionnaire, the Kazdin hopelessness scale for children, the Spence children's anxiety scale, the children's pediatric quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire, and treatment ratings. overall satisfaction. RESULTS 94 participants were assigned to SPARX (mean age 15.6 years, 62.8% women) and 93 participants were assigned to treatment as usual (mean age 15.6 years, 68.8% women). 170 adolescents (91%, SPARX n = 85, treatment-as-usual n = 85) were evaluated after intervention, and 168 (90%, SPARX n = 83, treatment-as-usual n = 85) were evaluated at the three-month follow-up point. Per-protocol analyzes (n = 143) showed that SPARX was not inferior to treatment as usual. After intervention, children's depression rating scale revised raw scores had a mean reduction of 10.32 on SPARX and 7.59 on treatment as usual (group difference 2.73, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 5.77""; P=0.079) Remission rates in the SPARX arm (n = 31, 43.7%) were significantly higher than in the normal treatment arm (n = 19, 26.4%) (difference 17.3%, 95% confidence interval 1.6% to 31.8%; P = 0.030) and response rates were significantly higher in the SPARX arm ( There was no significant difference between 66.2%, n = 47) and usual treatment (58.3%, n = 42) (difference 7.9%, -7.9% to 24%; “P = 0.332). ).

1776,Effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in adults: a systematic review protocol.,"OBJECTIVE: A physically active lifestyle plays a preventive role in the development of various chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Unfortunately, very few adults engage in minimal physical activity and spend excessive time sitting. Developing targeted interventions to increase active living among adults is an important public health effort. A reasonable context for reaching adults is the workplace. This systematic review aims to review the effectiveness of workplace interventions on increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in the workplace. METHODS: An advisory group will work collaboratively with the research team to inform systematic review and information mobilization. Fifteen electronic databases will be searched to identify studies examining the effectiveness of workplace interventions on physical activity and sedentary behavior. All experimental designs and observational studies (non-experimental intervention studies) meeting the study criteria will be included. Studies examining generally healthy, working, adult participants will be included in the review. Interventions will focus on increasing physical activity and/or reducing sedentary behavior from the individual to the policy level. Primary outcome variables, physical activity and/or sedentary behavior in the workplace will be reported or observed. Secondary outcomes will include variables ranging from return on investment to quality of life. Study quality will be assessed for risk of bias following the protocol described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and supplemented by guidelines developed by the Cochrane Organization for Effective Practice and Care group using RevMan. The quality of the evidence will be assessed using the Rating of Recommendations, Evaluation, Development and Evaluation approach. Studies using similar intervention strategies will use meta-analyses, forest plots and harvest plots where appropriate to assess the direction, extent and consistency of intervention impact. Follow-up knowledge mobilization activities and products will be developed to support the practical use of this knowledge. DISCUSSION: This protocol document describes a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of various types of interventions in the workplace on increasing physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior in the workplace. Collaborating with an advisory group of potential information users throughout the process presupposes greater use and access by information users of the information gained from this systematic review.

1777,Effects of a postgraduate course on opioid prescribing patterns of general practitioners,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a single palliative cancer care workshop with information on drug prescribing has an impact on GPs' opioid prescribing patterns in daily practice. METHOD: The opioid prescription figures of 68 general practitioners participating in the workshop were collected from the computer system of the Regional Disease Fund. Prescription numbers one year before and one year after the workshop were compared and a control group that did not participate in the study was included. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the limited effectiveness of a palliative cancer care workshop on the morphine prescription figures of general practitioners in daily practice. This limited effect was not in line with the results of a pre- and post-workshop survey evaluating the attitudes of the same practitioners. CONCLUSION: A single workshop cannot make significant changes in prescription behavior. Possibilities for further reinforcement are discussed.,0,0,

Most of the positive studies have been done in the United Kingdom, where incentives are greater than in the United States. The greatest improvements were seen in areas where fundamental performance was weak. There was insufficient evidence to characterize a consistent effect of P4P on intermediate health outcomes (low-powered evidence) and any effect on patient health outcomes. In the hospital setting, there was low-power evidence that P4P had little or no effect on patient health outcomes and a positive effect in reducing hospital readmissions.

1782,The effects of price information on physicians' test ordering behavior: ordering diagnostic tests.,"This research evaluated the effects of providing physicians with information about the prices of diagnostic tests on their subsequent test ordering behavior. The study population consisted of 36 second- and third-year residents and 23 clinical faculty members at three family medicine centers affiliated with the Wayne State University School of Medicine Department of Family Medicine in Detroit, Michigan. Study participants were asked to review four case studies, each describing a patient with unclear symptoms, and specify the tests they would order for each patient in an accompanying test instruction. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that received test order forms (price-information group) with prices for diagnostic tests printed, or a group that received test order forms with no prices (control group). Study results show that for each of the four cases, the average number of diagnostic tests ordered was significantly lower in the price-information group than in the control group. Our findings also show an average reduction of 31.1 percent in the cumulative cost of tests ordered per patient in relation to providing price information. The feasibility of regularly providing price information to physicians is discussed and reviewed in light of other approaches developed to change physician behavior when diagnostic tests are requested.",1,1,
1783,The effectiveness of an automated feedback system for GPs,"OBJECTIVE: An automated feedback system has been developed that generates comments about general practitioners' (GPs) non-compliance with accepted practice guidelines for ordering diagnostic tests. Before implementing the automated feedback system in daily practice, we evaluated the potential impact of the system on GPs' test ordering behavior. DESIGN: We used a randomized controlled trial with a balanced block design. SETTING: A group of six participating GPs five times in a computer lab setting. INTERVENTION: Family physicians reviewed a random sample of 30 request forms they had filled earlier that year. If they deem necessary, they can make changes in the requested tests. Next, the system displayed critical comments for their non-compliance with the guidelines, as evidenced by the (updated) claim forms. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four randomly selected practitioners participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of diagnostic tests requested (17% [CI]: 12-22% with 95% confidence interval) and proportion of tests ordered that did not comply with practice guidelines (39% with 95% CI: 28-51%), automatic reversal decreased due to the comments of the notification system. Physicians accepted 362 (50%) of 729 reminders. APPLICATIONS: Although our experiment cannot predict the extent of the actual effect of the automatic feedback system in daily practice, the observed effect can be seen as the maximum achievable effect.",1,1,
1784,The effectiveness of computer reminders on external quality assessment for point-of-care testing in Danish general practice: rationale and methodology of two randomized trials.,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing (POCT) is increasingly used in general practice to assist general practitioners (GPs) in the management of patients with diseases. However, low adherence to quality guidelines for split testing procedures has been observed among GPs in parts of the Danish Capital Region. Computer reminders embedded in GPs' electronic medical records (ComRem) may facilitate improved quality control behavior, but more research is needed to determine what types of reminders work and when. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ComRem in improving GPs adherence to quality guidelines. In this article, the rationale and methods of the study constituting this research project are explained. METHODS/DESIGN: The study was conducted as two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between general practices in two regions of the Danish Capital Region. These districts contain a total of 739 GPs in 567 practices and a total of 1.1 million patients allocated to practice lists. In the first RCT (RCT A), ComRem is compared to mail reminder letters. In the second RCT (RCT B), ComRem is compared to usual events (without reminders) using the crossover approach. In both of these studies, results are measured by the number of split tests taken by the laboratory. CONCLUSION: This study will contribute to information about the effectiveness of ComRem in primary care. As the study did not explore GPs' perceptions and experiences with ComRem, we will then conduct a qualitative survey focusing on these aspects.

1785,Effectiveness of visual cues to improve hand hygiene compliance,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines governing HCW hand hygiene (HH) behavior are well-structured. Despite the known dangers of healthcare-associated infection for both healthcare workers and patients, hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates remain extremely low. To evaluate a possible solution to this ongoing challenge, we used a simulated patient encounter in a real hospital room to test the effectiveness of individual HH triggers. METHODS: One hundred and fifty healthcare workers (75 doctors and 75 nurses) participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of five equally sized groups. Each participant performed a focused physical examination on a standardized patient and was expected to maintain HH before and after the examination. Various cues were used using two rooms in a medical-surgical unit in a tertiary teaching hospital and the effect on HHC was recorded before and after the examination. In the control group, the hand sanitizer box was in its normal position (Baseline). In one group, the dispenser was moved directly to the line of sight (Line of Sight) as it entered the room; in the other, flashing lights were attached to the dispenser in its usual position (Base Line and Flicker); and in a third group, the dispenser was placed in line of sight and flashing lights were installed (Line-Line). of-Sight & Flicker) In the last group, a large warning sign (Warning Sign) was affixed to the door, informing the healthcare facility that the room was under electronic surveillance and that failure to perform the HHC would trigger an alarm. analyzed using a model, P<0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the control group (Base), the pre- and post-exam HHC rates were 36.7% and 33.3%, respectively. All interventions improved HHC pre-intervention compared to baseline (Line of View=% 53.3, Initial & Vibration=60%, Line of Sight & Shiver=66%, Warning Sign=93.3), but only Sight & Flicker and Warning Sign produced a statistically significant increase in pre-exam HHC (P=0.022 and P<0.001, respectively). Only the Warning Sign produced a statistically significant increase in HHC post-exam (P<0.001). RESULTS: Visual cues can improve HHC, but their effectiveness varies. A warning sign informing a surveillance system and subsequent non-compliance reporting resulted in the most significant improvement in HHC. Using a standardized patient in a real hospital room was a helpful tool in evaluating HHC and the impact of various interventions designed to improve patient safety.",1,1,
1786,Employment of ward opinion leaders for continuing education in the hospital.,"Opinion leaders (OLs) are members within a social group who have significant social influence over others. A guideline for urinary catheter care was created in three groups (A, B, and C) of two randomly assigned wards. Two OLs per ward by nurses in groups A and B were determined using a sociomem'c method. For training, in-service lectures for 30% of nurses in group A and OL tutorials for all nurses were used; The training of OLs in B, lectures in C, and ward nurses were in turn responsible for the training of newly arrived student nurses. After the training program, the frequency of application of the guide was evaluated by applying a questionnaire to 30% of randomly selected nurses and making direct observations for misapplications. In addition, a knowledge contest was held for one student about the guide. The best results for all three measurement methods were group A, followed by B and C. ;"" and differences were significant for the three groups (p<.05). This indicates that continuing education in the hospital can be conducted effectively with enrollment of ward OLs.",1,1,
1787,Increasing epidemics of obesity and sedentary lifestyle. A call to action for clinicians,"Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are escalating national and global epidemics that require greater attention from doctors and other health professionals. These intricately linked conditions are responsible for an enormous burden of chronic disease, impaired physical function and quality of life, at least 300,000 premature deaths, and direct health care costs of at least $90 billion per year in the United States alone. Clinicians are at the forefront of the battle, but little attention is paid to these conditions during a typical office visit. Clinicians often feel overwhelmed by these challenges and point to a lack of clear guidelines and means of implementation, minimal training in behavior modification strategies, and a lack of time to not confront them. This report provides a ""call to action"" with step-by-step directions specifically for the important role of doctors and other healthcare professionals in preventing these dangerous outbreaks. Requiring only a few minutes of a clinician's time to implement, this action plan will facilitate more effective intervention on obesity and inactivity and positively impact public health.",0,0,
1788,Esperance primary suicide prevention project,"BACKGROUND: Suicide has been a major community concern in Esperance, a geographically isolated port on Western Australia's south coast. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of three evidence-based interventions for the primary prevention of suicide: (i) provide suicidality awareness sessions for staff in health, education, and social services""; (ii) limit the sale of over-the-counter analgesics (aspirin and paracetamol) to packages containing less than the minimum lethal dose. ;"" and (iii) the application of Commonwealth media guidelines for media reporting of suicides. METHODS: Changes in knowledge, awareness, attitude, comfort, and use before and after each intervention were assessed using standard tools and proforma from previous studies, such as the Youth Suicide Prevention Training Manual and the Suicide Intervention Beliefs Scale. Percentage changes in the number of retail outlets selling over-the-counter analgesics for less than potentially lethal amounts (less than 8 g of paracetamol or aspirin) were also measured. Media representatives were interviewed to gain their perception of the Commonwealth Guidelines on suicide reporting and were encouraged to consult with the project team before reporting problems with suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline survey showed that mental health staff and GPs were more aware of and more willing to raise the issue with a person at risk than staff in other services about the problems of suicide, risk factors for suicide, and professional and ethical responses. . Thirty-three subjects participated in the suicide awareness training, and 21 (66%) of them answered the questionnaire. There were significant increases in awareness of suicide-related problems and risk factors, as well as professional and ethical responses when assisting a person at risk, and reported levels of knowledge regarding comfort, competence, and confidence levels. Only three media representatives were aware of the Commonwealth Health Department's Guidelines for reporting suicide, and only one believed the guidelines had affected their reporting. Local newspapers then contacted the researchers to check whether their news complied with the guidelines. Regarding access to analgesics, one in seven retailers agreed to implement the strategy (awaiting agreement from other retailers), another claimed increased awareness of the danger of analgesics, and three claimed they would seek to monitor excessive quantities sold to an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Local initiatives can increase staff awareness and knowledge in assessing suicide risk as well as local media. These need to be complemented by State or Commonwealth level initiatives to change statewide media coverage or sell over-the-counter analgesics.",0,0,
1789,Ethical evaluation of innovative treatments: liver transplantation using living donors,"Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for many forms of liver disease. Unfortunately, the scarcity of cadaver donor livers limits the usability of this technique. To increase the availability of liver transplantation, surgeons have developed the ability to remove a portion of the liver from a living donor and transplant it into a recipient. Several liver transplants have been performed worldwide using living donors. Our aim was to analyze the ethics of liver transplantation using living donors and propose guidelines for the procedure before it is implemented in the United States. We used a ""research ethics consultation"" process that included a collaboration between clinical researchers and clinical ethicists. We concluded that liver transplantation using living donors in a small series of patients on a trial basis was ethically appropriate and published our ethical guidelines in a medical journal prior to the procedure. We propose this forward-looking, public approach to the promotion of other innovative treatments in medicine and surgery.",0,0,

1791,European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on suicide treatment and prevention,"UNLABELED: Suicide is a major public health problem in the WHO European Region, causing more than 150,000 deaths per year. Suicidal crisis: Immediate intervention must be initiated for the patient's survival. DIAGNOSIS: Up to 90% of people who complete suicide have an underlying psychiatric disorder. It has high comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders. Adequate diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment for the underlying disorder are essential to ensure successful suicide prevention. TREATMENT: Available evidence supports the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in preventing suicidal behavior. Some other psychological treatments are promising, but supporting evidence is currently inconclusive. Studies show that antidepressant treatment reduces the risk of suicide in depressed patients. However, the risk of suicidal behavior in depressed patients treated with antidepressants exists during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Anxiolytics and hypnotics and short-term additional medications are recommended in case of anxiety and insomnia. Treatment with antidepressants for children and adolescents should only be given under the supervision of a specialist. Long-term lithium treatment has been shown to be effective in preventing both suicide and suicide attempt in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. TREATMENT with clozapine is effective in reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics are promising but more evidence is needed. TREATMENT team: Multidisciplinary treatment teams consisting of psychiatrists and psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists are always preferred, as integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended, especially in patients with chronic suicidality. Family: The person who will commit suicide should always be motivated to include their family in treatment, regardless of age. Social support: Psychosocial treatment and support is recommended as the majority of suicide patients have problems with relationships, work, school and lack functioning social networks. SAFETY: A safe home, public and hospital environment without access to suicide tools is a necessary strategy for suicide prevention. Each treatment option, medication prescription, and patient discharge from hospital must be carefully weighed against the associated risks. Staff training: General practitioners' (GP) training is effective in suicide prevention. It improves the treatment of depression and anxiety, the quality of care provided, and attitudes towards suicide. Continuing education, including discussions on ethical and legal issues, is required for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.",0,0,
1792,Evaluation of a specific intervention to improve the treatment of suspected viral encephalitis: protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial.,"Background Viral encephalitis is a devastating condition in which delayed treatment is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical audits show significant scope for improved detection and treatment. Improvement strategies should ideally be tailored to identified needs and barriers to change. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a tailored intervention to improve second-line treatment of suspected encephalitis. Methods/Design The study was a two-arm, randomized controlled trial allocated by the postgraduate dean's office. Participants were recruited from 24 hospitals in 12 postgraduate deanships in the United Kingdom (UK). We have developed a multifaceted intervention package that includes basic and flexible components with established behavior change techniques selected on the basis of identified needs and barriers to change. The primary outcome would be a composite of the proportion of patients with suspected encephalitis who received a timely and appropriate diagnostic lumbar puncture within 12 hours of hospitalization and acyclovir therapy within 6 hours. We will collect pre-intervention and post-intervention outcome data for up to 12 months from patient records. Statistical analysis at the cluster level will be blind to allocation. An economic assessment will estimate intervention cost-effectiveness from a healthcare perspective.",0,0,
1793,The evolution of current medical and popular attitudes towards ultraviolet light exposure: part 3,"In the 1930s, attitudes towards ultraviolet (UV) light exposure in the medical profession began to change dramatically. UV radiation has been healthily promoted since the turn of the century, and especially after its role in vitamin-D metabolism was discovered. Increasingly, however, the focus will be on the risks of UV light exposure from sunlamps and sunbathing. During this time, the American Medical Association established guidelines for the approval of UV lamps and appropriate therapeutic uses of phototherapy. Findlay and other researchers' landmark experiments in which malignant skin tumors were induced in rodents after exposure to UV lamps or sunlight will lead to widespread recognition of the carcinogenicity of UV radiation. The role of sunlight in the etiology of skin cancer was increasingly mentioned in articles in popular journals in the 1940s and 1950s. There has also been rapid growth in the sunscreen industry, although product efficacy has been highly variable. In the 1950s, interest grew in the use of 8-methoxypsoralen (""sun pill"") and dihydroxyacetone (""sun in a bottle""). Despite the known risks of UV exposure and attempts by doctors and other health professionals to educate the public and change behavior, tanning has remained stubbornly popular. Today, exposure to excessive UV light is considered the main cause of approximately 1.3 million cases of skin cancer each year in the United States.",0,0,

1795,"Expert consensus guide series. Optimizing the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: methods, comment and summary","OBJECTIVES: There is an increasing number of atypical antipsychotics available for clinicians to choose from for the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important questions regarding drug selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and management of inadequate response, compliance issues, and relapse have not been adequately addressed in clinical trials. To aid clinical decision making, a consensus survey of expert opinions on the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders was conducted to address questions that are not conclusively answered in the research literature. METHOD: Based on the literature review, a written questionnaire with 60 questions and 994 options was developed. About half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale to rate the relevance of medical decisions. For other options, experts were asked to write down responses (eg, average doses) or tick a box to indicate their preferred response. The questionnaire was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 of whom (94%) completed the questionnaire. In the analysis of responses to items scored on a 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a nonrandom distribution of scores by the chi-square ""goodness of fit"" test. We assigned each option a categorical rank (first rank/preferred choice, second rank/alternative choice, third rank/usually inappropriate) based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guidelines showing preferred treatment strategies were subsequently developed for key clinical situations. RESULTS: The expert panel agreed on 88% of the options rated on a 9-point scale. Experts overwhelmingly approve atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychotic disorders. Risperidone was the best choice for first-episode and multiple-episode patients, and other new atypicals were rated first-line or high-second-line depending on the clinical situation. Clozapine and a long-acting injectable were other highly second-line options for atypical (where available) multi-attack patients. Expert dosing recommendations were closely aligned with drug inserts, and estimates of dose equivalence between antipsychotics followed a linear pattern. Experts considered 3-6 weeks to be an adequate trial of antipsychotics, but if there was a partial response they would wait a little longer (4-10 weeks) before making a major change in treatment regimen. Experts suggested trying to improve response by increasing the dose of atypical and depot antipsychotics before switching to a different agent"";"" Prior to the transition, there was less consensus on increasing the dose of conventional antipsychotics, possibly due to concern about side effects at higher doses. If switching is decided due to unsatisfactory response, risperidone was the specialist's first choice of switch, regardless of which drug was initially tried. Although there are some differences in expert recommendations on how many agents to try before switching to clozapine, the experts' responses suggest that switching to clozapine should be Clozapine, and it is the antipsychotic of choice for patients with suicidal behavior. Experts felt that cross-titration was the preferred strategy when switching between oral antipsychotics. When switching to an injectable antipsychotic therapy, experts stressed the importance of continuing oral antipsychotic therapy until therapeutic levels of the injectable are reached. Experts rated psychosocial interventions as the first choice strategy for partially compliant patients, and pharmacological interventions as first choice for patients with clear evidence of nonadherence. However, as it may be difficult to distinguish patients who are partially compliant from noncompliant, the editors recommended combining psychosocial and pharmacological interventions whenever possible to increase compliance. When patients relapsed due to compliance issues or there was any doubt about compliance, experts recommended the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics and would choose an atypical injectable when this option was available. Professionals will also consider using an injectable atypical antipsychotic (when available) in many clinical situations that do not involve compliance issues. Experts emphasized the importance of monitoring health problems such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, HIV risk behaviors, medical complications of substance use, excessive smoking and its effects, hypertension and amenorrhea in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment. Experts gave little support for either of these strategies, although most patients were prescribed additional therapies, multiple antipsychotics, and combinations of different classes of drugs (for example, antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers or antidepressants) to improve response. antidepressants for patients with dysphoria/depression, antidepressants or ECT for patients with suicidal behavior, and mood stabilizers for patients with aggression/severity. When asked about indicators of remission and recovery, while experts viewed acute improvement in psychotic symptoms as the most important predictor of remission, in multiple outcome domains (eg, assessing recovery. RESULTS: Experts had a high level of agreement on most of the key treatment questions in the survey. Within the limits of expert opinion and future future). With the expectation that research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for addressing common clinical dilemmas that arise in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders. They can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients on the relative merits of various interventions. It should be noted that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used when applying recommendations.",0,0,
1796,Expert consensus guide series. Treatment of behavioral emergencies 2005,"OBJECTIVES: Because of the hazards and barriers inherent in research in emergency settings, little data is available to guide clinicians on how best to manage behavioral emergencies. Key constructs such as agitation are not fully defined. This lack of empirical data prompted us to conduct an expert opinion survey, the results of which were published in the 2001 Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of Behavioral Emergencies. Several second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are now available in new formulations for the treatment of behavioral emergencies (eg, intramuscular [im] olanzapine and ziprasidone; ""fast-dissolving olanzapine and risperidone tablets). Critical questions are faced on the field. SGAs differ significantly from FGAs and each other and, like FGAs, have not been studied in unselected patients. Can SGAs be considered as a class, do all antipsychotics have similar anti-agitation effects in different conditions, and if equally effective, what limits might their safety profile impose? Should benzodiazepines (BNZs) be used alone non-specifically, while should antipsychotics be used more specifically to treat psychotic conditions? Few data are available on combinations of SGAs and BNZs, and the findings for combinations of traditional haloperidol plus a BNZ may not be relevant to combinations with SGAs. Culture is also evolving with greater emphasis on patient participation in treatment decisions. An international consensus is developing that the appropriate endpoint of behavioral emergency interventions is sedation rather than sedation. We conducted a new expert opinion survey to update the recommendations from the previous survey. METHODS: Written questionnaire consisting of 61 questions (1,020 choices) was mailed to 50 experts, 48 of which (96%) were received. The questionnaire aimed to define the level of agitation at which emergency interventions were appropriate, the extent of assessment based on urgency and patients' ability to cooperate, guiding principles for selecting interventions, and appropriate physical and medication strategies at various diagnostic confidence levels. provisional diagnoses and complex situations. A modified version of the RAND Corporation's 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions was used to score most options. Consensus was defined as the nonrandom distribution of scores by the chi-square ""goodness of fit"" test. We assigned each option a categorical ranking (line one/preferred, line two/alternative, line three/usually inappropriate) based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean. The ratings were used to develop guidelines for preferred strategies in key clinical situations. This study received financial support from multiple sponsors, with the panel being blind to sponsorship to reduce potential bias. Drug ratings are based only on responses from participants who have direct experience with each drug. In reporting implementation models, the panel was asked to respond based on actual data rather than estimates. RESULTS: The expert panel agreed on 78% of the options rated on a 9-point scale. The responses suggest that physicians can make a tentative diagnosis with some confidence and that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are selected differently based on diagnosis and other salient demographic and medical characteristics. BNZs are recommended when no data are available, there is no specific treatment (eg, personality disorder) or they may have certain benefits (eg, poisoning). A single SGA does not emerge as a non-specific substitute for haloperidol""; instead, different SGAs are preferred in a variety of situations, consistent with the available evidence. To the extent that haloperidol is recommended, it is almost always in combination with a BNZ; haloperidol alone is associated with this only. Conversely, use of SGAs alone is more often recommended, and the panel refrains from combining BNZs with some SGAs. Oral risperidone alone or in combination with a BNZ receives strong support in a variety of situations. Oral olanzapine is highly rated where studied. (eg schizophrenia, mania) similar to risperidone with slightly higher ratings than risperidone and slightly lower ratings where it has not been studied or where there may be safety concerns; there was less support for the combination of oral olanzapine with oral olanzapine a BNZ Schizophrenia or mania, olanzapine alone, alone or a BNZ combined with risperidone and halo-related agitation Peridol plus a BNZ for the oral treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is also a first line with strong support for combining divalproex with an antipsychotic for possible mania. Oral ziprasidone and quetiapine generally achieved similar second-line scores in most cases. If a parenteral agent is needed, im olanzapine alone has received slightly more support than im ziprasidone alone; however, there was greater support for im ziprasidone alone or in combination with a BNZ than for im olanzapine plus a BNZ, possibly reflecting safety concerns. For example, for the provisional diagnosis of schizophrenia, first-line parenteral options are im olanzapine or ziprasidone alone, or im haloperidol or ziprasidone combined with a BNZ. no data available or diagnosis includes medical comorbidity or intoxication When first response with risperidone, ziprasidone, or haloperidol fails, the panel recommended the addition of a BZD to antipsychotics. However, dosage is recommended when initial therapy with olanzapine or quetiapine has failed. Perphenazine has been consistently rated second-line and droperidol and chlorpromazine rec achieved overall third place ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines show that SGAs are now preferred for agitation in primary psychiatric disorders, but BNZs are preferred in other situations.",0,0,
1797,Appropriate Family Challenge: Pilot Intervention for Primary Care Childhood Obesity,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has increased dramatically over several decades, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended primary care practices as ideal places for the identification, education, and practice of therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study was to describe the implementation and outcomes of the Fit Family Challenge (FFC), a primary care-based childhood obesity intervention. METHODS: A single-intervention pilot project educating primary care practices in the implementation of childhood obesity guidelines and family-focused behavior change curriculum. A total of 29 family practice and pediatric community practices in Colorado participated. Participants included 290 patients aged 6 to 12 years with a body mass index (BMI) above the 85th percentile. The main outcome measure included the feasibility of implementing a childhood obesity program in primary care”; secondary outcomes were changes in BMI percentile, BMI z-scores, blood pressure, and changes in lifestyle factors related to childhood obesity. RESULTS: Implementation of the FFC is feasible, 9 Statistically significant changes were seen for decreases in BMI percentile and BMI z-scores for participants who completed 15 to 15 months of follow-up; lifestyle factors related to childhood obesity and food insecurity in Spanish-speaking families were associated with less follow-up time (P < .01) CONCLUSIONS: A primary care-based intervention for childhood obesity can result in significant clinical and lifestyle changes.",0,0,

The primary objectives of this pilot study were to 1) improve the GDM Management System (GooDMomS), a web-based pregnancy and postpartum behavioral intervention, and 2) evaluate the feasibility of the intervention. METHODS: In Phase 1, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with women with current or recent GDM Mellitus GDM to collect pilot data on the web-based response interface, content, and seek advice from women on improvements to improve the GooDMomS response site. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and independently reviewed to identify key themes with Atlas.ti v7.0. In phase 2, a single-arm feasibility study was conducted and 23 participants were enrolled in the GooDMomS program. Participants received web lessons, weight and glucose tracking, automated feedback, and access to a message board for peer support. The primary outcome was feasibility, including recruitment and retention and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of women who were within gestational weight gain (GWG) Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and were able to return to their pre-pregnancy weight after delivery. RESULTS: Comments from the semi-structured interviews focused on 1) the availability of the online self-monitoring diary and monitoring system, 2) access to a secure, reliable social network for peer support, and 3) the antenatal clinicians' online diary for clinical management. Overall, 21 (91%) completed the pregnancy stage. 15/21 (71%) of participants were within Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines for the GWG. Sixteen (70%) completed the postpartum phase. 7/16 (43%) and 9/16 (56%) of the participants returned to their pre-pregnancy weights at 6 and 30 weeks postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the feasibility of the GoodDMomS program. The results may have implications for web technology in perinatal care and inform the current care paradigm for women with GDM. The findings support further research by recruiting a larger sample of participants and comparing results with intervention and standard care.

DESIGN Multicenter, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Four Scottish National Health Service medical boards. PARTICIPANTS 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had a colonoscopy and histopathology-confirmed diagnosis of an adenoma after a positive fecal occult blood test result as part of the national bowel screening program. 163 were randomized to intervention and 166 to control. INTERVENTION Participants were randomized to a control group (weight loss handbook only) or 12-month intervention group (three face-to-face visits plus monthly 15-minute phone calls with a lifestyle counselor). A target of 7% body weight reduction was set and participants were given a personalized energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below what is required for weight maintenance) and body weight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored personal values related to self-assessed confidence, indecision, and weight. Behavioral strategies included goal setting, setting practice intentions, self-monitoring of body weight, and counselor feedback on reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS At 12 months, primary outcome data were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) participants in the control group. The mean weight loss in the intervention group was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) compared to 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4. 30) has been. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). The differences between the groups were significant in terms of waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood sugar level, diet and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to participation in the study. CONCLUSIONS Significant weight loss can be achieved with a diet and physical activity intervention initiated as part of a national colorectal cancer screening program, offering significant potential for disease risk reduction in older adults.

However, only a limited number of studies have examined the efficacy of such programs in patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of a structured, nurse-led patient education program and care plan in general practice on outcome parameters and events in patients with HFPEF. METHODS: Single-blind randomized clinical trial with an intervention of more than six months and follow-up for 12 additional months. Patients in the control group (n = 41) were managed according to Russian national guidelines. Patients in the intervention group (n = 44) received training on individual lifestyle changes and modifications of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, home exercise training and usual care, as well as weekly nurse consultations. RESULTS: Six months after inclusion, patients in the intervention group had significantly improved body mass index, waist circumference, six-minute walk test distance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, quality of life and level. from anxiety. After 18 months, there were 11 deaths (25%) or hospitalizations in the intervention group and 12 (29%) in the control group (P = 0.134). After 6 months follow-up, cardiovascular mortality and readmission rate were not significantly reduced: hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.17-1.28""; P = 0.197). After 18 months this was 0.85 (0.42-1.73;"". P = 0.658) . CONCLUSION: This primary care-based DMP for HFPEF patients improved patients' emotional state and quality of life, positively affected body weight, functional capacity and lipid profile, and reduced cardiac remodeling.",0,0,
1802,Effect of cost indicators on primary care physician laboratory test order.,"BACKGROUND Physicians are under increasing pressure to help control rising healthcare costs, despite their lack of knowledge of the cost implications of patient care decisions. PURPOSE To evaluate the impact of real-time display of laboratory costs on the primary care physician's ordering of common laboratory tests in the outpatient setting. DESIGN Interrupted time series analysis with a parallel control group. PARTICIPANTS Two hundred and fifteen primary care physicians (153 interventions and 62 controls) using a common electronic health record between April 2010 and November 2011. The setting was an alliance of five multi-specialty group practices in Massachusetts. INTERVENTION The average Medicare reimbursement rate for 27 laboratory tests, including 21 low-cost tests (<$40.00) and six high-cost tests (>$40.00), was displayed in an electronic health record at time of order. KEY MEASURES We compared the variation in monthly laboratory order rate between intervention and control physicians over 12 months pre-intervention and 6 months post-intervention. We surveyed all intervention and control physicians 6 months after intervention to assess attitudes regarding costs and cost indicators. KEY RESULTS Among the 27 laboratory tests, intervention doctors showed a significant decrease in order rates for five (19%) tests compared to control doctors. This included a significant relative reduction in order rates for four out of 21 (19%) low-cost laboratory tests and one of six (17%) high-cost laboratory tests. The majority of physicians (81%) reported that the intervention improved their knowledge of the relative costs of laboratory testing. CONCLUSIONS Real-time display of cost information in an electronic health record can lead to a modest reduction in sequencing of laboratory tests and is well received. Our study shows that electronic health records can serve as a tool to promote cost transparency and reduce the use of laboratory testing.",1,1,
1803,Impact of evidence-based guideline publication for the assessment and treatment of major depression in a managed behavioral health facility,"This study tests whether a managed behavioral health care facility influences adherence to practice guidelines for the treatment of major depression in a randomized guideline dissemination trial. Guidelines were distributed to mental health clinicians (N = 443) under one of three conditions: (1) a general mailing of guidelines to clinicians, (2) a mailing in which the guidelines were targeted at a patient starting treatment with a clinician, and (3) no mailing of instructions. The results showed no effect of guideline publication, as measured by patients' and clinicians' self-reports and episode characteristics derived from claim data, despite sentinel effects. The results also showed high clinician-reported rates of undertreatment for depression not detected in the claims data. The results suggest that mental health systems should look to other dissemination strategies to improve adherence to standards of care and improve the performance of self-employed clinicians.",0,0,

Unlike textbooks and reviews that seek to improve medical knowledge, guidelines seek to influence medical behavior. Scientific models of clinical decision-making, such as theory of action and empirical data on the effects of guidelines, suggest that guidelines do not always achieve their goals and may instead lead to a deterioration in the quality of medical care. Therefore, controlled clinical trials are needed to investigate whether physicians exposed to the guidelines provide better patient outcomes than physicians unfamiliar with the guidelines. Guidelines should be accepted as evidence-based only if positive effects have been demonstrated experimentally.",0,0,

1806,Effect of medication adherence on lung health outcomes in cystic fibrosis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patient compliance is becoming increasingly important as new drugs continue to appear to improve health in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Currently, compliance with pulmonary medications is approximately 50% for people with CF. There is recent research showing that poor compliance is linked to worse health outcomes. This review summarizes the latest research on the impact of compliance on lung health and highlights future research and clinical application areas to address this growing need. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that nonadherence is associated with increased hospitalizations and pulmonary exacerbations, lower baseline lung function, and longer lengths of stay. However, most of the research has been done using pharmacy refill records as an objective measure of adherence. Electronic monitoring of drugs provides more detailed information on patterns of use that can directly inform clinical care. In addition, there are few published clinical studies evaluating behavioral interventions to promote compliance. SUMMARY: Given recent research linking compliance with lung health outcomes, there is a growing need to measure and evaluate compliance in clinical care. As new drugs are approved for CF, methods for monitoring compliance also need to be developed and approved. Clinicians need to continue to assess barriers to compliance in order to individually tailor interventions to a patient's needs.",0,0,
1807,The effect of supported telemetric monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing and current management methods are unsustainable. Effective approaches are needed to support self-management. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine whether assisted telemetric monitoring of glycemic control and blood pressure results in reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; “primary outcome of long-term glycemic control) and secondary blood pressure outcomes. and weight in people with poorly controlled diabetes compared to a control group receiving regular care. METHODS/DESIGN: Design: multicenter, randomized controlled trial embedded qualitative study. Setting: Primary care in the UK in the Lothian, Kent, Glasgow and Borders areas. Participants: persons with type 2 diabetes and confirmed HbA1c>7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Intervention/comparison: randomization to intervention or control groups will be carried out by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. Participants in the intervention group will be shown how to use scales and blood glucose and blood pressure monitors that use Bluetooth wireless technology to transmit readings via a modem to a remote server. These participants will be asked to take morning and evening blood glucose measurements and weekly weight and blood pressure measurements at least twice a week. Measurements will be checked at least weekly by practice nurses, who will contact patients to adjust treatment according to guidelines and reinforce lifestyle recommendations. Participants in the control group will receive usual care. Individual training will be provided to all participants. Follow-up: measurements will be made at practices 9 months after randomization by research nurses blinded to separation. The primary outcome is HbA1c and the secondary outcome is daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight and quality-adjusted cost per life-year. Analysis: Treatment-oriented analyzes will be made. The sample size of 320 participants allows for a 20% cut-off to detect a 0.5% absolute (6 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA1c in the intervention group and has 80% power at 5% significance. The qualitative study will explore the experiences of patients and professionals using the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration number ISRCTN71674628.",0,0,

1809,The importance of doctor-patient communication in somatized patient care,"The term ""somatization"" refers to the manifestation of multiple somatic complaints that are not explained by organic changes. According to the literature, 15-25 percent of all medical visits are related to somatization. Because medical education does not place enough emphasis on the assessment of the possible psychological background of certain somatic symptoms, doctors may feel powerless and make unfair diagnosis and treatment efforts. Patients may also feel helpless and frustrated, and their anxiety and complaints may increase in intensity. Since stress is an important factor in the somatization process, reducing stress and improving coping are essential elements of chronic disease treatment guidelines. Evidence-based interventions range from brief counseling and medication to cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy. Reassociation, a short (10-30 minutes) structured intervention that can be applied in primary or secondary care, can in some cases result in significant reductions in somatic symptoms and anxiety.",0,0,
1810,Curative care study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study: CAROL improving care processes and quality of life of COPD patients in primary care: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The Swiss ministry of health launched a national quality program, 'QualiCCare', in 2011 to improve healthcare for COPD patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether participation in the COPD quality initiative ('QualiCCare') improves adherence to recommended clinical treatment. processes and demonstrates the impact of patients on COPD care and the impact that COPD has on a person's life. METHODS: CAROL is a clustered randomized controlled trial with randomization at the general practitioner (GP) level. Thirty GPs will be randomly assigned to an equally sized intervention group or control group. Regardless of the reason for the current consultation, each GP will sequentially approach patients aged 45 years and older with a smoking history >/= ten pack-years (PR). Patients with confirmed (by spirometric evaluation) COPD will be included in the study. General practitioners in the intervention group will receive 'QualiCCare' training that addresses aspects of knowledge, decision-making and behavior, as well as the delivery of care according to COPD quality indicators and evidence-based key elements. In the control group, no educational intervention will be applied and COPD patients will be treated as usual. The working period is one year. The primary outcome measure is an aggregated score of relevant clinical processes that define the elements in the care of patients with COPD: smoking cessation counseling, influenza vaccination, motivation for physical activity, appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient education, and shared care. Given a 90% power and a 5% alpha significance level, 15 GPs each recruiting eight patients in both arms would be required. With a default dropout rate of 20%, 288 patients will need to be included. CONCLUSION: The development and implementation of interventions that add value to COPD care is important for quality and effectiveness. Ways of care that change physicians' knowledge and behavior have the potential to improve care by transferring knowledge to clinical practice.

1811,Impact of a physician and patient intervention program on dietary intake,"BACKGROUND: There is a need for effective dietary interventions for patients with hypertension in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the separate and combined effect of a physician intervention (MD-I) and a patient intervention (PT-I) on the dietary intake of patients with hypertension. DESIGN: A 2x2 nested design, randomized controlled trial conducted over 18 months. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 physicians and 574 ambulatory hypertension patients. INTERVENTION: MD-I included training modules for the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension, hypertension management guidelines and lifestyle change. The PT-I included lifestyle coaching to adopt Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating patterns, reduce sodium intake, manage weight, increase exercise, and reduce alcohol intake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intakes were measured with the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire. Compliance with the DASH diet model was estimated by a DASH score. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The main effects and interactions of MD-I and PT-I were evaluated using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: After 6 months of intervention, MD-I participants significantly increased their intake of potassium, fruit, juices and carbohydrates""; decreased their fat intake;"" and improving overall diet quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index. The PT-I intervention resulted in increased intakes of carbohydrates, protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, fruit and juices, vegetables, dairy, and Healthy Eating Index scores, and decreased intakes of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sweets, and added foods. oils/oils/sweets. Additionally, PT-I improved the overall DASH compliance score. The change in DASH score was significantly associated with changes in blood pressure and weight at 6 months. At 18 months, most changes were back to baseline levels, including the DASH score. RESULTS: Both MD-I and PT-I improved eating habits at 6 months with some lasting effects at 18 months. Although all observed dietary changes were consistent with DASH food targets or food group guidelines, only the PT-I intervention was effective in improving the overall DASH adherence score. This finding confirms the role of medical nutrition therapy in long-term intensive interventions for hypertension risk reduction and weight management, and highlights the need to develop care strategies. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of collaborations between physicians, registered dietitians and other dietetic practitioners and lay health counselors when helping patients make healthy behavioral changes.",0,0,

Progetto Oncology Feminine,"BACKGROUND: As part of a multi-annual educational intervention supported by the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities, patterns of care for breast cancer patients in Italian general hospitals were followed to identify areas of practice where quality is needed. improvement. DESIGN: Information on diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at 63 general hospitals in eight Italian regions, performed on 1724 consecutive breast cancer patients, was collected retrospectively from medical records. Quality of care was assessed with a diagnostic and therapeutic score based on the observed degree of adherence to predetermined action plans. RESULTS: The median value of the overall diagnosis and staging score was 60%. Approximately one-third (38%) of surgical operations were inappropriate: one-quarter (24%) of patients with stage I-II disease underused radical surgery (ie Halsted mastectomy) and patients with small tumors (ie, < or = 2 cm). Chronological age influenced the behavior of doctors: older patients, regardless of their general condition, were more likely to have less intensive diagnostic examination and less appropriate surgical treatment (with more frequent use of an unnecessary radical operation and less use of limited surgery). health situation. The presence of one or more co-morbidities was associated with failure of axillary clearance and lower use of conservative surgery regardless of age. CONCLUSION: Consistent with other studies, this study confirms the existence of a clinically significant effect of patient age on diagnostic and therapeutic behavior and the use of unnecessary radical surgical procedures. The article discusses the implications of these findings for the next phase of the educational project where practice guidelines will be developed and implemented to improve the quality of care for breast cancer patients.",0,0,
1813,"The intellectual structure and essence of the information use domain: A longitudinal analysis of author co-citation, 1945 to 2004","Background It has been argued that science and society are in the midst of an extensive renegotiation of the social contract between science and society, with society becoming a much more active partner in knowledge creation. On the one hand, new forms of knowledge production are emerging, on the other hand, both science and society experience a rapid acceleration in new forms of knowledge use. Simultaneously, since the Second World War, the science that underpins the field of knowledge use has grown exponentially. There are few in-depth reviews in this area and no comprehensive analyzes using bibliometric methods. Methods Using bibliometric analysis, specifically first author co-citation analysis, our group undertook a field analysis of the information use domain, tracing its historical development between 1945 and 2004. Our aim is to map the historical development of knowledge use as a field and to identify the changing intellectual structure of scientific fields. We analyzed more than 5,000 articles using citation data from the Web of Science. The search terms were combinations of knowledge, research, evidence, guidelines, ideas, science, innovation, technology, theory and use of information, use and uptake. Conclusions We provide an overview of the intellectual structure and how it has changed over six decades. The area was not wide enough to be represented by a common citation map until the mid-1960s. Our findings show strong growth from the mid-1960s to 2004, as well as the emergence of specific areas reflecting diverse collectives of intellectual activity and thought. Until the mid-1980s, the main areas focused on innovation diffusion, technology transfer and knowledge use. Evidence-based medicine emerged in the mid-1980s, a fourth scientific field that began slowly and then grew rapidly. For decades, the field has been ruled by one person, Everett Rogers, and a single paradigm, diffusion of innovation. Conclusion We conclude that the accepted view that social science disciplines are in a state where no accepted set of principles or theory guides research (that is, they are pre-paradigm) cannot be supported for this field. Second, we document the emergence of a new field in the field of information use, evidence-based medicine. Third, we conclude that Everett Rogers was the dominant figure in the field and, until the advent of evidence-based medicine, his representation of the general diffusion model was the dominant paradigm in the field.",0,0,
1814,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS): rationale and design of a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 12-month follow-up versus clinician-administered CBT for moderate to severe irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, often disabling gastrointestinal disorder, all of whose symptoms do not have satisfactory medical or dietary treatment. One of the few experimentally validated treatments, if available, involves a specific type of psychological therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy, which is typically administered over several months by trained practitioners in tertiary care settings. There is an urgent need to develop more efficient versions of CBT that require minimal professional assistance but retain the efficacy profile of clinical-based CBT. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial to evaluate whether a self-administered version of CBT is at least as effective as standard CBT and more effective than an attention control at reducing core symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract. IBS and its burden (eg, distress, deterioration in quality of life, etc.) in moderately to severely affected IBS patients. Additional goals are to assess the durability of treatment response over a 12-month period at three-month intervals; identify clinically useful patient characteristics associated with outcome as a way to understand subgroups of participants for whom CBT is most beneficial; theory-based shift explaining how and why CBT works Identify the mechanisms (active ingredients) and evaluate the economic costs and benefits of CBT Between August 2010, when IBSOS began recruiting subjects, and February 2012, IBSOS randomized 171 of 480 patients. Findings revealed the social and economic costs of improving the health of IBS patients.

1815,Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study 2 (IDES-2): a long-term behavioral intervention for adopting and maintaining a physically active lifestyle,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA)/exercise has become an integral part of the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, current guidelines are difficult to implement in this population due to a number of barriers, particularly the lack of acceptable, feasible, and validated behavioral intervention strategies. This manuscript reports the rationale, study design and methods, and design considerations of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)-2, a randomized controlled trial that tested the efficacy of a behavior modification strategy in increasing total daily FA and reducing sedentary time. SED time) in patients with T2DM. METHODS/DESIGN: From January 7, 2014, IDES_2 began enrolling 300 patients with known T2DM for at least 1 year at three tertiary outpatient diabetes clinics in Rome. Additional requirements are age 40 to 80, body mass index 27 to 40 kg/m(2), sedentary lifestyle, and at least 6 months of physically inactive, unassisted walking 1.6 km and fitness after cardiovascular assessment. Patients are randomized to intervention or control groups by center and by age and type of diabetes treatment at each center. Patients in the intervention (INT) group (n = 150) receive annual theoretical and practical exercise counseling consisting of collective behavior change techniques (one individual theoretical counseling session plus eight individual theoretical and practical exercise counseling twice weekly). 3 years. Patients in the control (CON) group (n = 150) receive standard care, including general physician recommendations for daily PA. Primary results are total daily PA and SED time as measured objectively using an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disorders, well-being/depression, and health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: The behavioral intervention strategy tested in IDES_2 is based on solid theoretical foundations and employs several behavior modification techniques, two of which have been found to improve the effectiveness of behavioral intervention. In addition, physicians and exercise specialists are specifically trained for PA/exercise counseling/prescribing and monitoring, respectively, in subjects afflicted with metabolic disorders. Finally, the large sample size, long study duration, and objective measurement of PA allow statistically significant and scientifically sound conclusions to be drawn about the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention in T2DM patients.

1819,The LIFESTYLE study: costs and implications of a structured lifestyle program to reduce the need for fertility treatment and improve reproductive outcomes in overweight and obese subfertile women. A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, 30% of subfertile women are overweight or obese and there is currently no agreement on fertility care for them. Data from observational and small intervention studies suggest that reducing weight will increase the chances of conception, reduce pregnancy complications, and improve perinatal outcomes, but this has not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials. This study will evaluate the cost and effects of a six-month structured lifestyle program targeting weight loss followed by traditional fertility care (intervention group) compared to traditional fertility care only (control group) in overweight and obese subfertile women. We hypothesize that the intervention will reduce the need for fertility treatment, reduce pregnancy complications associated with overweight, and improve perinatal outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter randomized controlled trial in subfertile women (18-39 years) with a body mass index between 29 and 40 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were azoospermia, use of donor semen, severe endometriosis, premature ovarian failure, endocrinopathies, or pre-existing hypertensive disorders. In the intervention group, the goal can be achieved by a combination of at least 5% to 10% weight loss, diet, increased physical activity, and behavior change over a six-month period. If, after six months, she has not conceived, these patients will begin fertility treatment according to Dutch fertility guidelines. In the control group, treatment will be started according to the Dutch fertility guidelines, regardless of the patient's weight. OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure is a healthy single born after at least 37 weeks of gestation after vaginal delivery. Secondary outcome parameters including pregnancy outcome and complications, percentage of women requiring fertility treatment, clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates, body weight, quality of life, and costs. The data will be analyzed according to the goal-to-treat principle and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be made. conducted to compare costs and health effects in the intervention and control group. CONCLUSION: The trial will provide evidence for the costs and effects of a lifestyle intervention aimed at weight reduction in overweight and obese subfertile women, and will guide clinicians in the management of these patients.

The questionnaires will help identify the diagnosis and extent of nicotine addiction, as well as fingerprints of patients with a smoking career. The ICD-10 Code and the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Test are used. There is no specified treatment without the optimal motivation of the patient. Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model is widely accepted for dividing the motivational stadium into precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, and action. Many other factors such as previous experience, disaster scenarios, self-efficacy and therapeutic modality selection are important for optimal outcome. 90% of a gatekeeper's job is minimal intervention. This means individually tailored arguments to shift the patient's motivation to quit smoking. The concept is defined in the rules of the five Rs with relevance, risks, rewards, roadblocks and repetition. Following these criteria, the gatekeeper achieves up to 60% positive change in motivation with just one minimal intervention. Smoking cessation guidelines around the world are very similar and indicate an A-level rating for nicotine replacement, behavioral therapy via bupropion or varenicline, and drug synergy. The choice of any other regimen is either less efficient or anecdotal and results in a further reduction in the smoker's life expectancy. The gatekeeper has the infrastructure, knowledge and confidence of his patient to act as the disease manager. A successful treatment is possible with approximately seven consultations over six months, and the success rate is expected to be even higher than the values in drug research. Smokers should be informed by health institutions to avoid self-therapy and expert help should be sought. The gatekeeper is an ideal candidate.",0,0,

The trial aimed to test whether this multimodal intervention improved adherence to recommended targets for a range of surrogate indicators related to blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium-phosphate changes. The trial also tested whether the same intervention could slow CKD progression and prevent CV complications in CKD patients. METHODS: Twenty-two kidney clinics were randomized into 2 arms: an intervention arm performing a multi-method quality improvement intervention and a control arm providing standard care. Surrogate indicators were measured to assess changes in blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium-phosphate. RESULTS: Although the vast majority (95%) of patients enrolled in this study were treated with antihypertensive drugs, baseline BP targets (proteinuria level and specific for diabetes) were found in only 45% of patients without proteinuria and 14% and 18% of patients with Proteinuric and diabetic only, respectively. 'I. In hypertensive patients, the use of diuretics was less than necessary, and approximately 80% of patients had a salt excretion of >100 mmol/24 hours. Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were off-target in over 40% of patients, but only 60% of these were on statins. The vast majority of CKD patients were obese or overweight. The proportion of smokers was relatively small (13%), and 37% of patients had quit, indicating that patients are aware of the health risks of smoking.

1824,Medical office of the 21st century (MOXXI): effectiveness of computerized decision support in reducing inappropriate prescribing in primary care.,"Background: Drug-related adverse events are common in the elderly, and inappropriate prescribing is a preventable risk factor. Our aim was to determine whether inappropriate prescribing could be reduced if primary care physicians had computer-based access to information on all prescriptions and automatic alerts for potential prescribing problems. Methods: We randomly assigned 107 primary care physicians with at least 100 patients aged 66 years and older (12 560 in total) to a group receiving computerized decision-making support (CDS) or a control group. Doctors in the CDS group were able to access information on current and past prescriptions through a dedicated computer link to the state's seniors' drug insurance program. When any of the 159 clinically relevant prescribing problems were detected by the CDS software, the physician received an alert describing the nature of the problem, possible consequences, and alternative treatment. The rate of initiation and termination of potentially unsuitable prescriptions was evaluated over a 13-month period. Results: 2 months before the study, 31.8% of patients in the CDS group and 33.3% of patients in the control group wrote at least 1 potentially inappropriate prescription. During the study, the number of new potentially unsuitable prescriptions per 1000 visits was significantly lower (18%) in the CDS group than in the control group (relative ratio [RR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.98) but potentially unsuitable Differences between groups in non-prescription discontinuation were significant only for drug interactions caused by therapeutic relapse (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.99–2.79) and prescriptions written by the study physician and another physician. study physician (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.98–4.70).

1825,The moderator effect of interventions promoting compliance with clients on evidence-based practice for children and adolescents with mental health problems.,"Poor adherence of children and adolescents to evidence-based psychosocial interventions remains a major barrier to treatment effectiveness. To maintain patient engagement, researchers and clinicians have used a range of engagement-promoting strategies, from phone calls and letters to providing transportation costs and childcare motivational therapies. However, the effect of adherence promoters on intervention outcomes has not been reported. This study examined the modulating effect of strategies promoting adherence in a survey and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials on cognitive behavioral treatments, interpersonal therapy, and psychoeducation for children and adolescents with mental health problems (k = 33). The results showed the type and intensity of moderated study effect sizes of loyalty promoters by client characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis). Preliminary findings suggest that men have higher effect sizes when more intense commitment development efforts are used. Efforts to increase adjustment have been associated with lower effect sizes for youth diagnosed with externalizing disorders. The results of this study suggest guidelines for future research to clarify clinical guidelines for maximizing persistence in evidence-based psychotherapy.",0,0,

George Beam argues that all survey research tools, including surveys, face-to-face interviews, and focus groups, produce unreliable and potentially inaccurate results. Because those who rely on survey research only see the answers to the questions, it is impossible for them or anyone else to evaluate the results. They do not know whether the answers correspond to the real behavior of the respondents (objective phenomena) or their true beliefs and ideas (subjective phenomena). Reliable knowledge can only be obtained through observation, experimentation, multiple data sources, formal model building and testing, document analysis and comparison. In fifteen chapters divided into six sections - The Ubiquity of Survey Research, The Problem, Question Tools, Question Environments, Soldiers and Appropriate Methods and Research Designs - The Questionnaire Research Problem, the environments in which questioning tools, questioning and answering occur, and the survey researchers themselves distorting the results. makes the answers unreliable. The last two chapters and appendices examine observation, other methods of data collection, and research designs that can produce true or accurate information, and show how reliance on survey research can and must be overcome.

1838,QICKD trial protocol: a randomized cluster trial to compare low systolic BP with quality improvement interventions in primary care chronic kidney disease (CKD).,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a relatively newly recognized but common long-term condition affecting 5% to 10% of the population. Effective management of CKD with emphasis on tight blood pressure (BP) control reduces cardiovascular risk and slows the progression of CKD. Currently, there is an unprecedented increase in referrals to specialist renal services, often found in tertiary care centres, which are inconvenient for patients and waste resources. National and international CKD guidelines include quality targets for primary care. However, a rigorous assessment of strategies for implementing these guidelines has not been undertaken. This study aims to test whether quality improvement interventions improve first-line treatment of high BP in CKD, reduce cardiovascular risk, and slow kidney disease progression. with the usual practice. The two interventions include: prompt and supervisory education and the provision of clinical practice guidelines. The study population will be all individuals with CKD from general practice across eight sites across England. Randomization will occur at the general applications level. The intended sample (three arms of 25 treatments) powers the study to detect a 3 mmHg difference in systolic BP between different quality improvement interventions. An additional 10 applications per arm will receive a questionnaire to measure any change in confidence in CKD management. Follow-up will take place in two years. Results will be measured using anonymized routinely collected data extracted from practical computer systems. Our primary outcome measure will be reduction of systolic blood pressure in subjects with CKD and hypertension at 2 years. Secondary outcomes will include biomedical outcomes and quality markers, including practitioner confidence in CKD management. A small group of practitioners (n = 4) will be involved in an in-depth process evaluation. We will use time series data to examine the natural history of CKD in the community. Finally, we will make an economic evaluation based on a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of each intervention.",0,0,
1839,Quality of diabetes care for Gullah families in South Carolina,"Empirical evidence from the Diabetes Control and Complication Study (DCCT) suggests that maintaining normal glycemic control can prevent both microvascular and macrovascular disease in people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (DCCT, 1993). Adults with T2DM are also more likely to have hypertension (73% [HTN]), and patients with both are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop diabetic complications compared to the general population (CDC, 2005). The purpose of this descriptive study was to 1) describe the quality of diabetes care received by Gullah families participating in the Project Sugar research study; and 2) compare Gullah's quality of care with the national sample in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Diabetes Report Card, using two blood pressure and HbA1c indicators. was a secondary analysis from a main study comparing selected data with the CDC Diabetes Report Card, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Socio-demographic and clinical data from 1,057 research participants (N = 1,057) Overall, compared with the national sample in the CDC Report Card, HbA1c greater than 9.5% mg/dL was higher among Gullahs (18% versus 30.2%) and blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg was lower (29). Almost half of the gulahs (45.9%) had foot pain, claudication and kidney infection, and renal complications of dialysis (7.3%) He reported neurovascular complications such as Gullah study participants are at risk for diabetes-related complications.

1840,The rational patient and beyond: The effects of adherence to treatment in persons with psychiatric disabilities.,"Objective: Many people with psychiatric disabilities do not benefit from evidence-based practices because they often do not seek or fully comply with them. One way for psychologists to make sense of this rehabilitation and health decision process and subsequent behavior (whose commitment may be seen as one) is to propose a ""rational patient""; that is, decisions are made deliberately by weighing the perceived costs and benefits of treatment. intervention options However, social psychological research suggests limitations for a rational theory of the patient influencing health-related decision-making patterns. Design: The research literature was reviewed for studies of rational patient models and empirically supported alternative theories. Special focus is on models. Outcomes regarding decisions regarding rehabilitation strategies for psychiatric disability: Rational patient concepts have evolved from a variety of psychological models, including the health belief model, the protection motivation theory, and the planned behavior theory. Various implementation strategies have evolved to encourage rational decision-making. However, research also suggests that it is limited. ions to rational negotiations of health. (1) Rather than being thoughtfully and consciously considered, many health decisions are implicit and potentially occur outside of awareness. (2) Decisions are not always planned; Often, it is the immediate needs of a context that have the greatest impacts, rather than an earlier balance of costs and benefits. (3) Cold cognitions generally do not dictate the process; ""emotional factors play an important role in health decisions. Each of these limitations suggests additional implementation strategies that facilitate a person's health decisions. Conclusion: Older models of rational decision making need to be replaced.

Such trials may be pre- or post-marketing studies. For a study's findings to result in a change in practice, they must be reliable and meet basic methodological criteria. However, it is appropriate to complete this dual assessment using an assessment checklist appropriate for each category of users, ie doctors and patients who are sometimes directly informed by the media, and the prescribing Regulatory Authority. Roundtable members proposed the 'Giens 2003 checklist'. It consists of an interpretative semi-quantitative assessment checklist based on simple messages about the application. Critical evaluation is a necessary prelude to the process of distributing results to the various interested parties (healthcare professionals, patients, patient organisations, the media and the general public) and informing these parties in easily understandable but accurate terms. Behavior change and/or the publication of guidelines and practical application of the results are the next steps where a certain lag time is inevitable.

The study was conducted in a primary health care facility in northern Jordan. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two dyslipidemia patients were randomized to intervention and control groups and followed for 6 months. Intervention group patients were followed extensively by a clinical pharmacist who worked closely with physicians in controlling their lipid profile, according to the third edition of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel, while control group patients were provided with standard medical care. The main outcome measures the percentage of patients on the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target in the intervention group compared to the percentage of patients on the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target in the control group at the end of the study. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five patients completed the study period. After 6 months, 94.5% of intervention group patients and 71.2% of control patients had their target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (P value < 0.001, Pearson Chi-Square) compared to 24.7% and 28.8% at baseline, respectively. test) reached. Most of the pharmacists' recommendations (90.4%) were followed by physicians, and total lipid-lowering agent use increased to 91.8% for intervention group patients and 86.5% for control patients, compared to baseline 69.9% and 78.8%.

BACKGROUND: Nurses/social workers are in intense contact with clients with intellectual disabilities. Despite this key position, the contribution of nurses/social workers to the diagnosis of mental health problems and compulsive behaviors is quite limited. They developed the Diagnostic Guide. This article evaluates the application of this guide on the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers and the role of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process DESIGN: A comparative multi-case study design was used in this study. heat METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative research methods. RESULTS: Studying the 'Diagnostic Guide for Anxiety and Compulsive Behaviors' resulted in a statistically significant increase in knowledge and self-efficacy among nurses/social workers in the experimental condition compared to nurses/social workers in the control condition. Nurses/social workers and psychologists appreciated the more active contribution of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process. CONCLUSION: Working with the guide increased the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers, and enabled nurses/social workers to participate more actively in the diagnosis process.

1848,The role of relationship-based developmentally supportive neonatal intensive care in reinforcing outcomes for preterm infants.,"This article details the conceptual framework, clinical application and effectiveness of a relationship-based developmental supportive approach to neonatal intensive care, called NIDCAP (Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Programme). The results of the approach are reported in relation to infant health and development, reduction of hospital costs and family cohesion. The approach is driven by a neurodevelopmental framework for understanding preterm infants and relies on the capacity of professionals to collaborate with each other and with families to support infants' medical, developmental and emotional well-being. The primary tool for clinical practice is detailed behavioral observation with subsequent recommendations for individualized care based on the infant's current functioning and clear developmental goals. A number of key components of developmental care delivery have been identified, including strategies for coordinated discharge planning and linkage to community services. Voices of individual clinicians highlight the transition from protocol-based to relationship-based care.",0,0,
1849,The role of stimulants in the treatment of preschool children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.,"Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can begin early, starting before age 6. Despite the significant number of preschool-aged children who can be diagnosed with ADHD, there is limited controlled data on pharmacological interventions increasingly used in this population. A 1990 review showed that 34% of pediatricians and 15% of family physicians prescribed psychostimulant drugs to preschoolers with ADHD, and pharmacoepidemiological studies show that stimulant use in preschool children increased in the 1990s. Unfortunately, only six controlled trials with a total enrollment of less than 200 have been conducted using these drugs in preschool children. While these small studies provide some evidence of some benefit from the use of methylphenidate in preschool children with ADHD, more data is critically needed. The practice parameters developed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide some guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of young children with ADHD, but are primarily based on research in elementary school-aged children. The ongoing PATS (Preschool ADHD Treatment Study), funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, will provide important clinical guidance for diagnostic considerations and intervention strategies for children 3-5 years of age with ADHD. Until the release of data from the PATS study, clinicians must rely on developmental assessment skills, standardized rating tools available, reports on the child from multiple sources of information, and information on the risks and benefits of available pharmacological and behavioral treatments to treat preschoolers. children with ADHD effectively",0,0,
1850,The role of surveillance in the treatment of small renal masses,"Incidentally detected small renal masses (SRMs) have increased significantly in recent years due to the widespread use of advanced cross-sectional imaging. A significant number of incidental SRMs are diagnosed in older patients who are more likely to undergo imaging for other medical problems. The natural history of SRMs has not been well understood historically because most masses are surgically removed soon after diagnosis. Several reports on surveillance of SRMs have been published in the last few years. According to a recent meta-analysis, SRMs have variable growth rates with an average of 0.28 cm/year when followed conservatively with serial imaging. Larger series with longer follow-up are needed, but a significant number of small tumors appear to have a lazy behavior with slow growth rate and limited progression tendency. The standard of care for augmenting SRMs is surgery. Up to one-third of surgically removed tumors <4 cm are histologically benign. The results of current surgical treatment of histologically confirmed, <4 cm, renal cell carcinomas are excellent, but this has not resulted in a reduction in mortality. Based on these considerations and the available data on the natural history of SRMs, it seems reasonable to think that we may be overtreating these lesions. This is especially true for elderly or unfit patients with reduced life expectancy. In these selected patients and patients who refuse active therapy, it seems reasonable to recommend an initial period of active surveillance for incidental SRMs and delayed intervention for tumors that will exhibit rapid growth during follow-up. Percutaneous needle biopsies of renal tumors can be performed safely using modern techniques and have the potential to characterize SRMs in histological diagnosis, thus allowing better selection of the most appropriate conservative or active therapy for each individual patient.",0,0,
1851,Role of theory in research for the development and evaluation of patient safety practices,"Theories provide a way to understand and predict the effects of patient safety practices (PSPs), interventions to prevent or mitigate harm from healthcare, or the risks of such harm. Yet most published reviews make little or no reference to theory, thus hampering efforts to generalize findings from one context to another. Theories from a wide variety of disciplines are potentially relevant for research on PSPs. The theory can be used in research to explain clinical and organizational behavior, guide the development and selection of PSPs, and evaluate their implementation and mechanisms of action. An important recommendation from an expert consensus process is that researchers should define the theoretical basis for selected intervention components or provide a clear logic model for ""why this PSP should work.""

Irish island. CHD is a common cause of death and a significant cause of morbidity in Ireland. Secondary prevention has been proposed as a key strategy to reduce CHD mortality levels, and general practice has been highlighted as an ideal setting for secondary prevention interventions. Current indications show substantial room for improvement in providing secondary prevention for patients with established heart disease on the island of Ireland. The review literature recommends structured programs with continued support and follow-up of patients; providing training tailored to practice needs to access evidence of the effectiveness of secondary prevention; structured recall programs that also take into account individual practice needs; and patient-centered consultations accompanied by attention to disease management guidelines. METHODS: SPHERE was a cluster randomized controlled trial that recruited 960 patients from 48 practices at three study centers (Belfast, Dublin and Galway) with administration-level randomization to intervention and control groups.Primary outcomes were blood pressure, total cholesterol, physical and mental health status ( SF-12) and hospital readmissions.

1854,Standard of Care: A Case Report and Ethical Analysis,"Increasingly, doctors are allowing their perceived legal responsibilities to supersede their clinical judgment. Misunderstandings surrounding the term ""standard of care"" have fostered fears of responsibility and led to defensive medicine practices. Physicians may view the standard of care as a technical or legal requirement, but the optimal standard will be one based on detailed knowledge of the patient's medical history and personal situation. It will include the clinical judgment of the physician combining specific technical and legal knowledge with clinical experience in the care of patients. Sometimes, such judgment may conflict with a court's judgment that takes into account technical and legal information without the benefit of clinical judgment.

1857,Systematic effect of gain and loss framed messages on interest and use of different types of health behaviour.,"Systematically framing health messages in terms of gains or losses influences the behavior people adopt. Rothman and Salovey hypothesized that the relative impact of win-loss-framed messages depends on people's perceptions of the risk or uncertainty associated with adopting the proposed behavior. Specifically, messages with a loss-frame are more effective at promoting behavior that detects (screening) disease, while messages with a gain-frame are more effective at promoting behaviors that confirm (preventing) health. Two experiments provide direct testing of this conceptual framework. In Experiment 1, participants' willingness to take action after reading about a new illness depended on how the information was framed and the type of behavior encouraged. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings with the real health problem of gum disease. Leaflets with earnings-frames increased interest in a plaque-fighting mouthwash, while brochures with lost-frames increased interest in a plaque-detecting mouthwash.

1861,UPBEAT depression and coronary heart disease programme: using the UK Medical Research Council framework to design a complex nurse-led intervention for use in primary care,"Background: Depression is common in coronary heart disease (CHD) and increases the incidence of coronary symptoms and death in patients with CHD. Interventions that can be used in primary care are needed to improve both mood and cardiac outcomes. The UPBEAT-UK research program has been funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to explore the relationship between CHD and depression and develop a new intervention for use in primary care. METHODS: Using Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines to develop and evaluate complex interventions, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative research to develop a nurse-led intervention in primary care to improve mood and cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD and depression. Iterative literature review was used to identify evidence and theory to synthesize our empirical work and inform intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a primary care-based nurse-led personalized care intervention that uses elements of case management to promote self-management. Following the biopsychosocial assessment, a personalized care plan is created. Nurses trained in behavior modification techniques make it easier for patients to address issues that are important to them. The identification and use of available resources is encouraged. Nurse time is protected by phone monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of mailed reminders in improving diabetes management. The reminder included a letter from the individual's primary care physician (PCP), a self-care handbook, a preventative care checklist, and specific recommendations for routine monitoring and receiving screening. METHODS: Of 195 PCPs working in a large group practice, 111 agreed to randomize adult patients with diabetes to either reminder (n=1,641) or usual care (n=1,668). Using data from automated databases, we fit generalized estimation equations to evaluate the effect of reminder receipt on fasting lipid profile and glycosylated hemoglobin test, expanded retinal exam receipt, and frequency of visits and glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterol levels at 6 and 12 months following randomization. In the year following randomisation. RESULTS: Reminder and usual care recipients did not differ in sociodemographic, clinical, or prior test characteristics. At 6 months following randomization, reminder recipients were more likely to receive a retinal exam (odds ratio [OR], 1.29""; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.12 to 1.49) and a diabetes visit (OR, 1.28; 95). %CI, 1.12 to 1.47.

1863,Use of laboratory intervention to stop the flow of fresh frozen plasma,"Four laboratory intervention methods were tested by the hospital blood bank to replace the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Over a one-year period, a usage audit was serially initiated with feedback to physicians, a recurrent training program was introduced that defined guidelines for the use of FFP for home workers, a form was submitted requiring justification for FFP orders, and a policy was established that required pathologist approval for normal or coagulation work. Overall, when comparing the period following all forms of intervention (February 1986-October 1986) with the baseline period before any form of intervention (July 1984-March 1985), FFP use decreased by 52% versus an increase of 17%. red blood cell use. It was concluded that blood bankers could significantly change the use of this product by using established methods to change doctor ordering behavior.",0,0,
1864,Using simulation for training teamwork skills in healthcare: how low can you go?,"High fidelity simulation has become a popular technique for training teamwork skills in high-risk industries such as aerospace, healthcare, and nuclear power generation. Simulation is a powerful training tool because it allows the instructor to systematically control the program of practice, the presentation of feedback, and the introduction (or suppression) of environmental distractions in a safe, controlled learning environment. Unfortunately, many in the education community have come to use the terms simulation and high-quality simulation almost synonymously. This is unfortunate because doing so puts an undue emphasis on instructional technology to the detriment of more important issues such as the aims, content and design of education. It also perpetuates several myths: simulation accuracy is one-dimensional, or higher levels of simulation accuracy lead to increased training effectiveness. The authors propose a typology of simulation accuracy and provide examples of how different classes of simulation have been successfully used to train teamwork skills in high-risk industries. Guidelines are also provided to maximize the utility of simulation for training teamwork skills in healthcare.",0,0,
1865,Use of nicotine inhalers to quit smoking,"OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness of nicotine inhaler among nurse practitioners (NPs) by providing clinical and practical information on the use of nicotine inhaler as a treatment option for smoking cessation. DATA SOURCES: This included data-driven and review articles in the medical literature, tobacco use and addiction clinical practice guideline, and Medline and Cinahl search engines. The criteria for the search keywords were ""nicotine inhaler"" and ""nicotine replacement therapy"". The first survey was conducted in December 2004. RESULTS: The nicotine inhaler was tested to be safe and effective in tobacco cessation treatment. Clinical trials show that the nicotine inhaler is useful alone or in addition to other pharmacological treatments. Current national guidelines recommend the use of a nicotine inhaler for smoking cessation treatment. APPLICATIONS FOR APPLICATION: The nicotine inhaler is suitable for many different smokers, including certain types of heart patients. NPs may incorporate a nicotine inhaler into a group of nicotine replacement therapies to enable smokers to be successful in quitting tobacco.",0,0,

1868,Theory and practice in the management of depressive disorders,"Scientific, professional, and government agencies have intensified their efforts in recent years to formulate guidelines for the treatment of depression so that medical practice meets these standards and thereby improves patient care. 'Evidence-based medicine' demands that medical practice make explicit reference to the best available scientific knowledge. Empirical data on the epidemiology of care show that there are large differences between guidelines and routine practice. Undetected mental disorders vary between 45% and 90%. Only 1 in 10 people suffering from depression receive adequate treatment. Treatment is inadequate because up to 50% of treatments are terminated prematurely and patient non-compliance prevents appropriate treatment, as the doses prescribed are routinely too low. Psychological treatment is provided in only 60% of cases who need it and is often non-specific, ie listening or giving advice. In addition, there are large regional variations in prescribing patterns, indicating that treatment is influenced by many non-medical factors. Empirical studies show that informing physicians and even measures to improve recognition alone are not sufficient to change treatment behavior. But better disease outcomes can be demonstrated, at least for more severe cases, if measures are taken to directly improve treatment interventions. If he is to understand that the therapist is not following treatment guidelines, he must first understand the medical decision-making process. Action theory provides a model that combines theoretical and empirical knowledge, goal setting, medical and emotional assessment, and operational procedures. On the basis of this theory, future guidelines should specify the context in which they claim to be valid, be empirically tested for their applicability and impact on patient outcomes, and appropriate attention should be paid to non-medical factors that have a major impact. about medical practice.",0,0,
1869,Therapeutic improvement: Nursing intervention category for patients diagnosed with Readiness for Therapeutic Regime Management,"OBJECTIVES: To introduce a new category of nursing intervention called therapeutic empowerment. BACKGROUND: Less than half of North Americans follow their doctor's recommendations for diet and exercise, even if it's crucial to their health or recovery. It is imperative that nurses think of new ways to promote healthy behaviors. Therapeutic healing aims to provide such a new approach. Traditional intervention techniques that focus on education, contracts, social support and more frequent interaction with physicians are not effective when used alone. Successful strategies have been multidisciplinary"";"" and interventions by professional nurses who help patients understand their illness and disease process and help them develop their disease management and self-management skills. Therapeutic improvement includes Theory of Change Phases, Theory of Engagement, Motivational Interviewing techniques and tools specifically designed for process evaluation of health-promoting interventions. METHOD: This is a critical review of approaches that have not been synthesized in a single published article so far. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the commonly used Phases of Change model, therapeutic augmentation is beneficial for patients who are in the action phase of change. By using therapeutic reinforcement along with therapeutic strategies described in the Stages of Change Theory, such as emergency management, helping relationships, counterconditioning, stimulus control, and Motivational Interviewing techniques, nursing professionals can significantly increase the chances of patients moving from action to the maintenance stage of change. for a particular health behavior. RELATED TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Using the nursing intervention category, therapeutic reinforcement can increase caregiver success in helping patients maintain healthy behaviors.",0,0,
1870,Treatment and supportive care of alcoholics: guidelines for practitioners,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Alcoholism is a common disorder in our societies. However, only a small percentage of alcoholics appear in certain psychotherapeutic treatment programs. The vast majority are seen by general practitioners or other medical specialties, where they are treated extensively for their alcohol-related comorbidities. However, alcoholism itself, which is the cause of these comorbidities, is rarely treated. This article provides a guide for experts and non-experts on how to properly treat these patients and increase motivation to abstain in non-specific treatment programs. In addition, the concept can be quickly and easily integrated into the daily routine of any therapy team. METHODS: Literature on therapeutic modalities of brief interventions, motivational interviewing, and pharmacological relapse prevention was reviewed in PubMed for the years 1991-2005. CONCLUSION/CONCLUSION: The burden of alcoholism and alcohol abuse as primary disorders is quite significant, but is often underestimated, even by therapists from various medical disciplines. Systematic studies of the brief intervention method, motivational interviewing, as well as pharmacological treatment with acamprosate, have shown that these are powerful methods that can be easily used to increase the duration of abstinence and the motivation of patients to engage in further specific treatment.",0,0,

METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted for articles reporting the use of 3DUS or 4DUS in obstetrics. Seven hundred and six articles were identified, of which 525 were actually related to the topic of this review. Articles describing technical developments, clinical studies, reviews, editorials, and studies on fetal behavior or maternal-fetal attachment were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for the diagnosis of facial anomalies, particularly facial clefts. There is also evidence that 3DUS provides additional diagnostic information in neural tube defects and skeletal malformations. Large studies comparing 2DUS and 3DUS for the diagnosis of congenital anomalies have not yielded conclusive results. Preliminary evidence suggests that sonographic tomography can reduce the examination time of obstetric ultrasound examination with minimal impact on the visualization rates of anatomical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for diagnosing facial anomalies, evaluation of neural tube defects, and skeletal malformations. Additional research is needed to determine the clinical role of 3DUS and 4DUS in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and central nervous system anomalies. Future studies should determine whether the information contained in the volume dataset alone is sufficient to evaluate fetal biometric measurements and diagnose congenital anomalies.",0,0,

1875,Tics in the Pediatric Population: Pragmatic Management,"OBJECTIVE: Primary tic disorders, especially Tourette's syndrome, are very common movement disorders in childhood. However, the management of such patients still poses great therapeutic challenges for medical professionals. METHODS: Based on a synthesis of existing guidelines and newer therapeutic developments published in Europe, Canada, and the United States, the authors provide a pragmatic guide to assist clinicians in deciding when and how to treat patients with primary tic disorders. . RESULTS: After a systematic evaluation of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (primarily attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first step in treatment is comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families addressing the multifaceted phenomenology. tics and related behaviors, coping mechanisms, prognosis and treatment options. Hierarchical assessment of treatment goals (ie, tics versus comorbid behavioral symptoms) is crucial when more active intervention beyond careful monitoring is indicated. Behavioral treatments for tics are limited to older children and are not readily available in all centers, particularly due to the scarcity of well-trained therapists. Antipsychotics for tics, stimulants for ADHD, and pharmacological treatments such as atomoxetine and alpha2A-agonists for children with tics plus ADHD represent widely available and effective treatment options, but safety monitoring must be provided. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches as well as neuromodulation strategies have not been adequately explored in this patient population. CONCLUSION: The treatment of children with tics and Tourette's syndrome is multifaceted. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology and pediatrics can help meet the complex needs of these children.",0,0,
1876,"Tobacco brief intervention training for chiropractic, acupuncture and massage practitioners: CAM access study protocol","BACKGROUND: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Effective tobacco cessation aids are widely available but underused. Tobacco cessation brief interventions (BIs) increase quit rates. However, BI training has focused on traditional medicine providers, ignoring other health practitioners who have regular contact with tobacco users. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey found that approximately 20% of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users were tobacco users. Thus, TAT practitioners represent a large, untapped community resource for potentially promoting tobacco cessation and the use of effective quit aids. Current BI training is not well suited to the background and practice patterns of CAM practitioners, as it assumes a traditional foundation of biomedical knowledge and philosophical approaches to health, healing, and the patient-practitioner relationship. There is an urgent need to develop and test the effectiveness of BI training that is both based on Public Health Service (PHS) Guidelines for tobacco addiction treatment and is relevant and appropriate for CAM practitioners. METHODS/DESIGN: The CAM Reach (CAMR) intervention is a tobacco cessation BI education and office system intervention tailored specifically for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists. The CAMR study uses a one-group one-way crossover design to examine the impact of CAMR intervention on tobacco-related practice behaviors of CAM practitioners. Primary outcomes included CAM practitioners' self-reported tobacco use screening and BIs. Secondary outcomes include tobacco smoking patients' readiness to quit, attempts to quit, use of guideline-based treatments, and quit rates, as well as actions by non-smokers to help someone else quit. DISCUSSION: CAM practitioners care for a significant number of tobacco users. Practice patterns and philosophical approaches to health and healing are well suited to providing BIs. The CAMR study examines the impact of the CAMR intervention on practitioners' tobacco-related practice behaviors, CAM patient behaviors, and documents the factors that are important for conducting practice-based research in real-world CAM applications.",0,0,
1877,Tobacco cessation in primary care: maximizing intervention strategies,"The most effective preventive intervention a clinician can provide to patients who use tobacco against heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an empathetic, personalized smoking cessation intervention program with extended assistance and follow-up. The goal of the intervention should be to quit smoking completely. Reduction does not provide direct health benefits to the individual smoker. Interventions are readily available but underused, in part due to a lack of clinician training and institutional support. This article summarizes current guidelines for smoking cessation interventions as a framework to get started. The guidelines include the Transtheoretical Model of patient behavior change and the ""Five A's"": Ask, Advise, Evaluate, Help, and Edit. Pharmacotherapeutic tools are being evaluated, including nicotine replacement therapies (nicotine gums, patches, nasal sprays, inhalers, and novel therapies) and non-nicotine therapies (bupropion, clonidine, nortriptyline, and other antidepressants and anxiolytics). Compliance verification methods, new approaches to tobacco and addiction treatment that have emerged in the recent research literature are reviewed. Beyond this framework, specific consideration should be given to certain tobacco users (including smokeless tobacco users), cultural and ethnic minorities, adolescents who use snuff and bidis, women, Medicaid recipients and users of multiple types of tobacco. With this framework and the modifications that may be necessary for certain patient categories, practicing clinicians can incorporate a successful tobacco cessation intervention program into daily practice with quit rates approaching 20%.",0,0,

1879,Tobacco Cessation Education for Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practitioners: Results of a Practice-Based Trial,"INTRODUCTION: Brief behavioral intervention (BI) is a well-known tobacco cessation best practice among traditional health practitioners. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners treat a significant number of tobacco users, but do not systematically receive BI training. The CAM Reach study developed and evaluated a tobacco cessation BI training program/practice system intervention specifically tailored for CAM practitioners and evaluated in real-world CAM applications. STUDY DESIGN: Single arm response. Data were collected in 2010-2014 and analyzed in 2015. SETUP/PARTICIPANTS: Private practices of 30 chiropractors, 27 acupuncturists, 42 massage therapists (N=99) in Tucson, Arizona. INTERVENTION: Eight hour tobacco cessation BI continuing education workshop, in-office BI skills implementation/assessment, and systems intervention. Tailored to the TAT practice environment, the training addressed tobacco cessation best practices in the US Public Health Service Guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seventeen items (which assess the practitioner's behavior, motivation, and self-efficacy with tobacco cessation) consisting of three factors: Tobacco Cessation Effectiveness, Tobacco Cessation Motivation, and Out-of-Glass Comfort were evaluated at baseline, and 3, 6, from training according to the Practitioner's self-report. 9 and 12 months later. Research staff visited practices at approximately the same intervals to directly observe changes in clinical practice systems. RESULTS: At 3 months, there were significant increases in practitioners' tobacco cessation activities, motivation and confidence in helping patients quit, and comfort in providing information and guidance for guideline-based tobacco cessation aids (p<0.0001). Practitioners significantly increased the rates of discussing cessation medications with patients (AOR=3.76, 95% CI=1.84, 7.68) and routinely asking questions about tobacco use in clinical practice (AOR=2.62, 95% CI=1.11, 6.20). Increases occurred in all three types of practitioners and continued at 12 months despite heterogeneity in vocational training, practice models/organization, and practice business models.

1880,Tobacco addiction treatment guidelines,"Tobacco addiction causes one in six deaths in the Czech Republic and is associated with whole-body diseases. Treatment of tobacco addiction should be a standard part of clinical care in the current timeline, from brief intervention to intensive treatment at each clinical contact with patients. It includes psycho-socio-behavioral support and pharmacotherapy. It should apply to all professions in clinical medicine, as recommended by WHO, in particular doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists, and should be covered by health systems. Economically, it is one of the most cost-effective interventions in medicine.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has published a practice guide on best practices to encourage all healthcare providers to respond to tobacco addicts they encounter. Psychologists may be ideal for implementing brief tobacco interventions because of their expertise in behavior modification strategies and interpersonal counseling skills. This study aimed to explore current tobacco assessment and intervention practices and perceptions of responsibility for tobacco intervention in a regional sample of licensed practicing psychologists. The results show that the majority of psychologists lag far behind the ideal best practices recommended in the practice guide, and many are unaware of the availability of the guidelines.

1882,Tobacco use in individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: epidemiology and pharmacological approaches to quitting,"Co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine addiction is common. Individuals with ADHD are more likely to start smoking and become addicted to nicotine than those without ADHD, and recent evidence suggests that they may have more difficulty quitting smoking. Little is known about how best to approach the treatment of these comorbidities to optimize clinical outcome. Clinicians treating individuals with ADHD or nicotine addiction should be aware of their common occurrence and the need to address both in treatment. This review of ADHD and nicotine addiction provides an overview of the relevant epidemiology, bidirectional interactions, and implications for pharmacological and adjunctive psychosocial therapy. Combining the existing evidence base and clinical experience, the authors propose a stepwise approach to treating patients with comorbid ADHD and nicotine addiction. Given the potential for ADHD symptoms to interfere with smoking cessation success, the first priority is to stabilize ADHD. The first-line pharmacological approach should be a long-acting psychostimulant. Upon ADHD stabilization, motivational techniques should be used to promote readiness for a smoking cessation attempt. Within the scope of behavioral cessation interventions sensitive to the patient's needs and developmental stage, pharmacological intervention for smoking cessation can be initiated. The authors recommend varenicline as a first-line agent, given the superior effect size among current drug therapies. Nicotine withdrawal and craving symptoms, as well as ADHD symptoms, should be closely monitored during an attempt to quit and, if necessary, adjustments in treatment considered. The authors concluded that while current treatments may be potentially effective for comorbid ADHD and nicotine addiction, more research is needed to debunk the complex relationships between these disorders and to prospectively examine combined treatments.",0,0,

Methods: Eight bibliographic database searches for peer-reviewed publications in English from January 2006 to March 2015. Studies were included if they met the a priori inclusion criteria of: 1) quantitative study design and 2) focus tobacco-nicotine education or training for HCP students and practitioners. All studies were independently screened by two reviewers for inclusion. Data from the included studies were extracted for study characteristics and key conclusions, and then critically evaluated for methodological quality. Results: 59 studies were included for narrative synthesis. Two categories emerged: 1) curriculum features (n=10) and 2) education and training interventions (n=49). The curricular studies included identified the following themes: content, intensity, assessment of competences and barriers. Study findings on education and training interventions were grouped by education level (pre-graduate, post-graduate, and faculty education), teaching method, health discipline, and relevant HCP and client outcomes. Conclusion: This comprehensive review shows a lack of consistency in HCP tobacco-nicotine education and training specifications. This article provides a valuable categorization of the most commonly used components of the academic curriculum and discusses interventions related to HCP and client outcomes.

However, researchers and practice stakeholders are unlikely to use the measures if they are not pragmatic at the same time. The aim of this study was to create a stakeholder-oriented conceptualization of the areas that make up the pragmatic measure structure. It was built on a systematic review of the literature and semi-structured stakeholder interviews that established 47 criteria for pragmatic measures, and aimed to further refine this set of criteria by defining conceptually different categories of the pragmatic measurement structure and providing quantitative ratings of the criteria. ¯ clarity and importance. Methods Twenty-four stakeholders with expertise in implementation practice completed a concept mapping activity where they conceptually organized the initial list of 47 criteria into different categories and rated their clarity and importance. Multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results The 47 criteria were grouped into four different categories: (1) acceptable, (2) compatible, (3) easy, and (4) useful. Average degrees of clarity and importance will be presented at the level of category and individual criteria. Conclusions This study advances the field of applied science and practice by providing clear and conceptually diverse areas of the pragmatic measure construct. Next steps will include a Delphi process to develop consensus on the most important criteria and the development of measurable pragmatic rating criteria that can be used to evaluate metrics.",0,0,
1888,Towards Evidence-Based Medical Statistics. 1: P Value Misconception,"There is a major problem in interpreting modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in interpreting quantitative results. This phenomenon manifests itself in the discussion sections of research articles and can ultimately affect the reliability of the results. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that results can be produced with certain ""error rates"" without considering information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, whose core components are P-values and hypothesis testing, is widely perceived as a mathematically consistent approach to inference. There is little recognition in the medical community that the methodology is a mixture of discordant elements, the utility of which for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of this discussion and traces the appeal and negative impact of this methodology to the P-value fallacy, the misconception that a single number can capture both the long-term results and evidential meaning of an experiment. a single result. This argument was made as an introduction to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used - the Bayes factor, which appropriately separates long-term behavioral issues from evidential power and allows background information to be integrated with statistical findings.",0,0,

This limits the execution of evidence syntheses, hinders communication and collaboration, and undermines knowledge translation of research findings in a variety of settings. Improving the uniformity of terminology can help address these challenges. In 2012, we convened an international working group to explore the idea of developing a common terminology and an overarching framework for information translation interventions. Findings Methods included describing and summarizing existing frameworks, assembling a subset of these frameworks, and bringing together a multidisciplinary group to begin work towards consensus. The group evaluated four potential approaches to creating a simplified framework: combining existing classifications, creating a framework of intervention mechanisms rather than intervention strategies, using a consensus process to expand one of the existing models/frameworks used by the group, or developing a new consensus framework. Conclusions The working group chose to design a new, simplified consensus intervention framework to integrate and support evidence into health practices, systems and policies. The framework will include four key components: strategies and techniques (active components), how they work (causal mechanisms), how they are delivered (delivery mode), and what they aim to change (intended objectives). The draft framework needs to be further developed through feedback and consultation with the research community and tested for its usefulness through implementation and evaluation.",0,0,

1891,Tracheostomy and weaning,"No hypothesis regarding respiratory care in the ICU has been more difficult to examine objectively than the popular belief that tracheostomy accelerates weaning from respiratory support. Tracheostomy may facilitate weaning by reducing dead space and reducing airway resistance, improving secretion clearance, reducing the need for sedation, and reducing the risk of aspiration. Current evidence suggests that dead space and airway resistance are actually reduced, but whether the magnitude of these reductions explains the clinical observation of faster weaning after tracheotomy is less certain. Most of the data on this topic comes from laboratory experiments and short-term physiological studies in clinically stable patients, and the available evidence from clinical studies using weaning as the primary endpoint is insufficient. A large multicenter study showed no advantage of early tracheotomy, but showed how difficult it is to get clinicians to manage their patients with regimens that contradict their strongly advocated views. The most recent clinical study found that percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy performed in the first 2 days in patients predicted to need ventilatory support for more than 14 days greatly reduced ventilator and ICU days and reduced both the incidence of pneumonia and overall mortality. Tracheostomy was performed after the 14th day. Conducting such trials is difficult due to investigative and clinician bias, the inability to predict which patients will actually need prolonged mechanical ventilation, and several other factors discussed in this article. Tracheotomy probably helps to relieve some patients from respiratory support, but this may be from any physiological effects as well as from its impact on clinician behavior.",0,0,

Objectives To explore the concept of patient safety and how it relates to the safety and quality frameworks commonly used in healthcare, and to monitor the evolution of the ICPS framework based on electronic capture of the component elements of patient safety. Conclusion The ICPS conceptual framework for patient safety has its origins in existing frameworks and an international consultation process. Although the class 10 and its semantic relationships can be used as reference models for different disciplines, it must remain dynamic in the ever-changing world of healthcare. A progressively deeper interdisciplinary approach will be developed to address the complex, resilient problem of reducing harm associated with healthcare, by examining data from all available sources and expanding the ICPS with tight compliance with the latest informatics principles.",0,0,
1893,Training GPs on opioid prescribing for chronic pain based on practice guidelines: a randomized pilot and feasibility study.,"UNLABELED: This study is a pilot and feasibility study comparing 2 training experiences to develop appropriate opioid prescription for chronic pain. Both training conditions included training on opioid guidelines. Following the training, 1 condition included training to develop psychological flexibility and the other included training in practical knowledge and skills related to pain management. Eighty-one general practitioners (GPs) participated in the study and each was randomly assigned to one of the training conditions. Training GPs has been easy. Overall, GPs demonstrated increased knowledge of opioid prescribing for chronic pain and decreased concerns about prescribing after training. However, no changes in reported prescribing practices or secondary well-being measures were observed. There were also no significant differences between the training conditions, except for a greater increase in intention to use prescribing guidelines in the psychological flexibility condition. The applicability and acceptability of the training methods were generally evaluated as high. The psychological flexibility condition scored higher than the comparison condition in terms of interest and satisfaction. Finally, pre- and post-training psychological resilience processes are significantly associated with measures of GP well-being and provide partial support for the relevance of these processes as a focus in GP training. PERSPECTIVE: An education intervention for GPs, including opioid guidelines for chronic pain and psychological resilience training, increased prescribing knowledge and reduced anxiety, but did not change prescribing behavior or well-being. The training was quite acceptable to GPs but may have been too short to have any other effects.",0,0,

1897,Training practitioners to provide opportunistic multiple behavior change counseling in primary care: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of primary care professionals' training in behavior change counseling on the proportion of patients reporting changes in four risky behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, exercise, and healthy eating). DESIGN Cluster randomized trial with general applications as the unit of randomization. SETTING General applications in Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 53 GPs and GP nurses (each but one) from 27 general practitioners recruited 1827 patients who screened positive for at least one risky behavior. INTERVENTION Behavior change counseling was developed from motivational interviewing to enable clinicians to increase their motivation to change patients' health-related behaviors. Clinicians were trained using a blended learning program called Talking Lifestyles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportion of patients reporting beneficial changes in at least one of four risk behaviors at three months. RESULTS 1308 patients from 13 interventions and 1496 patients from 14 control treatments were approached: 76% and 72%, respectively, agreed to participate with 831 (84%) and 996 (92%) eligible screenings for an intervention. Primary outcome (beneficial change in behavior) at 3 months (362 (44%) v 404 (41%), odds ratio 1.12 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.39) had no effect on biochemical or biometric measures at 12 months. more patients consulted, a health behavior (724/795 (91%) v 531/966 (55%), odds ratio 12.44 (5.85 to 26.46)) and intended to change (599/831 ( 72%) v 491/996 ( 49%), odds 2.88 (2.05 to 4.05). More intervention practice patients attempted to change (328 (39%) v 317 (32%), odds ratio 1.40 (1.15 to 1.70) ), reported a persistent behavioral change at three months (288 (35%) v 280 (28) %), odds ratio 1.36 (1.11 to 1.65)), and slightly greater improvement in healthy eating at three and 12 months and also reported improved activity at 12 months. The training cost is £1597 per app. DISCUSSION Training primary care clinicians using a short blended learning program in behavior change counseling did not improve patients' reporting of beneficial behavior change at three months or a biometric and biochemical measure at 12 months, but increased patients' recall that they discussed behavior change with them. clinicians, intentions to change, attempts to change, and perceptions of making a permanent change in three months.

However, very few have undergone formal impact analysis, which is the standard of evidence to assess their impact on patient care. Without impact analysis, clinicians do not know whether using a prediction rule would be beneficial or harmful. This article reviews standards of evidence for developing and evaluating prediction rules""; key differences between prediction rules and decision rules; how to evaluate the potential clinical impact of a prediction rule before it is translated into a decision rule; methodological issues critical to successful effect analysis, definition of outcome measures and estimating sample size; the importance of close collaboration between clinical investigators and practicing clinicians before, during and after impact analysis; and the need to measure both efficacy and effectiveness when analyzing the clinical impact of a decision rule. should inform its future development, evaluation and use.",0,1,
1901,Translating evidence-based fall prevention into clinical practice in nursing facilities: results and lessons from a quality improvement collaboration,"OBJECTIVES: To describe changes in the care process before and after a collaborative evidence-based decline reduction quality improvement in nursing facilities. DESIGN: Natural experiment in which non-participating facilities act as a control. SETTING: Community nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: 36 participant and 353 non-participant nursing facilities in North Carolina. INTERVENTION: Two face-to-face learning sessions, monthly teleconferences and an email discussion list for 9 months. The amendment package emphasized screening, labeling and risk factor reduction. MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured before and after the intervention using the facility's own report and chart abstraction (n = 832). Rates of decline measured using the Minimum Dataset (MDS) were compared with those of non-participating facilities as a result of an exploration. RESULTS: Self-reported agreement on screening, labeling and risk factor reduction approached 100%. Graphic abstraction, screening (51% vs 68%, P < .05), risk factor reduction (4% vs 7%, P = .30), and drug evaluation (2% vs 6%, P = .34). There was a significant increase in vitamin D prescriptions (40% to 48%, P=.03) and a decrease in sedative-hypnotics (19% to 12%, P=.04), but no change in benzodiazepine, neuroleptic, or calcium use. Chart abstraction (28.6% vs 37.5%, P = .17), MDS (18.2% vs 15.4%, P = .56), or self-report (6.1-5.6 drops/1,000 bed days, P = .31). CONCLUSION: While multiple risk factor reduction tasks are rarely implemented, scanning tasks seem more easily interchangeable in a real-world setting. Significant differences between self-reported practice and medical record documents require the use of additional data sources to evaluate processes of change in care resulting from quality improvement programs. Interventions to improve interdisciplinary cooperation should be developed.",0,0,
1902,Turning guidelines into practice: findings from a multidisciplinary preventive cardiology program in the west of Ireland,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this observational, descriptive study was to evaluate the impact of an intensive, evidence-based preventive cardiology program on medical and lifestyle risk factors in patients at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Patients at increased CVD risk and their family members/partners were invited to participate in a 16-week program of professional multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention with appropriate risk factor and therapeutic management in a community setting. Smoking, dietary habits, physical activity levels, waist circumference and body mass index, and medical risk factors were measured at the initial assessment, at the end of the program, and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Adherence to the program was high, with 375 (87.2%) participants and 181 (84.6%) partners completing the program, 1-year data were obtained from 235 (93.6%) patients and 107 (90.7%) partners. There were statistically significant improvements in both lifestyle (body mass index, waist circumference, physical activity, Mediterranean diet score, fish, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking cessation rates), and psychosocial (anxiety and depression scales and quality of life indices). Medical risk factors (blood pressure, lipid, and glycemic targets) between baseline and end of program and these improvements are maintained at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate how a holistic model of CVD prevention can improve cardiovascular risk factors by providing healthier lifestyles and optimal medical management.",0,0,
1903,Translation of alcohol screening and brief intervention guidelines to pediatric trauma centers,"BACKGROUND: As part of the American College of Surgeons' verification to become a Level 1 trauma center, centers must have the capacity to identify and respond to trauma patients with risky alcohol use. Despite the supporting scientific evidence and national policy statements promoting alcohol Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), barriers still exist that hinder the integration of SBIRT into clinical care. The study objectives of this multisite translational research study were to identify best practices for integrating SBIRT services into routine care for pediatric trauma patients, to quantify changes in practice through the adoption and implementation of an SBIRT policy, and SBIRT services in pediatric trauma centers. METHODS: This translational research study was conducted at seven US pediatric trauma centers over a 3-year period. Changes in SBIRT practice were measured through self-report and medical record review at three different study phases: adoption, implementation, and maintenance. RESULTS: Based on medical record review, at baseline, 11% of eligible patients were screened and had a brief intervention (if needed) at all facilities. After completion of SBIRT technical assistance activities, all seven participating trauma centers effectively developed, adopted and implemented SBIRT policies for injured adolescent inpatients. Additionally, across all facilities, 73% of eligible patients received SBIRT services after both the implementation and care phases. Opportunities and barriers to successful integration have been identified. CONCLUSION: This model can serve as a method for implementing SBIRT services in pediatric trauma centers.",0,0,

We have developed a technique for translating a comprehensive set of eligibility criteria into a usable set of practice guidelines. The criteria are derived from a formal consensus process conducted by RAND and relate to indications for coronary artery bypass grafting in acute myocardial infarction. Clinical indications defined by the expert panel are entered as conditions in a decision table. The recommended action for each combination of relevant clinical findings is defined from the median ranking of the Rand panel. The fully constructed table is then compressed using traditional decision table techniques and sorted to facilitate parsing of the information. All in all, 8 narrative expressions were derived from 51 rules. Augmented decision tables allow detailed data to be viewed in the pivot table and accessed as needed.",0,1,

DESIGN AND EXAMPLE: This qualitative study was conducted with 10 healthcare organizations participating in voluntary, interprofessional obesity management collaborations. A purposive sample of 39 participants included two to three clinicians and an administrator from each institution. Interview analysis focused on how the intervention affected the participants and their practices. RESULTS: The four themes that defined the participants' experiences with obesity guideline translation: (1) the shift from powerlessness to positive motivation, (2) increased awareness with increased responsiveness, (3) personal ownership and use of creativity, and (4) increased sense of the importance of interprofessional collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Exploring interprofessional perspectives illuminates the clinician and manager participants' feelings and perceptions regarding obesity practice guideline translation. These themes suggest that positive motivation, enhanced capacity, personal creative ownership, and interprofessional collaboration can aid successful evidence-based obesity guideline implementation. More research is needed to evaluate these findings with regard to translating the ICSI obesity guideline and other guidelines into practice in a variety of clinical settings.",0,0,

1907,Trend trap for statistical significance: probability of near-significant P value becoming more significant with extra data,"When faced with a P-value (usually P<0.05) that fails to reach a certain threshold, authors of scientific papers may imply a ""trend"" towards statistical significance or otherwise suggest failure to fail. This was due to insufficient data to achieve statistical significance. This article provides a quantitative analysis to show that such disclosures give a misleading impression and undermine the principle of correct reporting. P values that do not reach the traditional significance level of Pâ€°Â¤0.05 are reported regularly as if they were moving in that direction. Phrases like ""almost/approaching statistical significance"" or, most obviously, a ""trend"" toward ""statistical significance"" continue to find their way into articles. journals with high impact factors.1 In this article, we examine the mathematical basis for this assumption and evaluate the extent to which a near-significant P-value can predict future movement towards a significant P-value by adding extra data. We also explore the probability that the extra data will result in a truly significant result, and finally, the confidence that a repeated experiment will independently yield statistically significant results. The most obvious context in which to consider the correct interpretation of a P-value is a randomized trial. Fisher explained how “the simple randomization measure would be sufficient to ensure the validity of the significance test. it tells how much it can explain the difference and acts as a “snapshot” measure of the strength of the evidence at the end of the trial. As the evidence accumulates, the conclusions become more well-founded. The AP value can be easily imagined as follows:",0,0,

1909,"HIV ""medical home"" depression treatment: a guided algorithm for antidepressant management by HIV clinicians.","People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) suffer from an increased prevalence of depression compared to the general population, negatively impacting antiretroviral (ART) adherence and HIV-related outcomes leading to morbidity and mortality. Yet depression in this population is often undiagnosed and untreated. The current project aimed to design an evidence-based approach to integrate depression care into HIV clinics. The model chosen, measure-based care (MBC), is based on current guidelines and the largest randomized trial of depression treatment. The MBC was adapted to the clinical realities of HIV care for use in a randomized controlled efficacy trial of depression management at three academic HIV clinics. Adaptation takes into account drug-drug interactions critical to continued ART efficacy and can be achieved by a multidisciplinary non-mental health team. A treatment algorithm has been developed that enables clinically supervised, non-physician depression care managers (DCMs) to monitor and monitor antidepressant tolerability and treatment response, while supporting non-psychiatry prescribers with antidepressant selection and dosage. Quality of care is ensured by weekly supervision of DCMs by psychiatrists. Key areas of flexibility that were important in practice included flexibility in the timing of assessments, regulating differences between algorithm recommendations and provider decisions, and regulating delays in the implementation of treatment plans. This adaptation of the MBC model to HIV care has elucidated critical antidepressant-antiretroviral interactions and facilitated the delivery of quality antidepressant management in the HIV medical home.",0,0,

METHODS: One hundred and eleven obese (37.0+/-5.8 kg/m(2)) middle-aged (45.5+/-10.8 years) adults (62% women) were randomly assigned to a usual care or trial (SMART: self-monitoring) and resting metabolic rate technology) group. The usual care group received a standard feeding schedule in accordance with national guidelines. All participants received a comprehensive weight management program consisting of motivational interviewing (MI) sessions and automated email behavioral newsletters. Body weight, arterial blood pressure, and psycho-behavioral structures were evaluated over 12 weeks. RESULTS: Supplementary analysis (n=80) showed significant improvement in body weight (-3.9%), systolic arterial pressure (-4 mmHg), and all motivational constructs (p<or=.05) after 12 weeks of study. However, there was no significant difference between groups at any time period. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, a comprehensive 12-week weight reduction program of MI and automated email behavioral newsletters with or without SMART is effective in treating obese adults.

Psychological treatment is effective but time consuming and there are waiting lists for secondary care. Therefore, there has been increased interest in the development of treatment guidelines that can be applied in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and feasibility of guided self-help, Dutch College of General Practitioners' Anxiety Disorder Principles and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). STUDY DESIGN: 12-week randomized controlled trial for primary care patients with panic disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder, with follow-ups of 3 and 9 months. SETTING: The first two treatment modalities were administered by 46 GPs randomly assigned to a form. CBT was administered by cognitive behavioral therapists in a psychiatry outpatient clinic. METHODS: Participants (n = 154) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities. The main outcome measure used was the status subscale of the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS: All three treatment modalities showed a significant improvement between pretest and posttest, and this improvement remained stable between posttest and follow-up. Results with the three treatment forms did not differ significantly over time. The applicability of the Anxiety Disorder Guidelines was low compared with guided self-help. CONCLUSION: Our results show that primary care patients with generalized anxiety disorder who do not see referral to the GP as necessary can be adequately treated by the GP. Referral to the psychiatry outpatient clinic does not yield superior results. Guided self-help is easier for the GP than a less structured treatment as outlined in the Anxiety Disorder Guidelines.",0,0,

Exploring and reinterpreting memories of early childhood experiences that are presumed to contribute to pathogenesis is increasingly seen as a promising way to change core schemas. Experimental methods seem to be the most effective. This article discusses two main forms of these methods: (i) descriptive imagery and (ii) both role-playing childhood interactions with key figures. Protocols for both are provided as a guide for clinicians and to encourage standardization so that this new field can be opened up to experimental research.

1914,Treating common 'life event' traumas,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners are confronted every day with patients who experience distressing 'life events'. Assisting patients in this process can be a significant challenge. OBJECTIVE: This article points to the reactive symptomatology and subsequent reactions that are evident or hidden in a stressful event, sets the goal of restoring one's functionality and self-resources, and gives guidelines on what counseling can do for a patient. DISCUSSION: Individuals coping with a distressing 'life event' or trauma can be effectively assisted with early short-term counseling. While this task may not appeal to the busy GP, many accessible interventions can restore a person's coping capacity and prevent the possibility of an ongoing and deepening pathology. Many symptoms do not fit into the diagnostic categories often associated with stress disorders. Some may show impaired social participation and social phobia"";"" others may identify low self-worth, ill-health states, relationship dissatisfaction, and mismatches in core behavioral domains.

1917,Treatment services for children with ADHD: a national perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize information on treatment services for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), trends in services from 1989 to 1996, types of services provided, mix of services, and barriers to care. METHODS: A review of the literature and analyzes from 2 national physician practice questionnaires are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Major changes have occurred in stimulant prescriptions since 1989, with prescriptions now accounting for three-quarters of all doctor visits by children with ADHD. Between 1989 and 1996, related services such as health counseling for children with ADHD increased 10 times and diagnostic services tripled. However, the provision of psychotherapy decreased from 40% to only 25% of pediatric visits over the same time period. Follow-up care also dropped from over 90% of visits to just 75%. Family practitioners were less likely to prescribe stimulants and use diagnostic services, provide mental health counseling, or offer follow-up care than pediatricians or psychiatrists. About 50% of children with ADHD seen in real-world practice settings receive care that corresponds to the guidelines of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Doctors reported significant barriers to service delivery for these children, including a lack of pediatricians, insurance barriers, and long waiting lists. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in treatment services and physician differences in service delivery point to large gaps between research base and clinical practice. Clinical differences may reflect differences in education, inequality in the availability of specialists and the location of services, and changes in health care incentives.",0,0,

1919,Triggering anti-smoking advice by GPs: how an intervention promotes GPs smoking cessation advice works,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mode of action of an intervention (GP desktop resource, GDR) that increases the frequency of GP recommendations for smoking cessation. METHODS: Analyzes were made to distinguish between three hypotheses regarding the course of action of the GDR. By: (1) changing the attitudes of GPs, (2) regardless of their attitudes in encouraging GPs to intervene with smokers, or (3) changing the relationship between attitude and behavior. RESULTS: GDR was an independent indicator of the number of patients recommended to quit smoking (beta = .345, p < .001). Concern about the doctor-patient relationship was the only attitude variable that negatively predicted independent advice in this situation (beta = -.465, p < .001). Having a GDR did not change GPs' views on whether intervention with smokers harmed the doctor-patient relationship, but weakened the association between this attitude item and the number of patients advised to quit smoking (beta = .595, p < .001 for interaction). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show that concern about the doctor-patient relationship is an independent predictor of giving advice, but in other studies this has been noted as something that only GPs voiced concerns. A simple device designed by GPs to trigger action seemed to work by mitigating the negative impact of a behavioral action barrier. It would be interesting to explore this phenomenon more generally in relation to the health promotion activities of health professionals. PRACTICE PRACTICES: Recommendations for GPs to engage in health promotion activities with their patients should take into account that GPs' concerns about damaging the doctor-patient relationship may deter them from taking such interventions. The GDR appears to be effective in getting GPs to advise their smokers to quit smoking, and its widespread distribution to GPs should be considered.",0,0,
1920,Tumor boards: optimizing the structure and increasing efficiency of the multidisciplinary management of cancer patients worldwide,"Multidisciplinary management tumor boards are now run worldwide for the management of patients with cancer. Studies evaluating its effects on decision making and patient outcomes are limited"";"" however, single-center studies have reported significant changes in diagnosis and treatment plans. A survey from Arab countries showed that tumor boards are widely used and relied upon for decision making. A recent multi-institutional study of veterans employment (VA) hospitals in the United States found limited association between the presence of tumor boards and care and outcomes. The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium looked at the relationship between tumor plaque characteristics and measures of quality of care. Overall survival outcomes among patients from these physicians who attend tumor boards remain, but this article summarizes preliminary results, along with a recent ASCO study among international members, on the existence, use, and impact of tumor boards. Tumor boards allow for the application of clinical practice guidelines and can help capture cases for clinical trials. Efforts to improve the preparation, structure and functioning of tumor boards, research methods to monitor their performance, teamwork and results are also summarized in this article. The concept of mini-tumor boards and more efficient methods for MDM in countries with limited resources are also discussed. In suboptimal settings such as small community hospitals, rural areas, and areas with limited resources, the limits in diagnosis and management can be overcome or at least improved with tumor boards, especially with the use of videoconferencing facilities. Research from the UK has shown that tailored training of multidisciplinary teams (MDT) leads to better team dynamics and communication, increased patient satisfaction and improved clinical outcomes. The weight of benefits versus time and effort spent improving efficiency, patient care, and better time management in the United States and the international oncology community is also reviewed in this article.",0,0,
1921,Turning knowledge into action at the point of care: the shared experience of nurses facilitating the implementation of evidence-based practice.,"BACKGROUND: Facilitation is considered a way to enable clinicians to put evidence into practice by solving problems and providing support. App development is a well-established movement in the UK involving the use of facilitators, but in Canada the role is broader. Few research has observed the facilitation process described by those experienced in guideline implementation in North America. OBJECTIVE: To identify the tacit knowledge about facilitation in the experiences of nurses putting the evidence into practice. METHODS: Twenty nurses from across Canada were consciously selected to participate in an interactive symposium on information translation to examine what worked and what didn't in applying the evidence. This study is an additional in-depth analysis of data collected at the symposium with a focus on facilitating as an intervention to increase evidence uptake. The critical incident technique was used to elicit examples to examine nurses' facilitation experiences. Participants shared their experiences with each other and completed the initial data analysis and coding collaboratively. The data were further analyzed thematically using the qualitative inductive approach of continuous comparison. RESULTS: A number of factors, at various levels, emerged related to the success and failure of participants' efforts to facilitate evidence-based practice. Successful implementation: (a) focus on a material issue, (b) relevant evidence, (c) developing strategic partnerships, (d) using multiple strategies to effect change, and (e) facilitating characteristics and approach. Negative factors affecting the process were: (a) poor participation or ownership, (b) resource gaps, (c) conflict, (d) contextual issues, and (e) lack of evaluation and sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Factors at the individual, environmental, organizational and cultural levels influence facilitating evidence-based practice in real situations at the point of care. With a better understanding of the factors that contribute to successful or unsuccessful facilitation, future research should focus on analyzing tailored facilitation interventions to address barriers and improve those that facilitate evidence retrieval.",0,0,

1925,Understanding and preventing recidivism among adults with psychotic disorders,"The high prevalence of adults with psychotic disorders in the criminal justice system has received much attention recently, but our understanding of this problem has been marked by divergent views. Mental health experts point to deinstitutionalization and our fragmented mental health system as the root causes. Criminologists minimize the role of mental illness and argue that people with and without mental illness are arrested for the same reasons. Meanwhile, practice guidelines offer clinicians little guidance on how to address the problem. Drawing on contemporary principles of crime prevention, as well as up-to-date information on psychotic disorders and their treatment, this article provides a conceptual framework for understanding and preventing recidivism. The framework highlights the importance of individual and service system risk variables and highlights the central role of treatment nonadherence as a mediator between modifiable risk variables and recidivism. Based on the conceptual framework described in this article, three essential interventions are offered to prevent recidivism among adults with psychotic disorders: competent care, access to services, and legal leverage. Research is needed to further define and test these intervention elements as foundations for future service delivery efforts.",0,0,

General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in diagnosing and managing dementia"", but gaps exist between recommended and current practice. The purpose of this study was to explore and theoretically explain the reported practice of general practitioners in diagnosing and treating dementia in terms, evidence-based Suggested explanations for practice that are consistent and inconsistent with guidelines METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs in Victoria, Australia. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) guided data collection and analysis. 13 factors that hinder and enable the implementation of the recommended behavior. Data content and thematic analyzed using a validated instrument. This article provides an in-depth description of the factors influencing two behaviors, such as assessing comorbid depression using a validated tool and conducting a formal cognitive assessment. Using a validated scale RESULTS: A total of 30 practitioners consulted with the physician. Evaluate co-occurring depression using an approved tool according to recommended guidelines. Barriers include the belief that depression can be adequately assessed using general clinical indicators and validated tools provide little additional information (the theoretical domain of 'beliefs about outcomes'); possibly due to limited education and self-confidence ('Skills'; 'Beliefs about abilities'); discomfort in using approved tools ('Emotion'); limited awareness of the need for a depression assessment and forgetting to do so ('Information'; 'Memory, attention and decision processes'). Most reported practice consistent with the recommendation to undertake a formal cognitive assessment using an approved scale. Key factors for this are being aware of the need to conduct a cognitive assessment ('Knowledge'); have the necessary skills and confidence ('Skills'; 'Beliefs about abilities');"" and have adequate time and resources ('Environmental context and resources'). identified key factors that could explain physicians' adoption of the dementia guidelines currently being evaluated in a cluster of randomized trials.",0,0,
1928,Understanding how evaluation of doctors produces its effects: a realistic review protocol,"INTRODUCTION: UK doctors are now required to participate in revalidation to maintain their license to practice. Valuation is an essential component of revalidation. However, objective evidence that assessment changes physicians' behavior and directly leads to improved patient care is limited. In particular, it is unclear how the evaluation process will change physicians' behavior and improve clinical performance. The purpose of this research is to understand how and why physician evaluation produces its effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Realistic review is a theory-based interpretive approach to the synthesis of evidence. It applies realistic research logic to produce a descriptive analysis of an intervention, such as what works for whom, under what circumstances, and in what ways. A theory of the evaluation program will be developed using a realistic review approach, consulting key stakeholders in the evaluation of physicians in expert panels (no ethical approval required), and reviewing the literature to identify relevant existing theories. The search strategy will have a number of stages, including a combination of: (1) electronic database search, eg EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ASSIA, (2) 'cited' article search, (3) citation search, (4) with authors communicate and (5) gray literature review. The search for evidence will be expanded and refocused over and over as the review progresses. Studies will be included based on their ability to provide data enabling program theory to be tested. Data extraction will be carried out in different review phases, for example note-taking and note-taking, consistent with the realistic approach. Evidence will be synthesized using realistic logic to challenge the ultimate program theory of the impact of assessment on physicians' performance. Synthesis results will be written according to RAMESES guidelines and distributed through peer-reviewed publication and presentations.

1929,Understanding the implementation processes of clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines in pediatric contexts: a study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Canada is among the most prosperous countries in the world, but the health and wellness outcomes for Canadian children are surprisingly poor. There is some evidence to suggest that these poor health outcomes are due in part to clinical practice variation, otherwise known as information translation (KT), which may be due in part to a failure to apply the best research evidence available in clinical practice. Surprisingly, clinical practice differences are common even for common acute pediatric conditions. Clinical practice variation results in unnecessary medical treatments, increased pain and increased healthcare costs. This study focuses on improving health outcomes for common pediatric acute health problems by evaluating strategies that improve KT and reduce clinical practice variation. DESIGN/METHODS: Using a multiple case study design, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected from four emergency departments in western Canada. Data sources will include: ""pre- and post-implementation focus group data from multidisciplinary healthcare professionals""; individual interviews with local champions, KT response providers, and unit/site leaders/managers; Alberta Context Tool (ACT) survey data; and aggregated patient outcome data. Qualitative and quantitative data will be systematically triangulated and matrices will be created to make cross-case comparisons. Based on cross-case comparisons, statements will be made about the success or failure of uptake of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and clinical pathways (CPs). will generate new insights into potential causal mechanisms and factors Future studies will monitor the impact of the administration of CPG/CPs on children's health outcomes and health care costs.",0,0,
1930,Understanding nonadherence to colorectal cancer screening: a case-control study nestled in a randomized trialÂ,"Background The main limit of colorectal cancer screening efficacy is generally low compliance. We examined the reasons for non-compliance with stool occult blood tests and the predictors of compliance in Lazio, Italy. Methods This is a case-control study built into a trial that tests the effect of test type and provider on colorectal cancer screening compliance. Non-conforming trial subjects were classified as cases, and compliant subjects were classified as controls. We sampled 600 cases and 600 controls matched by their general practitioners, half of whom were invited for screening at the hospital and the other half were invited directly to the GP's office. Subjects and controls answered the following questions: distance from testing provider, logistical issues, perceived risk of colorectal cancer, confidence in screening effectiveness, fear of results, family history of colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results Approximately 31% of cases did not receive the letter offering free screening and 17% of the sampled population had already been screened. The first reported reason for non-compliance was ""lack of time"" (30%)"";"" The main determinant of compliance was distance from test provider: odds ratio >30 minutes vs <15 minutes 0.3 (95% CI = 0.2 – 0.7). The odds for the lack of time were 0.16 (95% IC 0.1- 0.26). The effect was stronger if the provider was a hospital (0.03 95% CI = 0.01–0.1) rather than a general practitioner (0.3% 95% CI = 0.2-0.6). Twenty-two percent of the controls were accompanied by someone in the test. Conclusion To increase compliance, screening programs should include testing providers geographically close to the target population.",0,1,

Two datasets were collected via telephone interviews in June and October 2003. The interviewed physicians had positive opinions about the mobile system and started to use it frequently in their work. They showed very few negative experiences of using the Nokia Communicator. They chose to use mobile technology as a way to improve the dissemination of medical information. The main content of the system, Evidence-Based Medical Guidelines and Pharmaca Fennica (pharmacopeia), was crucial to the use of the system. Some differences in the behavior of doctors over time were also found. The implications for system improvement are discussed.",0,0,
1932,Understanding practice: factors influencing the management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department—a qualitative study using the Theoretical Domains Framework.,"OBJECTIVE: Mild traumatic brain injury is a frequent cause of admission to emergency services. Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines in this area, there are differences in practice. One of the aims of the Neurotrauma Evidence Translation program is to develop and evaluate a targeted, theory- and evidence-based intervention to improve the treatment of mild traumatic brain injury in Australian emergency departments. This study is the first step in the intervention development process and uses the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore the factors perceived to influence the uptake of four main evidence-based recommended practices to manage mild traumatic brain injury. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with emergency personnel in Victoria, Australia. The interview guide was developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework to explore current practice and identify factors perceived to affect practice. Two researchers coded the interview transcripts using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants (9 Managers, 20 doctors and 13 nurses) were interviewed over a seven-month period. The results showed that (i) prospective assessment of post-traumatic amnesia is influenced by: ""knowledge""; beliefs about outcomes; environmental context and resources; skills; social/professional role and identity; and beliefs about abilities; (ii) use to inform appropriate use of CT scanning The criteria or decision rules developed by the guideline were influenced by the following: knowledge; beliefs about outcomes; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision processes; beliefs about abilities; social influences; skills and behavioral regulation (iii) oral and written patient information about discharge provision was affected by: beliefs about outcomes; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision processes; social/professional role and identity; and knowledge; (iv) briefing practice, routine follow-up on discharge were affected by: environmental context and resources; social /professional role and identity; information corner; with results Relevant beliefs"" and motivation and goals. RESULTS: Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, factors thought to affect the management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department were determined.

1933,"Understanding the neurobiology, assessment and treatment of substances of abuse and addiction: a guide for the intensive care nurse.","What do I do as an intensive care nurse? Because nurses are trained in health promotion and also interact with patients, their families and communities, they have first-hand opportunities to play an active role in primary prevention practices. Assess community need, assess facility needs, and identify potential risk to prevent the first occurrence of substance abuse. Determine the size of the problem. Intervene early on youth and at-risk populations. Refer patients and their families to mental health professionals. Provide education to patients, families, communities. Implementing secondary prevention to reduce substance abuse incidents requires immediate action at the earliest moments to recognize a problem and refer patients to early intervention and rehabilitation. Screening your patients, providing short training and prompt referral constitute early intervention. To delay disease progression, implement tertiary prevention by providing education, counseling and support to victims in achieving and maintaining sobriety through medication adherence and rehabilitative group and counseling work. The purpose of intervention in the lives of substance abusers is to stop drug use, prevent relapse, and maintain recovery. After years of research, NIDA has identified 13 key principles for effective drug addiction treatment. 1. Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior. 2. No single treatment is suitable for everyone. 3. The treatment must be ready. 4. Effective treatment deals with multiple needs of the individual, not just drug use. 5. It is very important to stay in treatment for an adequate period of time. 6. Counseling—individual and/or group—and other behavioral therapies are the most common forms of drug addiction treatment. 7. Medication is an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. 8. The individual's treatment and service plan should be continually evaluated and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets their changing needs. 9. Many drug addicts also have other mental disorders that require treatment. 10. Medically assisted detoxification in the first phase of addiction treatment and alone does little to change long-term drug use. 11. Treatment does not have to be voluntary to be effective. 12. Medication use should be continuously monitored during treatment, as treatment delays may occur. 13. Treatment programs should assess patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases, and also provide targeted risk reduction counseling to help patients change or modify behaviors that put them at risk of contracting it. or the spread of infectious diseases. To truly impact this disease, improvement in identifying risk factors and early diagnosis and early intervention with children and adolescents is needed. The future of neuroscience is in objective brain scans and genetic testing. Of these approaches, more objective measures of addiction and addiction can be made using brain scans and genetic testing. These measures will potentially allow for the development of vaccines for certain drugs of abuse and addiction, as well as increasingly selective and effective pharmacological approaches to treatment and a new consensus on the standard of care for substance abuse.",0,0,
1934,Understanding the performance of community health volunteers involved in the delivery of health programs in underserved areas: a realistic synthesis,"Background Recruiting community health volunteers (CHVs) to support the delivery of health programs is an established approach in underserved areas and particularly where there are inequalities in health due to scarcity of trained human resources. However, there is little evidence of what works to improve CHVsÂ¡Â¯ performance. This review aimed to synthesize the available literature to explain why, how, and under what conditions intervention approaches to improve the performance of CHVs may be more successful. Methods We carried out a realistic synthesis. We identified candidate theories relevant to our review questions and then guided the selection, evaluation, and analysis of primary studies. Publications of interest from 2008 to 2012 were identified by a systematic search in PubMed and IDEAS databases. We found appropriate all study designs that examined various aspects of CHV performance in the context of formal organizational settings and excluded studies that did not explain the performance of CHVs either in the findings or in the discussion section. Data were organized by context, interventions, outcomes, and mechanisms to identify interactions between them. The synthesis of the data allowed us to identify explanatory patterns within or across studies. Results We identified broad intervention approaches within the 23 articles included in the review: positioning CHV in the community, establishing clear roles, providing skills-based and continuing education, incentives, supervision, and logistical support for deployment and implementation. The findings provided insight into which mechanisms (self-esteem, sense of duty, self-efficacy, sense of fair treatment) should be targeted when applying such approaches and which contextual factors (stable and supportive cultural, political and social context and intervention are closely related). . linked to local health services) creates optimal conditions for these mechanisms to occur and ultimately contributes to better performance of CHVs. Four main explanatory models around these mechanisms emerged as the basis for better performance.

1935,"Unemployment and death rate in Denmark, 1970-80","The relative death rate for the period 1970-80 was studied among Danish men and women who were unemployed and working on the day of the 1970 census. The population of the research consisted of the total workforce between the ages of 20-64 on November 9, 1970, that is, approximately 2 million workers and 22.000 unemployed. Relative mortality was analyzed with a multiplicative hazard regression model (as a natural extension of the standardized mortality rate) and a multiplicative regression model with extra Poisson variation. After adjusting for occupation, housing category, geographic region and marital status, a significantly increased mortality rate (40-50%) was found among the unemployed. An analysis of the five major causes of death showed increased rates of death from all causes, particularly suicide or accidents. In regions with relatively high local unemployment rates, the relative mortality rate among the unemployed was lower. The increased mortality rate among the unemployed has been interpreted as a result of increased sensitivity linked to the psychosocial stress of unemployment as well as health-related choice.",0,0,
1936,Unequal protection for patients' rights: the distinction between university and health ethics committees,"Despite the recommendations of the Cartwright Report, ethical review by health ethics committees continued in New Zealand without having to acknowledge the dual role of health practitioners as health practitioners investigating their own patients. On the other hand, universities define doctor/research-patient relationships as a relationship that can potentially lead to role conflict problems. This is due to the acknowledgment within the university sector that faculty/research-student relationships are full of such conflicts. Although similar unequal relationships appear to exist between health researchers and their patients, the patient/subjects do not receive the same levels of protection as students/subjects. In this paper, we argue that the difference between universities and health research is a result of the Operational Standard Guidelines for Ethics Committees failing to openly acknowledge the patient's vulnerability and conflict of interest in the dual roles of the health practitioner/researcher. We conclude the article recommending the Ministry of Health to rewrite the Operational Standard Rules for Ethics Committees, specifically section 26 of the Operational Standard Rules for Ethics Committees. We also identify the value of comparative ethical review, and the New Zealand Health Research Council's tripartite relationship with Australia's NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council) and Canada's CIHR (Canadian Health Research Institute) is a useful tool for such a process. We recommend it as a starting point.",0,0,
1937,Unhealthy drinking habits and the receipt of preventive medical services by older adults,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient use of preventive services among older adults. Unhealthy drinking can be a risk factor for not getting these services. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between unhealthy drinking and receiving recommended preventive services among older Medicare beneficiaries by applying the existing framework of alcohol consumption guidelines. DESIGN/METHODS: Data source is the nationally representative 2003 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The sample includes community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and over (N = 10,523) who receive a fee per service. Based on self-reported drinking, participants were categorized as nonsmokers, regular drinkers, exceeding monthly limits but not daily, or severe intermittent drinkers. Influenza vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, glaucoma screening and mammogram receipt were determined using questionnaire and demand data. Bivariate and logistic regression analyzes were performed. RESULTS: Overall, during the year, 70.3% had flu vaccination, 49% had glaucoma screening, 66.8% had pneumonia vaccination, and 56.2% of women had mammography for 2 years. In logistic regression, severe episodic drinking was associated with a lower likelihood of service enrollment compared to drinking within the guidelines: influenza vaccine (OR 0.75, CI 0.59-0.96), glaucoma screening (OR 0.74, CI 0.58-0.95), and pneumonia vaccine (OR 0.75, CI. 0.59-0.96). Nonsmokers were less likely to receive mammograms (OR 0.83, CI 0.69-1.00) compared with those who reported drinking within guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy episodic drinking is associated with less likelihood of receiving few preventative services. Practitioners should be encouraged to screen all seniors for alcohol intake and consider older people reporting heavy episodic drinking at higher risk for not receiving preventive services, in addition to appropriate intervention.",0,0,
1938,"Adverse effects of a computerized physician, nearly stop warning input to avoid a drug interaction: a randomized controlled trial.","Background The effectiveness of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems has been modest, in large part as clinicians override electronic alerts. METHODS A randomized clinical trial was conducted at 2 academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly “hard stop” CPOE prescribing warning aimed at reducing co-orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group that received a near-stop warning or a control group that received standard practice. The run time was from August 9, 2006 to February 13, 2007. Results The proportion of desired responses (ie, no reordering of the stimulus-triggering drug within 10 minutes of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard stop stimuli). 13.5% (20/148) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045-0.33) in the intervention group and control group. However, the study was terminated early due to 4 adverse outcomes identified among patients in the intervention. group: delay of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy in 2 patients and delay of warfarin therapy in the other 2 patients Results An electronic hard-stop alert as part of the inpatient CPOE system appeared to be extremely effective in changing the prescribing intervention, clinically significant in the 4 patients requiring emergency drug therapy resulted in treatment delays.These results demonstrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended outcomes of programmatic interventions aimed at improving prescribing habits.",0,1,
1939,Update on interventions focused on symptom clusters: what has been tried and what have we learned?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although clinicians and researchers have acknowledged clusters of symptoms, the focus has been on the relief of a single symptom. This review summarizes the recent literature on interventions focused on alleviating symptom clusters in patients with cancer. RECENT RESULTS: Twelve intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria were published in 2011-2012. The time frame was extended to 2009-2012, and 24 studies met the criteria: 18 in early-stage cancer and 6 in advanced-stage cancer patients. A variety of cognitive behavioral therapy, complementary therapy, and exercise interventions have shown positive results in alleviating various clusters of symptoms in various types of cancer. Most psychoeducational interventions using traditional formats or combined with automated clinician prompts have shown to be effective in reducing various clusters. Clusters including fatigue and anxiety or depression were reduced by exercise in early-stage patients and methylphenidate in advanced-stage patients. Current NIH R01-funded studies have confirmed trends in the types of interventions tested. SUMMARY: Few interventions have been tested and found to be effective in relieving specific clusters of symptoms in patients with early and advanced cancer. Future research needs to expand our understanding of the mechanisms that initiate co-occurring symptoms. Mechanism-targeted interventions need to be identified and tested in homogeneous samples with specific symptom clusters. Interventions need to be repeated before guidelines can be created.",0,0,
1940,Update on pediatric hyperlipidemia,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to review the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI) guidelines on the screening and management of hyperlipidemia in children and to discuss critical concerns about universal screening. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed positive trends in serum lipid levels among 6-19-year-old children and adolescents between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010. Mean total cholesterol (TC) decreased from 165 to 160 mg/dl and the prevalence of high TC decreased from 11.3% to 8.1%. However, between 2007 and 2010, approximately 20% of 9-11 year olds had either low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or high non-HDL cholesterol. This warrants additional evaluation according to NHBLI guidelines. SUMMARY: NHBLI guidelines offer physicians a balanced perspective for screening and managing hyperlipidemia in children. These guidelines provide a schematic approach to help primary care physicians make treatment decisions. The hope is that this will lead to reduced health system costs and overall improved health through early detection and intervention.",0,0,

One of ACHRE's key questions was to determine the role (if any) the Nuremberg Law plays in the norms and practice of US medical researchers. Based on the evidence from ACHRE's Ethics Oral History Project and extensive archival research, we conclude that the Code had little impact on mainstream medical researchers engaged in human subjects research at the time of publication.

1942,Use and impact of health information exchange: a systematic review.,"Background: Health information exchange (HIE) is on the rise in the United States and is encouraged by government policies. Objective: To systematically review and evaluate the evidence for the use and impact of HIE in clinical care. Data Sources: Selected databases from 1 January 2003 to 31 May 2014. Study Selection: English-language hypothesis testing or quantitative studies of various types of data exchanges between independent organizations for use in clinical care that address health outcomes, efficiency, utilization, costs, satisfaction, HIE use, sustainability, and attitudes or barriers. Data Extraction: Data extraction was done in duplicate. Data Synthesis: Low-quality evidence from 12 hypothesis-testing studies supports the impact of HIE use in the emergency room on reduced utilization or costs. Direct evidence of use of HIEs by providers was reported in 21 studies involving 13 different HIE organizations, 6 of which were located in New York, and generally showed use in less than 10% of patient encounters. Findings from 17 sustainability studies show that about a quarter of existing HIE organizations consider themselves financially stable. Findings from 38 studies on attitudes and barriers showed that providers, patients, and other stakeholders value HIE, but barriers include technical and workflow issues, costs, and privacy concerns. Limitation: Publication bias, possible selective reporting of results, and lack of reporting on context and implementation processes. Conclusion: The use of health information exchange probably reduces emergency room use and costs in some cases. Effects on other outcomes are unknown. All stakeholders claim to value HIE, but there are many barriers to acceptance and sustainability. A small proportion of operational HIEs have been evaluated, and more research is needed to identify and understand their success factors.",0,1,
1943,Use and prevention of isolation and restraint: a consensus statement of the American Emergency Psychiatric Association project Beta isolation and restraint working group.,"Issues of reducing and/or eliminating periods of isolation and restraint in patients with behavioral problems in crisis clinics, emergency rooms, inpatient psychiatric units, and specialized psychiatric emergency services remain an area of concern and debate among mental health clinicians. An important principle underlying the BETA Project (Best Practices in the Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation) is non-compulsive tension reduction as the preferred intervention in the management of acute agitation and threatening behavior. In this article, the authors review the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidelines governing their use in medical behavior settings, the negative consequences of this intervention on patients and staff, and the risk management strategies that are effective in reducing their quality improvement and use in a variety of treatment settings. An algorithm designed to help the clinician determine when isolation or restraint is most appropriate is introduced. The authors concluded that specialized psychiatric emergency services and emergency services may not be able to completely eliminate the use of segregation and restraint events because of their treatment primarily for acute patients, but that these programs may adopt strategies to reduce the rate of use of these types. interventions.",0,0,

Provider adherence to clinical guidelines for the treatment of SSTIs with putative MRSA remains inconsistent with prescriptive practices regarding patient discharge recommendations regarding antibiotic selection, wound culturing, and use of infection control techniques. Evidence shows that the use of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tools is valuable in improving provider awareness and adherence to clinical guidelines. This study was undertaken to examine whether the development of a CDS tool for the treatment of MRSA-related SSTIs to guide order entry and embed it into the electronic medical record program would improve provider adherence to the North Carolina Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Suspicious Community.

1946,Using computers to detect and respond to clinical events: impact on clinician behavior.,"prospective, randomized study of a primary care diabetes clinic used a computer to prospectively detect and recommend responses to simple, drug-related events as reflected in a computerized registry. There were two categories of events/recommendations: when the last observation of a test required for drug control was too old, the computer suggested a repeat"", and when an abnormality with therapeutic implications was detected, the computer suggested a specific change in therapeutics. Clinicians accounted for 36% of the events in the first category. responded with reminders and 11% responded without computer reminders (P < 0.0001);"" they responded to 28% of the events in the second category with computer assistance and 13% without (P < 0.026). For the most clinically significant of these second category events, the difference was even greater: 47% with computer assistance and 4% without computer assistance (P < 0.0004). I believe that computer detection and response (in the form of reminders) to simple clinical events will change clinician behavior.",1,1,
1947,The use of a computerized guideline for glucose regulation in the ICU improved both guideline adherence and glucose regulation.,"Purpose: To measure the effect of a computerized manual for glucose regulation in an intensive care unit. Design: A randomized controlled trial with an open-closed design. Methods: We implemented a paper glucose regulation guideline in an intensive care unit during the first study period. During the second semester, the guide was randomly applied, either on paper or on a computer. In the third period, the manual was only available in paper form. Measurements and results: We analyzed data from 484 patients. During the intervention period, the control group consisted of 54 patients and the computerized intervention group consisted of 66 patients. Two outcome measures for the guideline consisted of (a) glucose measurement timing recommendations and (b) adherence to insulin dose recommendation. We measured the clinical effect as the proportion of time glucose levels fell within the target range. In the first (paper-based) study period, 29.0% of samples occurred with optimal timing""; in the second period this increased to 35.5% for paper-based protocols and 40.2% for computerized protocols. Third study period timeliness scores returned Late (non-optimal) sampling occurred for 66% of glucose measurements in the first study period, 42% of the paper-based protocol samples and 28% of the computer-based protocol samples in the second study period. In the period, compliance with insulin dosing guideline was 56.3%; While it was 64.2% in paper-based protocols and 77.3% in computer-based protocols in the second period, it decreased to 42.4% in the third period. For the second study period, the time a patient's glucose levels fell within the target range compared to the first study period (44.3%) and the third period (42.3) for both the control (52.9%) and computerized groups (54.2%). improved by comparison. %). Conclusion: Implementation of a computerized version of a guideline significantly improved timely measurements and glucose level regulation for critically ill patients compared to implementing a paper-based version of the guideline.",1,1,
1948,Using a decision aid with information on overdetection to support informed choice about breast cancer screening: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Mammography screening can reduce breast cancer mortality. However, most women are unaware that minor diseases can also be detected through screening, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. We aimed to explore whether including information on breast cancer overdetection in a decision aid could help women aged around 50 years of age make an informed choice about breast screening. Methods We conducted a population-based, parallel group, randomized controlled trial using a random cohort of women aged 48–50 years in New South Wales, Australia. Participation in the study was by telephone""; women were eligible for women who had not had a mammogram in the past 2 years and did not have a personal or strong family history of breast cancer. We randomly selected 879 participants with a computer program from either intervention decision assistance (over-detection, breast cancer mortality reduction, and contains evidence-based descriptive and quantitative information about false positives) or a control decision aid (including information on breast cancer mortality reduction and false positives). defined as adequate knowledge and consistency) Primary outcome analyzed in all women who completed relevant follow-up interview questions complete This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Tria ls Registry, number ACTRN12613001035718. Findings 44 to intervention group from January 2014 to July 2014 0 women and 439 women were assigned to the control group. 21 women in the intervention group and 20 controls dropped out; Ten women and 11 controls assigned to the intervention did not answer all questions about attitudes. Therefore, 409 women and 408 controls in the intervention group were analyzed for primary outcome. Of the 409 women in the intervention group, 99 (24%) made an informed choice (difference 9%, 95% CI 3–14; p=0Â·0017), compared with 63 (15%) of 408 women in the control group. Compared with controls, more women in the intervention group met the threshold of adequate general knowledge (122/419 [29] vs 71/419 [17%]; difference 12%, 95% CI 6–18; p<0Â· 0001), fewer women expressed positive attitudes towards screening (282/409 [69%] vs 340/408 [83%]; 14.9–20%; p<0Â·0001) and fewer women (308/419 [74%]) seeking screening and 363/419 [87%]; 13.8–19%;"" p<0Â·0001). Considering only conceptual information, 203 (50%) of the 409 women in the intervention versus 79 (19%) of the 408 women in the control group ) made an informed choice (p<0Â·0001) Interpretation Information on overdetection of breast cancer provided in a decision aid has increased the number of women making an informed choice about breast screening Being more informed may mean that women are less likely to choose screening.",0,1,
1949,Using a fall prevention practice guideline for seniors living in the fall-risk community: a feasibility study,"Background: Falls occur frequently in the elderly and are a common cause of physical and psychological morbidity and healthcare use. The problem can be attributed to a complex interaction between health, behavioral and environmental factors. To provide a uniform and evidence-based approach, a practice guideline for fall prevention in community-dwelling elderly people at risk of falls has been developed. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of integrating a fall prevention practice guide into the daily practice of the 4 core health disciplines, namely general practitioners, nurses, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. METHODS: This was a descriptive study conducted by 10 local health networks across Flanders. Subjects included in the study were 99 primary care workers and 1,142 community-dwelling elderly patients (65 years or older) who were able to get up from a chair and move independently. For 6 months, primary care workers followed our fall prevention guideline, which consists of 3 parts (case finding, multifactor in-depth assessment and interventions). After the 6-month trial phase, participating primary care workers were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the feasibility of using the guideline in daily practice. RESULTS: The average time spent implementing the guideline was 32.0+/-14.0 minutes. Health professionals from all 4 disciplines saw case finding as their responsibility. The picture was different in terms of the evaluation of risk factors and interventions. Although 87.5% thought fall prevention is an important issue, healthcare professionals from different disciplines disagreed on how to integrate prevention guidelines into daily practice. Perceived barriers to the implementation of the guideline were lack of time (57.3%), low motivation of the target audience (53.3%), and insufficient cooperation among healthcare professionals (37.3%). CONCLUSION: A guide can be used to initiate the integration of prevention strategies into daily practice. Case finding is possible for all disciplines. Multifactor assessment and interventions require specific assignments, multidisciplinary collaboration and open communication.",0,0,
1950,Using action planning to increase the delivery of smoking cessation care by general practitioners: the role of plan specificity and implementation,"Background Strategies are needed to help general practitioners (GPs) promote smoking cessation as recommended by guidelines. This study examines whether the quality of action planning among GPs improves smoking cessation care. Methods The effectiveness of a 1-hour training program was examined in a cluster of randomized controlled trials involving 49 GPs. The GPs who followed the training (intervention group"";"" n?=?25) developed action plans to i) question smoking, ii) advise on smoking cessation, and iii) organize the follow-up of smokers who were motivated to quit. GPs also created a coping plan to encounter smokers who are not motivated to quit. The quality of these plans (plan specificity) were graded, and GPs reported on the performance of these plans 6 weeks after training (plan enactment). Multilevel regression analyzes were used to examine the effects of plan specificity and plan enforcement on patient-reported smoking cessation activities in the intervention group (n?=?1.632 patients) compared to the GPs control group (n?=?1.769 patients). . Results Compared with the control group, GPs who devised a highly specific action plan during training asked their patients to smoke more frequently after training than before training (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.51–2.95). GPs were more likely to ask patients about smoking after training than before training when they enacted a highly specific formulated action plan (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.04--4.64). The effects of the specificity of the GP plan and its enactment on asking patients about smoking were most evident among GPs who initially aimed to provide smoking cessation care. Conclusions A highly specific action plan formulated by a GP for when, how, and by whom patients should be asked about smoking has a positive effect on GPs asking patients about smoking, especially when they report that they have also implemented the plan. he had. This effect was most pronounced among GPs seeking to provide smoking cessation care prior to intervention. Training in designing personalized coping plans is recommended to further enhance GPs' advice on smoking cessation and to arrange follow-up support for smoking cessation.",1,1,
1951,Using an Internet portal to improve community-based pediatric ADHD care: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a quality improvement program to improve pediatric physicians' adherence to existing, evidence-based, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) practice guidelines. METHODS: A cluster of forty-nine community-based pediatricians across 8 practices participated in a randomized study. Practices were matched by the number of pediatricians and the proportion of patients receiving Medicaid. Medical charts of a random sample of ADHD patients were reviewed at baseline and at 6 months for each of the participating pediatricians. 4 sessions attended the training, including all practices, didactic lectures and office flow modification workshops. The apps were then given access to an ADHD Internet portal that allowed parents, teachers, and pediatricians to enter information about patients (eg, rating scales), after which the information was scored, interpreted, and formatted in a report style that was helpful for assessment and evaluation. Treatment of patients with ADHD. Physicians evaluated practice behaviors quarterly and addressed underperforming areas. RESULTS: Pediatricians in the intervention group showed significantly higher rates in many ADHD care practices recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, including parent (Cohen's d = 0.69) and teacher (d = 0.68) assessment, compared with those in the control group. Scales for assessing children with ADHD, use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria (d = 0.85) and use of teacher rating scales to monitor treatment responses (d = 1.01). CONCLUSION: A widely disseminated quality improvement intervention using Internet-based information technology has significantly improved the quality of ADHD care in community-based pediatric settings.",0,0,

1954,Discharge Use of Warfarin in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for ischemic stroke patients with atrial fibrillation, and previous studies have shown inadequate use of anticoagulation for these patients in China. We sought to explore the underlying causes and factors that currently affect warfarin use in China. METHODS: From June 2012 to January 2013, 19 604 patients with acute ischemic stroke were admitted to 219 city hospitals voluntarily participating in the China National Stroke Registry II. Multivariate logistic regression models using the generalized estimation equation method were used to identify patient/hospital factors independently associated with warfarin use at discharge. RESULTS: 19.4% of 952 acute ischemic stroke patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation were discharged with warfarin. Bleeding risk (52.8%) and patient rejection (31.9%) were the main reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation. Larger/teaching hospitals were more likely to prescribe warfarin. Older patients, heavy drinkers, and patients with a high National Health Stroke Scale score at presentation were less likely to receive warfarin, while patients with a history of heart failure and an internationally normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 at time of hospitalization were significantly associated with warfarin use. at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of warfarin use remains low in patients with ischemic stroke and known nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China. Hospital size and academic status, as well as patient age, heart failure, excessive alcohol consumption, international normalized rate in hospital, and stroke severity at admission were independently associated with warfarin use at discharge. There is much room for improvement for the prevention of secondary stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients in China.",0,0,

SETTING: Nine primary care pediatric practices. DESIGN: Questionnaire component of a randomized, prospective before-after trial. INTERVENTION: Newton MessagePad equipped with proprietary software (called ""AsthMonitor"") that assists in documenting clinical findings and provides guideline-based recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, 3 users gave a strongly positive overall rating, while 6 users were unbiased. The majority used the documentation functions sparingly at the same time. Other than recommendations for oxygen administration (not supported by evidence), users found the recommendations appropriate and appreciated the reminders. Seven out of 9 respondents believed that documenting with AsthMonitor took more time.

1956,Using “nudge” principles for order set design: before and after evaluation of an electronic prescribing template in critical care,"Objective Computerized order sets have the potential to reduce clinical variation and increase patient safety, but the effect is variable. We sought to evaluate the impact of changes in the design of an order set on the administration of chlorhexidine mouthwash and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to patients in the ICU. Methods The study was conducted at Bristol NHS Foundation Trust University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Clinical information system (CIS) is used in our intensive care unit. All medications and fluids are prescribed with the CIS, and medication and fluid charts are stored in a database. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was added as the default prescription to the prescribing template in January 2010. HES was removed from the prescribing template in April 2009. Both interventions were available for manual prescribing throughout the study period. We performed a database review of all eligible patients for each intervention before and after changes to the configuration of options in the prescribing system. Results It was determined that 2231 ventilated patients were suitable for chlorhexidine treatment, 591 were pre-intervention and 1640 post-intervention. Chlorhexidine was prescribed for 55.3% before and 90.4% after the change (p<0.001). In the HES intervention, 6199 patients, 2177 before the intervention and 4022 after the intervention were evaluated. The mean volume of HES infused per patient decreased from 630 mL to 20 mL after the change (p<0.001), and the percentage of patients receiving HES decreased from 54.1% to 3.1% (p<0.001). These results have been well preserved over time. Results The provision of options within an electronic prescribing system influenced the predictable delivery of evidence-based interventions, and the impact was well sustained. This approach has the potential to increase the effectiveness of computerized order sets.",1,1,
1957,Using a taxonomy of behavior modification techniques to identify active ingredients in trials of practice interventions for diabetes care,"BACKGROUND: Methodological guidelines for intervention reporting emphasize the detailed disclosure of intervention content. Despite this, systematic reviews of quality improvement (QI) implementation interventions continue to be limited by the lack of clarity and detail on the intervention content being evaluated. We aimed to apply the recently developed Taxonomy of Behavior Change Techniques version 1 (BCTTv1) to trials of practice interventions for diabetes management to evaluate the capacity and utility of this taxonomy to characterize active ingredients. METHODS: Three psychologists independently coded a random sample of 23 trials of healthcare system, provider, and/or patient-focused practice interventions from a systematic review of 142 such studies. Intervention content was coded using BCTTv1, which identified 93 behavior modification techniques (BCTs) grouped into 16 categories. We have supplemented the general encoding instructions in BCTTv1 with decision rules and examples from this literature. RESULTS: Less than a quarter of the possible BCTs in BCTTv1 were identified. For practice interventions targeting providers, the most commonly identified BCTs included: adding objects to the environment, directions/cues, instruction on how to perform the behavior, reliable source, goal setting (outcome), feedback on the outcome of the behavior, and social support (practice) . For practice interventions that also targeted patients, the most commonly identified BCTs included: warnings/cues, instruction on how to perform the behavior, information about health outcomes, restructuring the social environment, adding objects to the environment, social support (practice), and goal setting. (behaviour). BCTTv1 is well matched to practice interventions that directly target clinicians and patients, and can also be used to examine the impact of system-level interventions on clinician and patient behavior. RESULTS: BCTTv1 can be used to characterize active ingredients in trials of application interventions, providing content specificity beyond those given by broader intervention labels. Identifying BCTs can provide a more useful tool for accumulating information about the content used in trials of practice interventions, and it can help better inform replication efforts. In addition, the prospective use of a taxonomy of behavior modification techniques to develop and report intervention content will further assist in establishing a cumulative science of effective practice interventions.",0,0,
1958,Using planned behavior framework theory to explore hand hygiene beliefs at '5 critical moments' among Australian hospital nurses,"BACKGROUND: Improving hand hygiene among healthcare workers (HCWs) is the single most effective intervention in reducing healthcare-associated infections in hospitals. For healthcare professionals with the most patient contact (nurses), understanding the cognitive determinants of hand hygiene decisions is essential to improve compliance. The aim of this study was to investigate hospital-based nurses' beliefs about performing hand hygiene under the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO) 5 critical moments. Using the belief-based framework of Planned Behavior Theory, we examined nurses' attitudinal, normative, and control beliefs that underpin their decisions to perform hand hygiene according to recently implemented national guidelines. METHODS: Thematic content analysis of qualitative data from focus group interviews with hospital-based registered nurses from 5 wards in 3 hospitals in Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Significant advantages (patient and self-protection), disadvantages (time, hand damage), references (supportive: patients, colleagues"";"" unsupported: some doctors), barriers (too busy, emergencies), and facilitators (accessibility) sinks /products, training, reminders) were detected. There was some doubt about the relative importance of hand washing after contact with the patient's environment. CONCLUSIONS: The belief basis of the planned behavior theory provided a useful framework for systematically investigating the beliefs underlying nurses' hand hygiene decisions based on 5 critical moments, and allowed comparisons with previous belief studies. Nurses' commitment to improving hand hygiene practices during the 5 moments should focus on individual strategies to distract from other tasks, peer-based initiatives to foster a sense of shared responsibility, and management-focused solutions to tackle staffing and resource issues. After touching the patient's environment, hand hygiene continues to be reported as the most neglected opportunity for compliance.",0,0,

1960,Use of computerized clinical decision support for screening for occult tuberculosis infection.,"Past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines recommending screening of high-risk groups for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of computerized clinical decision support and guided web-based documentation on LTBI screening rates. Design Non-randomised, prospective, intervention study. Setting and participants Participants were 8,463 patients seen in two primary care, outpatient, public health center clinics in late 2002 and early 2003. The intervention CDC's LTBI guidelines are coded into a computerized clinical decision support system that provides an alert that suggests further advice. Assessment of LTBI risk if certain guideline criteria are met (birth and age <40 years in a high-risk TB country). A guided web-based documentation tool is provided to facilitate proper adherence to the LTBI screening guideline and to encourage accurate documentation and evaluation. Baseline data were collected for 15 weeks and study phase data for 12 weeks. Key outcome measures Appropriate LTBI screening according to CDC guidelines based on table review. Results Of the 4135 patients enrolled in the post-intervention phase, 73% had at least one CDC-defined risk factor, and 610 met the warning criteria for potential screening for LTBI (birth in a high-risk TB country and <40 years of age). . Adherence to the LTBI screening guideline improved significantly from 8.9% at baseline to 25.2% during the study phase (183% increase, p < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated that computerized clinical decision support using alerts and guided web-based documentation increases screening of high-risk patients for LTBI. Such technology could lead to an improvement in LTBI screening in the United States, and also shows promise for better care for other preventive and chronic conditions.",0,1,
1961,Using practice intentions to teach practitioners: changing practice behaviors through continuing education,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of practice intentions to increase the use of practice behavior among mental health practitioners attending a one-day continuing education class. METHODS: Seventy-eight practitioners were randomly assigned to one of two classes on psychiatric progression guidelines. One class included instruction (N=40) in the implementation objectives and the other class (N=38) did not. Practice intent training included consumers describing the best time and place to use a practitioner-guided procedure to help them complete a psychiatric advancement directive. Use of the practitioner-guided procedure was the dependent variable in this study. The practical use of the procedure was assessed with an electronic self-report questionnaire three months after the course. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two classroom conditions in participant characteristics or intentions to use pre- or post-class information and procedure. Fifty-four participants (69%) responded to the three-month follow-up questionnaire, stating that they used the practitioner-guided procedure. The results of the follow-up survey showed that class participants that combined their intention to practice used the practitioner-guided procedure significantly more often than those in the other class overall (80% versus 58%). The influence of practice intentions on the use of the practitioner-guided procedure was evident among practitioners with high post-class intentions but below the median for the overall sample (chi(2)=7.1, df=1, p<.01). Implementation rates among practitioners with the highest post-lesson intent were equivalent across the two classroom conditions.

METHODS: Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) not receiving lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were recruited and medical records were reviewed. Eligible subjects were randomized"";"" A clinical reminder stating current standards and local insurance policy is stamped on the paper table in the study group, but not in the control. The primary outcome was new LLT subscription at 6-month follow-up, and the secondary endpoint was the combined outcome of LLT or lipid profile control. RESULTS: 92 patients were assigned to the study group and 102 patients to the control group. The primary outcome showed no difference at 6 months (OR: 1.70, P = 0.248, 95% CI: 0.69-4.19). The secondary endpoint was significantly higher in the reminder group (OR: 2.81, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.57-5.04). CONCLUSION: A paper chart-based clinical reminder that provides up-to-date clinical recommendations can change the physician's behavior and increase attention to lipid levels. However, its effect cannot be translated into an increase in LLT or a decrease in low-density lipoprotein due to local policy constraint.",1,1,

METHODS: Observational study in a primary care setting with two loops of retrospective checks on test request forms. The aim of the study was to develop pathology-specific laboratory profiles and increase the number of preliminary diagnoses in laboratory test request forms. The Multi-Professional Multidisciplinary Interhospital Working Team developed pathology-specific laboratory profiles for more efficient testing demand. After 8 training sessions using a combined strategy with multiple interventions, 23 GPs in the trial region (Castelnovo ne Monti) tested the profiles""; 21 GPs in the Puianello region were the control group; both GPs Districts surveyed For both health regions All laboratory tests are performed in the Laboratory located in the research area. An initial and 1-year audit has been carried out on the GPs request forms in both districts. RESULTS: Laboratory profiles have been developed for the seven pathology-specific outpatients Year after the first audit cycle: 1) in the trial area the number of tests requested was significantly lower than in the previous year, with a decrease of approximately 5% (p < 0.001), 2) the prediagnosis on request forms was 52.8% in the trial region and 42% in the control region (P < 0.001); 3 ) the reduction in the number of tests in each request form was much more pronounced in the t-rial region (8.73 vs. 10.77; ""p < 0.001).

Methods: Published literature on this topic was described from 1980 to April 2007 by MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts. - Language studies in adults over 19 years of age. Search keywords included terms for depressive disorders and 12 specific second-generation antidepressants bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine. guide notes t Evidence and recommendations using the American College of Physicians clinical practice guidelines rating system. Recommendation 1: The American College of Physicians recommends that when clinicians choose pharmacological therapy to treat patients with acute major depression, they choose second-generation antidepressants based on their side-effect profile, cost, and patient preferences (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians regularly assess patient status, therapeutic response, and side effects of antidepressant therapy, beginning within 1 to 2 weeks of starting treatment (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 3: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians change therapy if the patient does not respond adequately to pharmacotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks of initiation of treatment for major depressive disorder (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 4: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians continue treatment for 4 to 9 months after a satisfactory response in patients with a first episode of major depressive disorder. An even longer duration of treatment may be beneficial for patients who have had 2 or more episodes of depression (Grade: strong recommendation; ""moderate-quality evidence"").",0,0,

Data were collected before, during, and after the intervention on a range of factors using the intervention, focus group, case note analysis, routine data, document analysis, and investigator observations. Results Recruitment and adoption factors were: the way the intervention was delivered, the competing demands for therapists' time, and the service manager's leadership. Service managers and therapists believe that the intervention: helps therapists establish a common rationale for clinical decisions; reported increasing clarity in service delivery and improving interactions with families and schools. During the study period, the behavior of the therapists changed: the rate of setting goals, probabilities 2.4 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.8); agreement on goals, 3.5 (2.4 to 5.1);"" assessment of progress, 2.0 (1.1 - 3.5). Children's IoT decreased by two months across services [95% CI ?8 to +4? months]. Cost per therapist trained ranged from Â¡Ãª1.003 to Â¡¡1.277, depending on service size and therapistsÂ¡Â¯ salary bands. Results Good Goals is a promising quality improvement intervention that can be implemented and adopted in practice and may have benefits (i) Further research is needed to evaluate the impact on patient outcomes, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and (ii) transferability to other clinical contexts.",0,1,
1967,Using standardized patients to measure the professional performance of physicians,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature of potential errors when using standardized patients (SPs) to measure physician behavior and to evaluate the potential impact of these inaccuracies on estimates of physician performance. DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial. ENVIRONMENT: Family physicians' offices. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen individuals, each describing one of the two patient scenarios, made a total of 179 visits to 92 family physicians who participated in a separate randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a training workshop on implementation of preventive guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The accuracy of SPs' descriptions of assigned scenarios and the accuracy of coding of physician performance are determined on the basis of audio tapes of visits and correlated with indicators of physicians' preventive practice. RESULTS: The accuracy of the depiction of the patient scenario was 84.8% for male CPs and 93.5% for female CPs. Inaccuracies in resuscitation had no effect on physician performance scores. The coding accuracy of physician performance was 90.5% (kappa = 0.66) for female CPs and 90.1% (kappa = 0.68) for male CPs. Coding errors occurred most frequently in the assessment of alcohol consumption and advice against smoking. CONCLUSION: CPs can provide valid information about the professional performance of physicians. However, the standardization of their activities should not be taken lightly. It may be more difficult to obtain standardized coding for consulting activities; this is one aspect of doctor visits that is particularly appropriate for TUs.",0,0,
1968,Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to understand adherence to multiple evidence-based indicators in primary care: a qualitative study,"Background There are accepted gaps between evidence and practice in general practice, which raises particular enforcement challenges. We screened previous clinical guideline recommendations to derive a set of Â¡Â®high-impactÂ¡Â¯ indicators based on criteria such as potential for significant patient benefit, improved scope of application, and eligibility for measurement using routinely collected data. Here, we explore the perceived determinants of healthcare professionals' adherence to these indicators, examining the extent to which the determinants are either indicator-specific or potentially generalizable across indicators. Methods We interviewed 60 GPs, practice nurses and practice managers in West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, about adherence to four indicators: “risky prescribing”, treatment goals in type 2 diabetes; blood pressure goals in treated hypertension; and anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation. Interview questions Theoretical. Based on Domains Framework (TDF) Data analyzed using framework analysis Results Professional role and identity and environmental context and resources were prominently featured across all indicators, while the importance of other domains, such as beliefs about outcomes, social influences, and knowledge, differed between indicators We identified five meta-themes representing the more general organizational and contextual factors common to all indicators Results TDF helped uncover a wide variety of reported predictors of adherence to Â¡Â®high-impactÂ¡Â¯ indicators in primary care. It was more difficult to determine which determinants would maximize change if The meta-themes highlight the need to align the design of interventions targeting general practices with higher-level supports and broader contextual considerations. However, our findings suggest that it is possible to develop interventions to promote the uptake of different evidence-based indicators that share common features, including context-specific adaptations.",0,0,
1969,Using the Research into Practice (TRIP) database: How do clinicians actually search?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinicians and patients are increasingly accessing information through Internet searches. This study aimed to examine clinicians' current search behavior while using the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) database to examine search engine usage and how it could be improved. METHODS: A blog analysis of the TRIP database, a meta-search engine covering 150 health resources including MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and miscellaneous guidelines, was conducted. The connectors for terms used in searches were examined and observations were made on the search behavior of 9 users while working with the TRIP database. RESULTS: Most of the 620,735 searches used a single term, with 12% (n = 75,947) using the Boolean operator: 11% (n = 69.006) ""AND"" and 0.8% (n = 4,941) ""OR"". Of the elements of a well-structured clinical question (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), population was most commonly used, while fewer searches included the intervention. The comparator and the result were rarely used. Participants in the observational study were interested in learning how to formulate better searches. RESULTS: Blog analysis showed that most searches used a single term and not Boolean operators. The observational study revealed that users are interested in making efficient searches, but do not always know how. Therefore, better training or better search interfaces are required to assist users and enable more effective searching.",0,0,
1970,Using theory to improve low back pain care in Australian Aboriginal primary care: a mixed-methods single-cohort pilot study.,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) care is often inconsistent with research evidence. This pilot study evaluated changes in LBP care following a systematic, theory-informed intervention in a rural Australian Aboriginal Health Service. We aimed to improve three aspects of care"", reducing inappropriate LBP radiological imaging referrals, increasing psychosocially focused patient assessment, and increasing the provision of LBP self-management information to patients. METHODS: Three interventions were developed to improve care using four steps. systematic implementation approach Mixed methods pre-cohort/ post-intervention design evaluated changes in three behaviors using a clinical audit of LBP care over a six-month period following administration before and after the intervention (GPs) Qualitative analysis was guided by the theoretical domains framework RESULTS: Proportion of patients receiving guideline-inconsistent imaging referrals (GICI) , increased from 4.1 GICI per 10 patients to 0.4 (95% CI for reduction in ratio: 1.6 to 5.6 ) among GPs involved in the intervention Among GPs who were not participants (starting post-intervention) locum/part-time GPs) GICI rate 10 patients increased from 1.5 to 4.4 per a (95% CI for rate increase: from .5 to 5.3). There was a modest increase in the number of patients who received LBP self-management information from participating GPs, and there was no significant change in psychosocially oriented patient assessments by any of the participants,"" although GPs did report qualitative changes in their behavior. Environmental and resource factors, including clinical tools embedded in the software, were identified as future strategies. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic intervention model resulted in partial improvements in LBP care. Determinants of practice change among GPs Increasing knowledge of clinical guidelines, one recognized as a reliable source of information awareness of the negative consequences of education and inappropriate practices, particularly radiological imaging, on patient outcomes and inconsistent and evidence-based practice among Locum practitioners Problems are an emerging problem that will be a major challenge in the future.

1972,Validation of the SF-36 health survey questionnaire: new outcome measure for primary care,"OBJECTIVES To test the acceptability, validity and reliability of the short form 36 health questionnaire questionnaires (SF-36) and compare with the Nottingham health profile. DESIGN Postal questionnaire using a questionnaire booklet with a letter from the general practitioner. Those who did not respond received two reminders two weeks apart. The SF-36 questionnaire was retested on a subsample of respondents two weeks after the initial mailing. SETTING Two common practices in Sheffield. PATIENTS 1980 patients aged 16-74 years randomly selected from two application lists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Scores for each health dimension in the SF-36 questionnaire and the Nottingham health profile. Responses to questions about end use and sociodemographic characteristics of health services. RESULTS The response rate of the SF-36 questionnaire was high (83%), and completion rate for each dimension was over 95%. There was substantial evidence for construct validity in terms of reliability of the SF-36 (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.85, reliability coefficient greater than 0.75 for all dimensions except social functioning) and in distinguishing groups with expected health differences. The SF-36 was able to detect low health status in patients who scored 0 (good health) on the Nottingham health profile. CONCLUSIONS The SF-36 is a promising new tool for measuring health perception in the general population. It is easy to use, acceptable to patients, and meets strict criteria for reliability and validity. Its use in other contexts and with different disease groups requires further research.",0,0,
1973,Variations in GPs' decision to investigate suspected lung cancer: a factorial experiment using multimedia vignettes.,"Introduction Lung cancer survival in the UK is low and relatively poor. Patients with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer often present to primary care, but it is unclear how general practitioners (GPs) distinguish which patients require further investigation. This study examined how patients' clinical and sociodemographic characteristics affect GPs' decisions to initiate lung cancer research. Methods A factorial experiment was conducted among a national sample of 227 British practitioners using vignettes presented as simulated consultations. A multimedia interactive website simulated key features of consultations using actors (""patients""). GP participants made online management decisions for six ""patients"" whose sociodemographic characteristics systematically varied at three cancer risk levels. In low-risk vignettes, investigation (i.e., chest X-ray requested, CT scan, or respiratory consultant referral) was not specified""; investigation may be appropriate in medium-risk vignettes; investigation was strictly indicated in high-risk vignettes Each ""patient"" had two lung cancer-related symptoms: one volunteered and Others emerged if GPs wanted. Variations in trial probability were examined using multilevel logistic regression. Results Doctors decided to investigate lung cancer in 74% (1000/1348) studies. The probability of trial did not increase with cancer risk. however, he was more likely to seek information when he requested information about involuntary symptoms (adjusted OR (AOR)=3.18; 95% CI 2.27 to 4.70) ), however, GPs in 42% (570/1348) of cases neglected to seek information. GPs were more likely to seek older ""patients"" (AOR=0.52; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.7) and lower than blacks. more 'patients' than white (AOR = 0.6 8;"" 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). Results GPs were not more likely to investigate high-risk 'patients' than low-risk cancer symptoms. Also, they equally treated everyone with the same symptoms. Inadequate data collection may be responsible for missed opportunities in diagnosis.",0,1,

1975,"Violence and Aggression: Short-Term Management in Mental Health, Health and Community Settings: Updated edition.","Â This guide has been developed to provide advice on the short-term management of violence and aggression in mental health, health, and community settings in adults, children (12 years and younger), and youth (13 to 17 years). This guide updates Violence: The Short-Term Management of Uncomfortable/Violent Behavior in Patient Psychiatric Settings and Emergency Rooms (NICE clinical guide 25), developed by the National Nursing and Supportive Care Collaborative Center and published in 2005. With the publication of the 2005 guideline, there have been some significant advances in our knowledge of the management of violence and aggression, including service users' views on the use of physical intervention and seclusion, and the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of drugs and their dosages. For quick calming. Previous guidance was limited to persons 16 years of age and older in adult psychiatric settings and emergency departments"";"" this update has been expanded to include some of the previously excluded populations and settings. All areas of the NICE clinical guideline 25 have been updated and this guide will replace it. The guideline recommendations were developed after careful consideration of the best available evidence by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, individuals with mental health conditions who have personally experienced the management of violent or aggressive behavior, their caregivers, and guideline methodologists. The guide is intended to be helpful to clinicians and service commissioners in the delivery and planning of high-quality care for the management of violence and aggression, while also emphasizing the importance of the care experience of these service users and the experience of their caregivers.

1976,Violence in general practitioners: a survey of general practitioners' views.,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the extent of abuse and violence against general practitioners during their professional duties and to classify the characteristics of this type of aggression. DESIGN Retrospective survey of the views of a large sample of general practitioners using a piloted postal survey. SET All medical practices in the West Midlands. SUBJECTS A total of 1093 GPs who answered the questionnaire (40.6% of the total sample). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Number of cases of aggression experienced by GPs and incidence of various triggering factors over a 12-month period. RESULTS Although the response was low at 40.6%, this study is the largest published database on aggression towards family physicians. In total, 687 (62.9%) respondents had experienced harassment or violence in the previous 12 months, 191 (17.5%) experienced some form of harassment at least once a month, and 11 (1%) every time. suffered verbal abuse. day. Even assuming that all non-responders did not experience any form of violence, patient aggression affects 25.5% of GPs in the west central regions. For practitioners experiencing patient aggression, the annual incidence of events per GP is 2.42. Of these general practitioners, 96 (14%) thought that aggression was increased. A total of 1520 (91.3%) of all incidents involved threats without verbal abuse or direct physical action. Surgery was the place where aggression was most common with 942 (56.6%) events"";"" however, 90 (62.5%) of the injuries and assaults occurred during home visits, and 22 (66%) occurred during night calls. Relatives were aggressive in 668 (37.6%) cases, anxiety in 435 (25.7%) cases, and long waiting in 183 (10.8%) cases. CONCLUSIONS Violence against GPs is common and may be on the rise. Some of the triggers of aggression are potentially avoidable, and applications must make extensive attempts to identify such factors and correct them. Training of staff in interpersonal skills and recognizing anxious or intoxicated patients is essential and should be supplemented with consideration of operative order and repair. Physicians should avoid delays for patients by rearranging reservation policies or surgery times and lengths. Victims of aggression should be pursued. A prospective study or centralized registry of events should be funded.",0,0,
1977,'We can only do what we can do' for general practitioners' views on primary care for older people with complex health problems,"BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change, general practitioners (GPs) are increasingly required to care for older people with complex health problems. Little is known about GPs' subjective assessment of the requested changes. Our aim is to explore how general practitioners view their professional mandate and capacity to provide comprehensive care to older people with complex health problems. Does geriatric education or experience affect their perspective? Can the barriers to implementing changes in primary care for the elderly with complex health problems be identified? METHODS: Prior to a controlled intervention study on case management for elderly patients in primary care (OMAHA II), this qualitative study included 10 general practitioners with varying degrees of geriatric qualifications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and audio recorded. Full interview transcripts were analyzed on a case-by-case basis and starting with open coding in case descriptions. The resulting thematic structure was enriched with comparative dimensions through repeated inter-situation comparison and transformed into a multidimensional typology of views. RESULTS: Based on the themes emerging from the data and presentations by the GPs interviewed, we were able to identify three different types of views on primary care for older people with complex health problems: 'manoeuvring across the boundaries of competence', 'Herculean task' and 'collaboration and networking' '. Types of views differ in role perception, self-perception of professional space, and patterns of action regarding cooperation. One species shows strong correspondence with a geriatrician. A common concern across all groups is the availability of adequate resources to meet the challenges of primary care for older people with complex health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Limited financial resources, lack of cooperation networks and attitudes appear to be barriers to providing better primary care to older people with complex health problems. Geriatrics education is likely to have a positive impact on overcoming these barriers, but needs to be supported by reimbursement regulations. First of all, general practitioners' care for older people with complex health problems needs a conceptual framework that provides guidance on their specific roles and contributions and help networks. For example, it is essential that general practice guidelines be made clearer on managing older people with complex health problems.",0,0,
1978,Web-based computer adaptation for practice nurses aiming to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines: A study protocol for a randomized controlled efficacy study.,"BACKGROUND: Dutch practice nurses are insufficiently committed to evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines. Web-based computer adaptation can be effective in improving their adherence to the manual. Therefore, this article aims to describe the development of a web-based, computerized program and the design of a randomized controlled trial testing its (cost) efficacy. METHODS: A web-based, computerized program was developed that included three modules with tailored advice and an online forum, theoretically based on the I-Change Model and The Theory of Self-Determination, and based on the results of a qualitative needs assessment among practice nurses. , up-to-date information on smoking cessation, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and modules with project information and a consulting checklist. Program impacts are evaluated by comparing an intervention group (access to all modules) and a control group (access to FAQs, project information and consulting checklist only). Adherence to the smoking cessation guideline and behavioral determinants (i.e. intention, knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, social impact, action, and coping planning) are measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. In addition, the indirect effects of the program on smokers' quit rates and attempts to quit after the 6th and 12th months are evaluated. DISCUSSION: This article describes the study design of a randomized controlled trial that tested the (cost) efficacy and development of a web-based, computerized compliance support program for practice nurses. This program potentially contributes to improving the quality of smoking cessation care in Dutch general practice. If proven effective, the program could be adapted for use by other health professionals, increasing the public health benefits of improved smoking cessation counseling for smokers.",0,0,
1979,Web-based interventions for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: systematic review and future directions.,"Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), the application of psychological and behavioral interventions through the use of technology, provide clinicians with the opportunity to deliver care in a way that transcends a range of treatment barriers. Web-based interventions are a subset of ICTs that are emerging as promising alternatives to in-person treatment delivery and monitoring for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). A systematic review of the literature resulted in five empirical studies of web-based interventions for UC and CD. Additionally, an informal search by a popular search engine provided limited, currently available web-based interventions for patients with UC and CD. Despite being an ideal population for the development and dissemination of online interventions, patients with UC and CD have far fewer treatment options compared to other behavioral health problems. However, given the growing body of research that includes web-based interventions for other conditions, researchers and clinicians targeting the management and treatment of UC and CD have the advantage of being able to use the BIT model, an existing conceptual framework for web-based development.

1980,Weekly Email reminders influence emergency physician behavior: A case study using the Joint Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Pneumonia Guidelines.,"OBJECTIVES: Improving physician compliance with evidence-based guidelines is difficult. The authors wanted to determine whether weekly email reminders to emergency room (ED) personnel improve compliance with Joint Commission and Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) community-acquired pneumonia quality measures. METHODS: A nurse administrator reviewed weekly records of all adult patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency department with a working pneumonia diagnosis. An email was then sent to all emergency room personnel stating the percentage of patients who were scheduled for antibiotics less than 4 hours after arrival. The names of people who administered antibiotics in less than 1 hour were highlighted. This study compared time elapsed with antibiotics 11 months before and 11 months after the start of this intervention. RESULTS: The control cohort had 281 patients, 37 meeting the exclusion criteria, leaving 244 for analysis. The intervention cohort had 342 patients, of whom 40 met the exclusion criteria and left 302 for analysis. The median time from arrival to chest radiograph order was significantly reduced from 61 to 47 minutes (p < 0.001). The median time interval from the time of chest radiography to administration of antibiotics did not change significantly (92 to 88 minutes, p = 0.294). The overall median time from arrival to antibiotic administration was significantly reduced from 162 minutes to 146 minutes (p = 0.018). The percentage of patients administered antibiotics within 4 hours increased from 77.5% to 86.1% (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Weekly email reminders listing performance on antibiotic administration recommendations are associated with increased compliance with a clinical guideline.",1,1,

1982,"Weight maintenance: challenges, tools and strategies for primary care physicians","Obesity is considered a chronic disease and one of the biggest health problems we face today. Weight loss can be achieved through lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical interventions, but weight maintenance remains a lifelong challenge for individuals with obesity. Guidelines for obesity management have emphasized the role of primary care providers (PCPs). This review examines the long-term results of clinical trials to identify effective weight maintenance strategies that can be used by PCPs. Due to the broad nature of the subject, a structured PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant research articles, peer-reviewed reviews, guidelines, and articles published by regulatory agencies. Trials have shown the benefit of sustained weight loss in managing obesity and co-morbidities. It is known that maintaining 5-10% weight loss for >/=1 year improves many comorbidities. Maintaining weight through lifestyle change is possible—though difficult—but requires long-term support through diet, physical activity, and reinforcement of behavior changes. Adding pharmacotherapy to lifestyle interventions promotes greater and more sustainable weight loss. Clinical evidence and recently approved pharmacotherapy have provided PCPs with advanced strategies to support their patients in the maintenance of weight loss. More work is needed to evaluate the translation of these strategies into clinical practice.",0,0,

1985,WellDoc mobile diabetes management randomized controlled trial: change in clinical and behavioral outcomes and patient and physician satisfaction,"BACKGROUND: Less than 63% of individuals with diabetes meet the professional guidelines' hemoglobin A1c target of <7.0%, and only 7% meet the combined glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure targets. The aim of the primary study was to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone-based diabetes management software system on A1c, used in conjunction with web-based data analytics and treatment optimization tools. Secondary objectives examined healthcare provider (HCP) adherence to prescribing guidelines and evaluated HCPs adoption of technology. METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from three community medicine practices for a 3-month study and were equally randomized. The intervention group received cell phone-based software designed by endocrinologists and CDEs (WellDoc Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD). The software provided real-time feedback on patients' blood glucose levels, displayed patients' medication regimens, combined hypo- and hyperglycemia treatment algorithms, and requested additional data needed to evaluate diabetes management. Patient data captured and transferred to secure servers were analyzed with special statistical algorithms. The system sent computer-generated logbooks (with recommended treatment plans) to the HCPs of intervention patients. RESULTS: The mean reduction in A1c for intervention patients was 2.03% compared to 0.68% for control patients (P < 0.02, one-tailed). 84% of intervention patients had drugs titrated or changed by their HCP compared to controls (23%, P = 0.002). Intervention patients' HCPs reported that the system facilitates treatment decisions, provides regular data, and reduces registry review time. RESULTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes using WellDoc's software achieved statistically significant improvements in A1c. HCP and patient satisfaction with the system were clinically and statistically significant.",0,0,
1986,What are the attitudes of specialist mental health clinicians towards guideline recommendations for the treatment of depression in young people?,"OBJECTIVES: As part of an initiative to implement evidence-based practice in the service, we sought to examine possible barriers to the use of evidence-based guidelines for youth depression in a tertiary specialist mental health service. METHODS: This is a qualitative study that adopts a social constructivist perspective using focus groups. Focus groups conducted with all clinicians (medical and allied health) were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis was performed. Clinicians were asked about barriers to implementing four key recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers (i) at the individual clinician level; (ii) at the clinical level in terms of youth presentation; and (iii) service level. A key hurdle at the individual clinician level was the expressed belief that the guidelines were not relevant to young people applying for services and that there was little evidence to guide practice. The main barrier to relevant, clinical presentation was the severity and complexity of this presentation, often making it difficult to deliver interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). At the service level, the lack of integration with primary and secondary care meant that it was difficult to rank interventions according to guideline recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The development of an evidence base is a clear imperative to enable research and dissemination of effective treatments for young people up to 25 years of age with serious and complex disorders, including co-morbid conditions, risk of suicide and psychosocial difficulties. Furthermore, this study underlined the need for greater investment in care models that enable integration between existing primary and secondary health care services and advanced specialist early intervention mental health services for youth.",0,0,
1987,What do GPs think and do about prostate cancer screening in Australia?,"BACKGROUND: Men seek advice from their general practitioner (GP) about the benefits of prostate cancer screening. This study aimed to examine how GPs' knowledge and clinical experience affect their position in prostate cancer screening. METHODS: A total of 13 focus groups were formed with 77 general practitioners. Focus group interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed by two researchers through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Doctors were evenly divided between those who proactively screened men for prostate cancer and those who only did so at the patient's request. GPs had limited knowledge of the recently published evidence from studies on prostate cancer screening. CONCLUSION: To encourage evidence-based decision-making by GPs and their patients, effective methods of increasing GP knowledge about evidence-based recommendations and potentially changing clinical behavior are required.",0,0,

Setting The interviews were conducted at the participants' homes or by telephone. One participant sent his answers to the questionnaire by e-mail. Results Analysis of interview data revealed: (1) substantial knowledge of patients and their relatives about healthcare risks, problems, and events""; (2) interviewees' insights into care improvement opportunities;"" and (3) the difficulties faced by patients and family members when trying to negotiate their knowledge and understanding with healthcare personnel. Conclusion Patients (and family members) need access to structured processes that enable dialogue with healthcare personnel about perceived risks, problems and events. This type of dialogue will raise questions and information from patients and family members about improvement opportunities and minimize the risk of their questions and information being ignored.",0,0,
1989,What do people with mental illness need to quit smoking? Mental health consumer and provider perspectives,"OBJECTIVES: Forty-one percent (41%) of people in the United States who have reported recent mental illness are also smokers. In this population, tobacco use is associated with up to 25 years of reduced life expectancy and excessive medical comorbidity compared to the general population. Although research shows that tobacco interventions can be effective for people with mental illness, they are not widely used in clinical practice. The current study explored how to adapt evidence-based tobacco cessation interventions to meet the unique physiological, psychological and social challenges faced by people with mental illness. METHODS: Ten focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured discussion"";"" 5 for adult mental health consumers (n = 62) and 5 with mental health clinicians and administrators (n = 22). Content analysis was used to categorize themes. RESULTS: Five thematic categories were found: (1) Barriers to treatment, (2) Resources and infrastructure, (3) Adverse effects on smoking behavior, (4) Lack of knowledge, and (5) Treatment needs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings guide the development of appropriate tobacco cessation services for this population. Specifically, these data were included in a mental health provider toolkit for smoking cessation and informed the development of a tobacco cessation intervention study.",0,0,

1991,Which implementation interventions increase cancer screening rates? a systematic review,"Background Appropriate screening can reduce the mortality and morbidity of colorectal, breast and cervical cancers. However, effective implementation strategies are warranted if the full benefits of screening are to be realized. As part of a larger agenda to create a practice guideline, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate interventions designed to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rate. Interventions considered were: client reminders, client incentives, mass media, small media, group training, one-on-one training, reduction in structural barriers, reduction in out-of-pocket expenses, provider evaluation and feedback interventions, and provider incentives. Our primary outcome, screening completion, was calculated as the overall median post-intervention absolute percentage point (PP) change in completed screening tests. Methods Our first step was to conduct an iterative scope review of the research area. This provided three relevant high-quality systematic reviews. We've made an official update, serving as our evidence base. Randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials published between 2004 and 2010 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCHinfo. Results The update provided 66 studies with 74 comparisons and new eligible studies. The new studies varied significantly in quality. Client reminders, small media, and provider supervision and feedback appear to be effective interventions to increase screening uptake for the three cancers. One-on-one training and reducing structural barriers also appear to be effective, but their roles in CRC and cervical screening, respectively, are less established. More work is needed to evaluate customer incentives, mass media, group training, out-of-pocket reduction, and provider incentive interventions. Conclusion New evidence is generally consistent with evidence and conclusions from the original systematic reviews. This review served as an evidence base for a practice guide. Inadequate reporting, lack of precision and consistency in describing operational elements, and inadequate assessment of context and differences between populations are additional areas of research.",0,1,
1992,What is the role of the general practitioner versus the family carer of a relative with dementia living in the community? A systematic literature review,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes and perspectives of family physicians towards the caregivers of their relatives with dementia and to define the satisfaction of the caregivers. DESIGN: Systematic review. SUBJECTS: The population studied consists of the dementia family and their practitioners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the general practitioner's duties and skills to improve home care from the family caregiver's perspective. Caregivers were assessed for their satisfaction with the care provided by their general practitioner. CONCLUSIONS: The GP is aware of the skills and limitations of his role in all aspects of dementia care and towards the family caregiver. They also recognized the importance of an adequate diagnostic process, but were uncomfortable explaining the diagnosis to both the patient and caregiver. They reported that they relied more on treatment issues rather than diagnostic stages. Caregivers' reports of their general practitioner's attitude during the diagnostic process were rated from helpful to inadequate empathy. General practitioners found themselves highly involved in home dementia care, but caregivers found their involvement insufficient. The general practitioners' lack of appropriate communication skills was also not appreciated by the caregivers. Lack of time and reward was recognized by the GP as a major barrier to dementia care. CONCLUSION: The key role of general practitioners as care providers and care planners is reinforced by their confidence in the skills of family caregivers. Clear guidelines, from early detection to adequate referrals, should enhance the GP's ability to support these time and energy consuming home care situations. Intervention studies that address gaps in general practitioners' skills in dementia home care management can be helpful in supporting the family caregiver.",0,0,
1993,"What is the value of routine use of patient-reported outcome measures to improve patient outcomes, processes of care, and healthcare outcomes in cancer care? A systematic review of controlled studies","OBJECTIVE: The systematic use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) has been advocated as an effective way to standardize cancer practice. Still, the question of whether PROMs will lead to real improvements in the quality of patient care is still a matter of debate. This review examined whether the inclusion of PROM in routine clinical practice is associated with improvements in patient outcomes, processes of care, and healthcare outcomes during active anticancer therapy. METHODS: Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials of patients receiving active anticancer therapy or supportive care regardless of cancer type. RESULTS: We included 26 articles reporting on 24 unique controlled studies based on predetermined eligibility criteria. Wide variation was evident in the design and use of the interventions presented, the evaluation of outcomes, and the cancer- and modality-specific context. Healthcare outcomes were rarely included as endpoints only. Overall, the number of statistically significant findings was limited and intervention effect sizes of PROMs were predominantly small-to-moderate. CONCLUSION: The routine use of PROMs increases the frequency of discussion of patient outcomes during consultations. In some studies, PROMs are associated with improved symptom control, increased supportive care measures, and patient satisfaction. Additional effort is required to ensure patient engagement as well as additional support with open system guidelines to guide their responses to clinicians who will respond to the patient's concerns and problems. More research is needed to support the cost-benefit of PROM in terms of patient safety, clinician burden, and healthcare utilization.",0,0,
1994,What will we teach undergraduate students?,"The opinions of 600 randomly selected doctors about what should be taught to university students in clinical years were analyzed. Respondents gave high priority to general medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, casualties, and gynecology, while low priority to forensic medicine, plastic surgery, radiotherapy, anesthetics, radiology, and rehabilitation medicine. Doctors thought these should be taught to graduate students. The two large groups of doctors - GPs and counselors - gave essentially the same priorities. Undergraduate curricula may not include all major specializations, so the results of this analysis can provide a useful basis for selecting the most appropriate courses. The criteria for inclusion of other specialties may be the talent and enthusiasm of teachers and well thought out and academically sound teaching programs.",0,0,
1995,What's in a setting?: The impact of organizational culture on provider adherence to clinical guidelines for the treatment of tobacco use,"BACKGROUND: Organizational culture is an important but under-researched feature of the work environment that can influence provider behavior, including adherence to clinical practice guidelines. There is substantial evidence that medical assistance to smokers can lead to significant reductions in tobacco use. However, this evidence has not translated well to practice, as only a small proportion of smokers receive the recommended treatment during medical visits. OBJECTIVE: This study examines organizational culture as a contextual feature of primary care clinics and its impact on adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco use. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 500 primary care providers at 60 community clinics located in New York City. Relationships between provider compliance with ""5A"" clinical guidelines and both provider and institutional covariates were described, as recommended by the US Public Health Service. We used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the relationships between clinical culture and provider treatment models. RESULTS: Providers in clinics with stronger 'group/clan', 'hierarchical' and 'rational' culture types compared with 'developmental' culture reported greater adherence to 5A guidelines (p < .05). System-level structures and maintenance processes were positively associated (p < .01), while the number of ongoing quality initiatives was negatively associated with 5A delivery (p < .05). Provider familiarity with guidelines (p < .01), confidence in cessation counseling (p < .05), and perceived effectiveness in helping smokers quit were associated with more frequent 5A interventions (p < .01). PRACTICE PRACTICES: Findings suggest that institutional culture can influence provider adherence to cessation treatment guidelines, even when controlling for other factors known to influence practice patterns. Specifically, cultures that emphasize human resources and performance standards are conducive to integrating the 5A guidelines into routine practice. Understanding the role of organizational culture enables health managers and practitioners to be strategic when applying and maintaining the use of evidence-based guidelines.",0,0,
1996,What's on your Facebook profile? Evaluation of an educational intervention to encourage appropriate use of privacy settings on social networking sites by medical students,"BACKGROUND: The rise of social media has led to growing concerns about the potential impact of 'unprofessional' posts by doctors and medical students on individuals, institutions and the medical profession. Relevant and effective guidelines have been difficult to develop and implement, and students and physicians need to consider how their online activities may be perceived in the context of their professional roles. The aim of this project was to examine the online presence of a Canadian medical school graduating class by scanning the students' public profiles on the social media site Facebook, to incorporate this knowledge into an educational activity for professionalism and social media, and to evaluate the impact of this. Activity on student behavior. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for the public Facebook profiles of each member of the class and data was collected on the types of material that anyone could see. These were presented as part of a training session on social media and professionalism. A month later, the Facebook search was repeated. RESULTS: The profiles of 121 (79.8%) of the 152 students in the class were found. Most students used appropriately restrictive privacy settings"";"" however, a significant minority had publicly visible information, including comments, photos, location, and medical student status. The educational innovation was well received, with over 90% of students agreeing that this topic is important and well handled. A follow-up study found that many students changed their privacy settings to make less information public. CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant proportion of students share potentially unprofessional content on social media. An interactive educational intervention involving private disclosure of how participants appear to others on social media resulted in a significant change in student behavior.",0,0,
1997,When is it cost-effective to change the behavior of healthcare professionals?,"Because of the way health care systems work, new, important, and cost-effective treatments sometimes do not become routine care, while well-marketed products of uncertain value are widely adopted. Should policymakers seek to influence clinical behavior and correct these inefficiencies? Implementation methods provide some level of behavior change, but are costly to enact. These factors can be combined with the cost-effectiveness of treatments to estimate an overall policy cost-effectiveness. In general, policy cost-effectiveness is always less attractive than treatment cost-effectiveness. As a result, trying to improve the uptake of underutilized affordable care or reduce the overuse of new and expensive treatments may not always make economic sense. In this article, we present a method for calculating policy cost-effectiveness and illustrate this with examples from a recent trial of educational access conducted by community pharmacists to influence physician prescribing in England in 1997 and 1998.",0,0,
1998,When pharmacotherapeutic recommendations may adversely affect physician decision-making,"Long-term medical literature has shown that patients do not always receive appropriate care, including pharmacotherapeutic treatment. Physician-focused interventions are implemented internationally to apply evidence-based medicine in the routine daily practice of medical practitioners to achieve improved patient care. The pharmacy profession has taken an active role in providing evidence-based prescribing and intervention strategies aimed at improving the quality and safety of drug use. However, the medical literature also supports the idea that current clinical care recommendations do not always have the desired effect on physician behavior. We argue that the established theory of psychological response may at least partially explain situations in which doctors do not act on such recommendations. Response theory posits that when we are offered to take a certain action, a motivational situation compels us to react in a way that affirms our freedom of choice. We often choose to do the opposite of what the advice suggests we do, or simply settle into our first position. The core concepts of psychological reactance are universal and likely to be applicable to the provision of advice to physicians. Advice on clinical care, including pharmacotherapy, may carry tacit threats, as it may be perceived as an attempt to restrict one's freedom of choice, potentially as efforts to reactance and avoid them. By identifying and taking into account factors likely to increase reactance, physician-focused interventions can become more effective.",0,0,

2003,Why are clinicians not embracing results from major clinical trials in severe sepsis? Bayesian analysis,"BACKGROUND: Five major clinical studies (Intensive Insulin Therapy""; Recombinant Human Activated Protein C [rhAPC]; Low Tidal Volume; Low Dose Steroid; Early Targeted Therapy [EGDT]) have demonstrated reduced mortality in patients with severe sepsis and in specialist guidelines. has recommended them to clinical practice. However, adoption of these therapies remains low among clinicians. OBJECTIVES: We selected these five studies and asked: Question 1--What is the current probability that the new treatment will not be better than standard?Care for my patient with severe sepsis Question 2-Relative death for my patient with severe sepsis What is the current probability of reducing the risk (RRR) with significant clinical thresholds (RRR >15%; >20%; >25%) METHODS: This study applied Bayesian methodologies Odds ratio (OR) for Question 1 and RRR for Question 2 Effective sample sizes of other relevant clinical studies (negative evidence) Background distributions, prior distributions, and data from key studies (positive evidence) was calculated by merging. MAIN RESULTS: Answer 1--The previously mildly skeptical analysis showed beneficial results with the Intense Insulin, rhAPC and Low Tidal Volume trials, but not the Low Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. The results of all trials become unacceptable by analyzes using moderate or severely skeptical priorities. Answer 2--If we are targeting RRR>15%, mildly skeptical analysis shows that the current probability of reducing death with this clinical threshold is 88% for Intensive Insulin and 62-65% for Low Tidal Volume, rhAPC. , 17% for the EGDT trials and the Low Dose Steroid trial. Moderate to severe skeptical analyzes do not show a clinically significant reduction in the risk of death for all trials. If we target the RRR >20% or >25%, all benefits are less likely, regardless of the degree of suspicion. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical threshold analysis offers a new bedside tool to be applied directly to the care of patients with severe sepsis. Our results show that the strength of evidence (statistical and clinical) is weak for all trials, particularly the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. It is crucial to replicate the results of each of these five clinical trials in confirmatory studies if we are to provide patient care based on scientifically sound evidence.",0,0,
2004,Why do doctors treat relatives? Exploring the impact of social psychology,"Doctors often receive requests for treatment, medical advice, or other intervention from relatives. Most doctors are asleep. Reasons for compliance can be categorized according to doctors' relatives, colleagues, themselves, ethical guidelines, and attitudes towards the problem. Adaptation can also be influenced by elements of social psychology. Social exchange theory, techniques of persuasion, attribution, conformity, desire for approval, and the principle of affinity can all cause interference. Future research should explore physicians' attitudes towards relatives, the environment in which requests are made, treatment outcomes, changes in the relationship following treatment, cultural or familial norms, and changes in clinicians' beliefs or behaviors when faced with conflicting wishes and guidelines. Being aware of these effects can help physicians make objective decisions about intervention.",0,0,

2007,Why do providers transfuse blood products outside of recommended guidelines despite integrated electronic best practice alerts?,"BACKGROUND: Best practice advisories (BPAs) provide point-of-care clinical decision support (CDS) to reduce unnecessary blood product transfusions, but substantial transfusions continue outside recommended guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To understand why providers order blood transfusions outside of recommended guidelines despite interrupted warnings. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Health care providers receiving inpatient treatment. INTERVENTION: Provider-BPA interaction data was collected from the hospital's electronic medical records from January 2011 to August 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Provider's (free text) responses to blood transfusion BPA requests were independently reviewed and categorized by 2 licensed physicians, assessed by agreement chi(2) analysis and kappa scoring. RESULTS: The rationale for voiding blood transfusion BPAs was quite diverse, the most common being acute bleeding (>34%), followed by protocol-bound behavior in specialized services (up to 26%), to ""symptomatic"" anemia (11-12%). . . Many providers transfused in anticipation of surgical or procedural intervention (10-15%) or imminent hospital discharge (2%-5%). Resident physicians represented the majority (55%) of providers interacting with BPAs. CONCLUSION: Providers that interact with BPAs (primarily residents and intermediate providers) often do not have the negotiation power to change order behavior. Prototype behaviors that are unlikely to be affected by BPAs are among the most frequently cited reasons for transfusion outside of the guidelines. Symptomatic anemia is a common, though subjective, indication for blood transfusion. With a wide range of individually uncommon justifications for transfusion behavior, the secondary use of electronic medical record databases and integrated CDS tools is essential for efficiently analyzing common practice behaviors.",0,0,
2008,Why we still do arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis: a multi-method study,"BACKGROUND: Knee arthroscopy has historically been a common treatment for knee osteoarthritis. However, multiple Randomized Controlled Trials, combined with a Cochrane review, have led NICE to recommend that arthroscopy not be used in the vast majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis. These recommendations have been replicated internationally. The use of arthroscopy in knee osteoarthritis has decreased"";"" but still common. This study examines the factors thought to influence decision making using a theoretical framework (The Theoretical Domains Framework) developed for behavior change research. This work will allow future studies to develop and evaluate an intervention that specifically targets identified barriers. METHODS: A multimodal approach was used, including survey research and semi-structured interviews with physicians of all degrees providing knee arthroscopy services at the Primary Trauma Center in the West Midlands, UK. Focus groups were also held with patients. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data, and thematic content analysis and mixed method analysis were used for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 26 surgeons answered the questionnaires with 6 semi-structured interviews. All surgical grades were represented. Two focus groups consisting of six patients were applied. Results identified 13 beliefs across 12 domains (some beliefs were represented across domains). The belief that there is pressure from patients to do something, other options are limited, surgeons want to meet patients' expectations, and time pressure in the clinic emerged as dominant barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, this article identified relevant barriers and facilitators in the implementation of the NICE guideline on the use of arthroscopy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The next step in this process is the development of a targeted intervention, and we discuss the barriers most likely to change practice if targeted through an intervention, and what such an intervention might look like. Such an intervention will require evaluation in a clinical setting.",0,0,
2009,Why don't women ask for information about pre-pregnancy health? a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Preconception care includes health promotion to reduce risk factors that may affect women and couples of childbearing age. Risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes include family or individual recognized genetic diseases, previous congenital diseases, miscarriage, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, infertility, chronic maternal diseases, lifestyle, and occupational or environmental factors. Effective preconception care includes a range of preventive, therapeutic and behavioral interventions. Although there are national recommendations for preconception care for the general population in Italy, they are often promoted informally and only for single risk factors. There is currently a growing interest in offering a global response in this area. The aim of this study is to examine the attitudes and behaviors of Italian women of childbearing age and health professionals towards pre-pregnancy health. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among women of childbearing age and health professionals between February 2014 and February 2015. Five focus groups were conducted: 2 with non-pregnant women aged 22-44 and 3 with healthcare professionals. Discussion topics are women's questions about pre-pregnancy health, concerns and barriers to pre-pregnancy care interventions, attitudes and behaviors of women and health professionals towards pre-pregnancy health, and women's information resources. In the analysis of focus groups, priority was given to what women said, supported by information from focus groups of health professionals. RESULTS: 14 women of childbearing age (8 nulliparous and 6 multiparous) and 12 healthcare professionals (3 nurses, 4 midwives, 5 doctors) participated in the focus groups. The results demonstrate the existence of many barriers to women, health professionals and policy and the lack of pre-pregnancy health awareness. The knowledge and attitudes of women towards primary pre-pregnancy care information are explained. For Italian women, the main source of information in this field seems to be obstetricians and gynecologists. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that various barriers affect preconception care in Italy. There is also a lack of awareness of pre-pregnancy health and care among Italian women of childbearing age and health professionals. The findings may contribute to strategies for implementing preconception care guidelines.",0,0,
2010,Perspectives of WIC providers in offering smoking cessation interventions,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the perspectives of WIC clinical providers on offering smoking cessation interventions to pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four focus groups of WIC nurses, dietitians, and social workers (N = 25) were conducted at WIC clinics in eastern Iowa. The researchers developed discussion guides to determine how WIC providers currently approach pregnant women who smoke and what they consider barriers to providing effective smoking cessation interventions. Code matching was used to analyze focus group discussions. RESULTS: Factors influencing the ability of WIC staff to provide smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women included time available, clinical priorities, staff approaches to clients, and staff training. Additionally, providers have expressed concerns about additional customer issues that prevent smoking cessation alongside educational materials for customers. The absence of mechanisms to monitor clinical outcomes related to smoking cessation was also noted. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS: WIC providers have time limits that may require minimal or low-intensity interventions to quit smoking, but did not know such approaches were truly effective. WIC providers need more education on the whole topic of smoking cessation to be more proactive in their attempts to help pregnant women quit. To motivate staff to intervene, training should be initiated to increase self-efficacy and understanding of the impact of smoking on mothers, infants and children. Another strategy to motivate WIC staff could be to monitor clinical outcomes in helping women quit smoking or prevent relapse.",0,0,
2011,Will mothers of sick children help their husbands quit smoking with a brief intervention from nurses? Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard for children. Clinical guidelines recommend that nurses advise smoking parents to stop smoking when accompanying their sick child to pediatric settings, but the guidelines do not mention what nurses can do if the parents are not present. This study examines the effectiveness of a low-intensity, nurse-led health education initiative in motivating non-smoking mothers to take action to help their husbands quit smoking. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial and enrolled 1,483 non-smoking women living with their sick children while on admission to the general pediatric wards/outpatient departments of four hospitals in Hong Kong. Women were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The first received brief health education consultations from nurses, a purposeful health education booklet, a ""no smoking"" label, and a phone call a week later"";"" control group received usual care. The primary outcome was women's action in helping their smoking husbands quit smoking at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-ups. husbands quit smoking at 3 months (76% vs. 65%, P < .001), 6 months (66% vs. 49%, P < .001), and 12 months (52% vs. 40%, P < .001) Women who received the intervention, had better knowledge of the health hazards of smoking, had higher intention to take precautions, and perceived their husbands' willingness to quit/reduce smoking had previously advised their husbands to smoke. The smoker was aware of her husband's smoking history and that her husband had tried to quit before and aimed to help them quit smoking in the follow-ups. It can be effective in motivating mothers of sick children to take action to help their husbands quit smoking. It recommends adding the following to clinical practice guidelines on the treatment of tobacco use and addiction: 'Nurses should provide concise advice to every non-smoking mother of a sick child to encourage their husbands to quit smoking'.

2012,Words matter: increasing the application of clinical guidelines.,"Objectives: To determine whether writing clinical guideline recommendations in behaviorally determined ""plain English"" language increases the likelihood that they will be implemented by service users (patients). Design: Randomized controlled trial in which participants received either the original text of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) general guidelines on the management of schizophrenia or a behaviorally determined text with the same content. Setting: Mental health service user networks and voluntary sector organizations in two inner London boroughs. Participants: 84 mental health service users recruited by mail or face-to-face communication at service user meetings. Intervention: Section of public guidelines on psychological and pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia has been rewritten to improve style and behavioral specificity by applying evidence-based and psychologically informed principles of good written communication. Outcome measures: As indicated by the evidence-based theory of planned behavior, cognitive predictors of behavior constituted the primary outcome as it was not possible to measure the actual behavior of guide application. The predictors were behavioral intentions to implement instructions, attitudes towards implementation, and perceived behavioral control over implementation. Satisfaction with the guidelines and perceived understanding were also measured. Results: Behaviorally specified “plain English” directions led to stronger intentions to follow directions, more positive attitudes toward them, and greater perceived behavioral control over their use. There was no difference in satisfaction or perceived understanding. Conclusions: Writing guidelines with high behavioral specificity combined with the use of ""plain English"" can be a simple and effective way to increase their implementation. Evaluation with a behavioral outcome is now needed.",0,1,

METHODS: Beginning in February 2003, a consortium of doctors and allied health professionals from across the state of Georgia began meeting frequently to formulate a plan to improve the care of hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia. The immediate goals of DSIG were the identification and organization of relevant stakeholders, the development of consensus model clinical guidelines, and the dissemination of information. RESULTS: Since its inception, DSIG has accomplished: the development of 7 consensus sample clinical guidelines, the creation of a Web site that publishes these clinical guidelines and other useful relevant information and educational materials, and sponsorship of workshops across the state of Georgia. CONCLUSION: As the importance of glucose control in the hospital setting is increasingly recognized, institutions must find ways to apply the results of clinical trials to ""real world"" hospital settings. DSIG is an example of successful collaboration that can serve as a model for other public hospital organizations that want to develop programs to improve the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.",0,0,

2018,Young people receiving orthodontic care are not immune to poor diet and overweight: a call for dentists to join prevention efforts,"OBJECTIVES: While obesity is prevalent in the United States, inequalities exist. It is assumed that orthodontic specimens are wealthier than the general population and do not need assistance in developing or maintaining healthy lifestyles. This article evaluates the need of the orthodontic population for intervention by examining the diet and weight status of a sample of orthodontic patients and describes the role of dentists in obesity prevention efforts. METHODS: 552 patients, 54% female, 51% non-Hispanic white, 26% Hispanic, aged 8-14 years, were recruited from orthodontic practices in Southern California to participate in a clinician-provided randomized controlled trial of health promotion. Height, weight, demographic information and diet were recorded. Chi-square analyzes were used to test for baseline differences by gender, age, ethnicity, and income. RESULTS: 13% of the sample were overweight and 9% were obese. The obesity rate in men was higher than in women. The proportion of low-income youth was higher than that of high-income youth. The proportion of Hispanic youth was higher than that of non-Hispanic white youth. Non-compliance with national dietary guidelines was common and differed significantly by demographic group. RESULTS: In a sample not typically thought to need help, about 25% were overweight or obese, and the majority did not meet dietary recommendations. While most patients could benefit from the intervention, male, Hispanic, and lower-income groups were the ones most in need of help. Dentists who see young people frequently and discuss nutrition in the context of oral health have the opportunity to contribute to the prevention of obesity.",0,0,
2019,Systematic Scoping Review of the Choice Architecture Movement: Toward Understanding When and Why Nudges Work,"In this paper, we present an overall coverage review of the nudge action domain, reviewing 422 choice architecture interventions in 156 empirical studies. To review the current state of the nudge movement, we report the distribution of studies across countries, years, domains, sub-areas of applicability, types of interventions, and moderators associated with each intervention category. We also highlight certain features of studies and experimental and reporting practices that may hinder the accumulation of evidence in the field. Specifically, we found that 74% of studies were primarily motivated to assess the effectiveness of interventions in a particular setting, while only 24% of studies focused on investigating moderators or underlying processes. We also observed that only 7% of the studies applied power analysis, 2% used guidelines aimed at improving reporting quality, no studies were pre-registered in our database, and the intervention terminologies used were not comprehensive and often had overlapping categories. Based on our current observations and proposed solutions from other fields, we provide directly applicable recommendations for future research to support the body of evidence on why and when impulses work.",0,1,
