1,"A prospective, controlled study of a pharmacy-controlled warning system to increase thrombosis prophylaxis rates in inpatients.","Although venous thromboembolism is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality, a significant proportion of inpatients at risk do not receive interventions known to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a pharmacy-controlled alarm system would be associated with a higher rate of adequate measures for venous thromboembolism prevention in inpatients at risk in a general internal medicine service compared to usual care. The study was a prospective, controlled study conducted at a university teaching hospital. The participants were adults who were admitted to the general inpatient internal medicine service from June 19 to September 21, 2006 (Monday to Friday). Her treatment included a pharmacist assessment of venous thromboembolism risk and pharmacist-driven notification to the treating physician. The proportion of risk patients who received adequate thrombosis prophylaxis within 36 hours of admission was recorded. A total of 140 patients had a sufficient risk of venous thromboembolism to be included. In the normal care group, prophylactic measures were ordered in 49 (61%) of the 80 patients with intermediate to high risk. In the pharmacist warning group, 44 (73%) of the 60 patients with an intermediate to high risk of venous thromboembolism received adequate thromboprophylaxis (p = 0.15). Although we did not observe a statistically significant difference between groups, our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that alert systems can increase the proportion of hospitalized patients receiving adequate venous thromboembolism prevention measures.",0,1,
2,Effect of a clinical pharmacy service on lipid control in patients with peripheral arterial disease.,"Aim Our group and others have previously found that patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are significantly undertreated despite national guidelines to the contrary regarding overall management of cardiovascular risk factors. To maximize risk factor control in our patients with PAD, we established a pharmacist-managed, physician-supervised algorithmic approach to outpatient lipid management in patients with PAD. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of this service on lipid screening and control in patients with PAD. Methods We analyzed the records of patients treated in a large non-profit regional group model managed care system serving approximately 405,000 members. An electronic patient file provided complete examination, laboratory and pharmacy data for all patients. Pharmacy data were analyzed to determine the prescription of lipid-lowering drugs. Lipid control was assessed using fasting lipid data. Patients with validated PAD and no clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) were offered the service between May 2003 and September 2004 and followed up for at least 6 months. Results We administratively identified 5159 active patients with a diagnosis of PAD. Of these, 1075 could be validated with a non-invasive arterial study. The exclusion of 384 patients with CAD diagnosis resulted in a cohort of 691 patients. Of these, 90 patients were enrolled in the lipid service (study group) and 601 received standard care. The mean follow-up time was 17.1 months. Screening fasting lipid profiles were found in 95.6% (86/90) of patients in the study group and only 66.9% (402/601) of standard of care patients (p<0.0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control was improved in the pharmacist-guided group, with 79.1% (68/86) achieving LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL compared to the standard of care group (54 .8% [219/400]"";"" P<0.0001). LDL-C greater than 130 mg/dL was found in 1.2% and 14.0% (56/400) in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P<0.001). Statins were used in 51.9% (312/601) of patients in the control group and 84.4% (76/90) of the pharmacist-led group (P<0.001). Conclusions Despite national consensus on PAD as a CAD equivalent, patients are currently undertreated with regard to modification of atherosclerotic risk factors. The introduction of a pharmacist-led, physician-supervised lipid service improves compliance with national guidelines",0,1,
3,Using peer feedback to improve handwashing and glove use among Thai healthcare workers.,"Background: Without protective practices such as universal precautions, healthcare workers are at significant risk of blood-borne infection, particularly in areas such as Thailand with a high prevalence of HIV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer feedback program (PFP) on hand washing and glove wearing (HW/GW) among Thai healthcare workers. METHODS: Subjects (N = 91) were randomly assigned to PFP versus no treatment. Using a checklist, peer observers assessed their staff's HW/GW compliance during patient care. For 1 month, the investigator published a report on the compliance behavior of each 3 observation days. HW/GW was also assessed by the investigator through direct observation 1 month before the intervention, during the intervention period, and 1 month after the intervention. Results: The baseline HW/GW rates for the PFP and control groups were 49.2% and 61.5%, respectively. The PFP group had a significantly higher adjusted compliance rate than the control group during the intervention period (p=0.0001). However, there was no significant difference in the compliance scores obtained 1 month after the intervention. Conclusions: The PFP was effective throughout the intervention period, but there was no retention of effect. Therefore, complementary methods should be sought to promote maintenance of the effect.

6,"""Do no harm"": Legal guidelines for health programs for youth aged 10 to 17 who sell sex or inject drugs","INTRODUCTION: There is a strong evidence base that the stigma, discrimination and criminalization affecting key youth populations (KPs) aged 10-17 years is amplified due to national and international legal constructs that rely on law enforcement-based interventions ranging from arrest, Previous convictions Pre-trial detention, imprisonment and forced ""rehabilitation"" in institutional accommodation. Although there are evidence-based and rights-based technical guidelines for interventions in older cohorts, these guidelines have not yet been adopted by international public health stakeholders due to concerns that international law may have different standards for adolescents aged 10-17 who engage in behavior such as selling sex or injecting drugs. DISCUSSION: For reasons of international human rights, health, juvenile justice and child protection law, interventions among juvenile CPs aged 10-17 years must not involve arrest, prosecution or detention of any kind. It is imperative that interventions do not rely on law enforcement but rather on low-threshold, voluntary services, shelter and support, using as much peer outreach as possible. These services must be mobile, accessible, and allow for alternatives to parental consent for the delivery of life-saving support, including HIV testing, treatment and care, needle and syringe programs, opioid substitution therapy, safe abortions, antiretroviral therapy, and gender-affirming care and hormone treatment for transgender people -Teens. To ensure registration for services, international guidelines indicate that informed consent and confidentiality must be guaranteed, including the waiver of parental consent requirements. To discourage healthcare practitioners and researchers from dealing with juvenile KPs aged 10 to 17, government agencies and ethical review bodies are encouraged to grant exceptions or exemptions from reporting requirements. If authorities attempt to involuntarily institutionalize juvenile CPs in violation of international law and guidelines, they are entitled to a judicial process. Legal guidelines also provide that these juveniles have control over their placement, access to legal counsel to challenge the conditions of their detention and regular visits from peers, friends and family members, and that all facilities are subject to frequent and regular independent audits. including community-based groups led by KPs. CONCLUSIONS: The scrutiny of international law states that protective interventions for KPs aged 10-17 must not only include low-threshold, voluntary services, but also “protect” juvenile KPs from the harms associated with law enforcement-based interventions. Going forward, health workers must respect the right to health by adapting programs according to the principles of minimum intervention, due process and proportionality, and duly limiting the involvement of juvenile justice and child protection as a last resort, where they exist.",0,0,
7,"""How much do you get paid if I volunteer?"" Proposed Institutional Policies on Reward, Consent, and Research","Pharmaceutical companies often ask practicing physicians to conduct phase IV or post-marketing research on new drugs. Companies pay doctors to enroll their patients and report information on dosages and side effects. Postmarketing research involves a multibillion-dollar effort to fund and educate, but informed consent from subjects does not typically include medical rewards. Improving the investigators' financial situation while increasing the medical risks for phase IV subjects is ethically unacceptable, especially when the investigators are unaware of the investigators' rewards. We propose a model policy and guidelines that reaffirm subjects' need for education, investigators' need for recognition and support, and institutions' need to protect patients from undisclosed risks and relationships.",0,0,

We used a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design to explain the results of an academic intervention study in the inpatient medical units of four Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals. We interviewed 164 nurses and conducted semi-structured interviews with a targeted sample of 33 nurses with different attitudes towards exit counseling. Content analysis was used to inductively characterize the questions raised by the participants. Emerging issues were categorized using the knowledge-attitude-behaviour framework of compliance. Knowledge and attitudinal barriers included the perceived lack of skills in cessation counseling and skepticism about the effectiveness of cessation policies among hospital veterans. Nurses also reported several behavioral and organizational barriers to guideline compliance: patient resistance, insufficient time and resources, the presence of smoking areas on VA premises, and a lack of coordination with primary care. VA hospitals should train inpatient staff to negotiate behavior changes, integrate cessation counseling into the caregiver workflow, develop alternative referral mechanisms for cessation counseling after discharge, and adopt hospital policies to promote inpatient abstinence.",0,0,

11,(S)Partners for Heart Health: a school-based program to improve physical activity and nutrition to promote cardiovascular health in 5th grade students,"BACKGROUND: The American Heart Association Position Statement on Promoting Cardiovascular Health in Public Schools promotes school-based interventions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through risk factor prevention or reduction in children, with an emphasis on creating an environment that promotes healthy eating and physical activity (PA). To address issues associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including childhood obesity in Michigan, a multidisciplinary team of Michigan State University (MSU) health care faculty, clinicians and students was formed to “(S)partner” with undergraduate medicine are joining Education (PE) Teachers and MSU Extension Staff to develop and implement a cost-effective, sustainable program aimed at prevention and management of CVD risk factors for 5th grade students. This (S)partnership aims to expand and improve the existing 5th grade physical education, health and nutrition curriculum by achieving the following objectives: 1) Improving students' knowledge, attitudes and confidence in relation to nutrition, physical education and heart health; 2) increasing the number of students who meet national recommendations for physical activity and diet;” and 3) increasing the number of students with a desirable CVD risk factor status based on national pediatric guidelines. Secondary goals include school staff advancement and parental heart health support to help children achieve their goals and to provide experiential learning and services to MSU health care students for academic credit. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot efficacy study was approved by the MSU IRB. At the beginning and end of the school year, students undergo a CVD risk factor assessment conducted by MSU medical and graduate students. Key intervention components include eight lesson plans (delivered every two months) designed to promote heart-healthy eating and exercise behaviors, delivered by physical education teachers with support from MSU students in dietetics and kinesiology (Spartners). During the last 10 minutes of each lesson, MSU Spartners conduct small breakout/discussion groups with the 5th grade students. Additionally, each Spartner case manages/supervises two to three 5th grade students using a web-based goal setting and tracking protocol throughout the school year. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the rationale, development and methods of the Spartners for Heart Health program. This is a multi-step intervention aimed at promoting heart-healthy behaviors and preventing or managing cardiovascular risk factors in children. By including college students as an integral part of measurement and intervention teams, we believe this will be a viable sustainable intervention that can be disseminated and adopted by other institutions at minimal cost.",0,0,

13,100 apples divided by 15 red herrings: A cautionary tale from the mid-19th century comparing hospital mortality rates,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially when compared to provincial institutions. She backed up this claim with statistics published in William Fair's Registrar-General report, claiming that 24 London hospitals had mortality rates in excess of 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr had calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died over the year by the number of patients hospitalized on a single day. Calculated as the annual number of deaths divided by the total number of inpatients during the year, the mortality rate in London hospitals was 10%. A heated debate broke out in the London medical press about how best to calculate mortality rates in hospitals. Critics claimed Farr failed to adjust for differences in the severity of the disease between urban and rural hospitals and that his numbers mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale, in turn, criticized the poor quality of the hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics used to compare vendor quality.",0,0,

15,2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Management Guideline: A paradigm shift in managing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,"The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on managing blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults represents a significant change from previous guidelines on cholesterol management. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive Meta-analyses and introduce several important paradigm shifts, including: targeting ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first-line therapy, and using a new risk calculator and risk cut-off to to guide the initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have caused controversy and confusion in the medical community, with some clinicians reluctant to embrace the change. We review the evidence that underpins these major changes, compares it to other important lipid guidelines, and recommends an integrated approach to treating dyslipidemia to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",0,0,
16,2015 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats,"Rationale: The significant advances in the management of pain in companion animals underpin the decision by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) and the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) to expand the information provided in the 2007 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines. The 2015 guidelines summarize much of this new knowledge and provide a differentiated overview. RELEVANCE: Pain management is central to the veterinary practice as it reduces pain, improves patient outcomes and improves both the quality of life and the vet-patient relationship. These guidelines support veterinarians to integrate pain management into practice and improve patient care. APPROACHES: Management of pain requires continuous care that includes anticipation, early intervention, and assessment of response on an individual patient basis. A team-oriented approach that involves the owner is essential to maximize the detection, prevention and treatment of pain in animals. Evidence base: The guidelines include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities for pain management, they are evidence-based as far as possible and otherwise represent a consensus of expert opinion. Behavioral changes are currently the main indicator of pain and its course or progression and the basis for recently validated pain Scores. Postoperative pain is highly predictable, but there is strong evidence supporting strategies to mitigate both adaptive and maladaptive forms. Chronic pain is dominated by degenerative joint disease (DJD), one of the most significant and underdiagnosed diseases in felines and dogs. DJD is ubiquitous, occurs in pets of all ages and inevitably progresses over time."" Evidence-based management strategies are established in dogs and emerging in cats.",0,0,
17,5As a team intervention in obesity in primary care: development and evaluation of shared decision-making tools for weight management,"Despite multiple clinical practice guidelines, a significant gap in the prevention and management of obesity in primary care remains. To address the need to change provider behavior, a convergent mixed-method evaluation randomized controlled trial, the 5As Team (5AsT) trial, was conducted. The 5AsT toolkit was developed as part of the 5AsT intervention. This paper describes the development process and the evaluation of these tools. The tools were co-developed by the multidisciplinary research team and the 5AsT, which included registered nurses (n=15), psychiatrists (n=7), and registered dietitians (n=7) who were previously randomized to the 5AsT intervention group in a primary care network in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The development of the 5AsT tool occurred through a hands-on/implementation-based, needs-based, iterative process during collaborative learning sessions of the 5AsT intervention. Feedback during tool development was obtained through field notes and final vendor evaluation was conducted through anonymous questionnaires. Twelve tools were developed together with 5AsT. All tools were rated by the 5AsT as either 'most useful' or 'moderately useful' in primary care practice. Four key learnings during the development of the 5AsT tool were the need for: tools that were adaptable, tools to facilitate interdisciplinary practice, tools to help patients understand realistic weight loss expectations, and tools for shared decision making for goal setting and relapse prevention. The 5AsT tools are primary care tools that extend the usefulness of the 5As of the obesity management framework in clinical practice.",0,0,
18,6-PACK Program to Reduce Fall Injuries in Acute Hospitals: Cluster-randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of the 6-PACK program on falls and fall injuries in acute care units. DESIGN cluster randomized controlled trial. SETTING Six Australian hospitals. PARTICIPANTS All patients admitted to 24 acute care units during the trial period. INTERVENTIONS Participating units were randomly assigned to either the nurse-led 6-PACK program or usual care over 12 months. The 6-PACK program included a fall risk tool and individual application of one or more of six interventions: “fall alert” sign, monitoring patients in the bathroom, ensuring patients' walkers are within reach, a toilet schedule, use of a Low-low bed and using a bed/chair alarm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The co-primary endpoints were falls and fall injuries per 1000 occupied bed days. RESULTS During the study, 46,245 admissions were made to 16 medical and eight surgical wards. Since many people were admitted more than once, these were 31,411 individual patients. Patient characteristics and length of stay were similar on the intervention and control wards. Utilization of the 6-PACK program components was higher in intervention wards than in control wards (incidence rate ratio 3.05, 95% confidence interval 2.14 to 4.34""; P<0.001). A total of 1831 falls and 613 fall injuries occurred, and the rates of falls (incidence rate ratio 1.04, 0.78 to 1.37; P=0.796) and fall injuries (0.96, 0.72 to 1.27; P=0.766) were similar at intervention and control wards.CONCLUSIONSPositive changes in fall prevention practice occurred after implementation of the 6-PACK program. However, no difference in falls or fall injuries was observed between groups. High-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions in acute care units remains lacking.

OncoDoc is a non-automated system that allows flexibility in interpreting guidelines to provide the best patient-specific recommendations at the point of care. OncoDoc is used to treat breast cancer. We tested the system at Institut Gustave Roussy with a before-and-after study measuring treatment decisions for breast cancer patients before and after using the system to assess its impact on physician prescribing behavior. After 4 months, 127 decisions were recorded. Physician compliance with OncoDoc was significantly improved (p < 10(-4) ) and reached 85.03% after using the system.

20,behavioral economics view of poverty,"Standard theories about poverty fall into two camps. Social scientists view the behavior of the economically disadvantaged either as a calculated adaptation to prevailing circumstances or as the result of a unique ""culture of poverty"" shaped by dissenting values. The first camp assumes that people are highly rational, that they have coherent and justified beliefs, and that they pursue their goals effectively, without error and without help. The second camp ascribes to the poor a variety of psychological and attitudinal deficiencies that often mislead their views and their decisions so that they need paternalistic leadership. We propose a third view. We argue that the behavioral patterns of the poor are neither perfectly calculating nor particularly deviant. Rather, the poor may exhibit the same fundamental weaknesses and prejudices as people in other walks of life, except that in poverty, with its low error rates, the same behaviors can often be more pronounced and lead to poorer outcomes. Below we illustrate the types of insights that might be gained from a behaviorally more realistic analysis of the economic conditions of the poor and propose these alternative measures",0,0,

24,"A case report on the evaluation of a large-scale health system improvement project in an uncontrolled setting: a quality improvement initiative in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","Objective New approaches are needed to assess quality improvement (QI) in large-scale public health efforts. This case report describes the challenges of a large-scale QI evaluation and proposes solutions based on an adaptive study design. Study Design We used two sequential assessment methods to examine a QI effort to improve HIV prevention care in public health facilities in three districts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa over a 3-year period. We initially used a cluster randomized controlled trial design (RCT). Main findings During the RCT study period, tensions arose between the intervention implementation and the evaluation design due to the loss of integrity of the randomization unit over time, the pressure to implement changes across the boundaries of the randomization unit, and the use of administrative rather than functional structures for randomization. In response to this loss of design integrity, we switched to a more flexible intervention design and a mixed-methods quasi-experimental assessment that relied on both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis with punctuated time series. Conclusions Cluster RCT designs may not be optimal for evaluating complex interventions to improve implementation in uncontrolled “real world” environments. More flexible, context-sensitive evaluation designs provide a better balance between the need to adjust the intervention during evaluation to address implementation challenges, while providing the data needed to evaluate effectiveness. Our case study was about HIV care in a resource-constrained setting, but these issues are likely to apply to complex improvement efforts in other settings.",0,0,
25,centralized cardiovascular risk service to improve compliance in private GP practices,"BACKGROUND: Many large healthcare systems now employ clinical pharmacists in team-based care to assist patients and physicians in managing cardiovascular disease (CV). However, small private offices often lack the resources to hire a clinical pharmacist for their office. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a centralized, web-based CV Risk Service (CVRS) managed by clinical pharmacists will improve adherence to guidelines in primary care physician offices in rural and small communities. METHODS: This study is a cluster-randomized prospective study in 12 primary care practices. Physician offices were randomized to either CVRS intervention or usual care. The intervention lasts 12 months and all subjects have research visits at baseline and 12 months. Primary outcomes include adherence to treatment guidelines and control of key cardiovascular risk factors. Data will also be collected from the medical record at 30 months to determine if the intervention effect persists after discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: This study will enroll subjects through 2015 and results will be available in 2018. This study will shed light on whether a remote, centralized CV risk service can improve adherence to guidelines in physician offices that lack the resources to employ clinical pharmacists.",0,1,
26,clinical decision support system for the prevention of venous thromboembolism: Implications for physician behavior,"CONTEXT: Computer-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been promoted for their potential to improve the quality of healthcare. However, given the limited range of clinical settings in which they have been tested, such systems must be rigorously evaluated prior to widespread introduction into clinical practice. AIM: To determine whether the provision of guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using a CDSS increases the proportion of appropriate decisions in clinical practice. DESIGN: Time series study conducted between December 1997 and July 1999. INSTITUTION: Department of Orthopedic Surgery of a teaching hospital in Paris, France. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1971 patients who underwent orthopedic surgery. INTERVENTION: A CDSS for the immediate provision of information on the prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients was integrated into daily medical practice during three 10-week intervention periods alternating with four 10-week control periods, with a 4-week washout between each period. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Proportion of appropriate anticoagulation prescriptions according to pre-established clinical guidelines during intervention vs. control periods. RESULTS: Physicians complied with the guidelines in 82.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.6% - 87.1%) of the cases during the control periods and in 94.9% (95% CI, 92.5% - 96.6%) of cases during intervention periods. Prescribing appropriateness increased significantly (P<0.001) during each intervention period. Each time the CDSS was removed, physician practice reverted to that observed before the intervention began. The relative risk of inappropriate treatment decisions during control vs. intervention periods was 3.8 (95% CI, 2.7-5.4). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, implementation of clinical guidelines for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis through a CDSS routinely used in an orthopedic surgery department and integrated into the hospital information system changed physician behavior and improved adherence to the guidelines.

27,clinical study of a knowledge-based medical record,"To meet the needs of general practitioners caring for patients with HIV infection, we have developed a knowledge-based medical record to allow the online medical record to play an active role in the care process. These programs integrate online patient record, rules-based decision support, and full-text information retrieval into a clinical workstation for the practicing clinician. To determine whether the use of a knowledge-based medical record was associated with faster and more complete adherence to practice guidelines and improved quality of care, we conducted a controlled clinical study of physicians and nurses caring for 349 patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)"";"" 191 patients were treated by 65 doctors and nurses in the intervention group and 158 patients by 61 doctors and nurses in the control group. During the 18-month study period, the computer generated 303 alerts in the intervention group and 388 in the control group. The median physician response time to these warnings was 11 days in the intervention group and 52 days in the control group (PJJ0.0001, log-rank test). During the study, the computer generated 432 primary care reminders for the intervention group and 360 reminders for the control group. The physicians' median response time to these warnings was 114 days in the intervention group and more than 500 days in the control group (PJJ0.0001, log-rank test). Of the 191 patients in the intervention group, 67 (35%) had one or more hospitalizations compared to 70 (44%) of the 158 patients in the control group (PJ=J0.04, Wilcoxon test, stratified for initial CD4 count). There was no difference in survival between the intervention and control groups (P=0.18, log-rank test). We conclude that our clinical workplace has significantly changed the behavior of physicians in their response to intervention alerts in primary care and that these interventions have resulted in fewer HIV-infected patients being hospitalized.",0,1,
28,clinically integrated postgraduate training program in evidence-based medicine versus no intervention for improving disability assessment: a clustered randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have shown that teaching EBM helps improve knowledge, there is currently no convincing evidence that teaching EBM also changes professional behavior in practice. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinically integrated postgraduate training program in EBM in the evidence-based assessment of disabilities. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cluster-randomized controlled study, 54 case-based study groups consisting of 132 physicians and 1680 patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group was offered a clinically integrated, postgraduate, 5-day Evidence-Based Medicine training program consisting of (home)work, peer teaching, interactive training in database searches, lectures, and brainstorming sessions. The control group received no training. The primary outcome was the evidence-based assessment of disability, as indicated by the frequency of use of evidence of sufficient quality in disability assessment reports. No general EBM behavioral outcome measures are available. Therefore, we followed general guidelines for the creation of performance indicators and defined a priori a threshold for determining sufficient quality as recommended for the evaluation of EB training. Physicians trained in EBM performed more evidence-based disability assessments compared to physicians in the control group (difference in absolute proportion 9.7%, 95% CI 3.5 to 15.9). The primary outcome differences between groups remained significant after both the cluster-adjusted analysis and additional sensitivity analyzes that accounted for subjects lost to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: An EBM program successfully improved the use of evidence in a medical specialty outside the hospital setting. Our results support the general recommendations to use multiple educational methods to change physician behavior. In addition, it appeared important that the professional context of the intervention was very supportive, in the sense that database searching, use and application of guidelines and other forms of evidence are considered common practice and encouraged by colleagues and management.",0,0,
29,clinic-based mammography intervention for inner-city women.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the effect of a clinically-based intervention program on the use of mammography by inner-city women.

PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50 to 74 years with at least one routine hospital visit (when a mammogram was due) during the study period were enrolled (n=314). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention program emphasized nurse involvement and included physician training, provider prompts, use of audiovisual and printed patient education materials, transportation assistance in the form of bus tickets, telephone or postcard reminders before appointments, and assistance with rescheduling appointments. Women in the control group received usual care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mammography completion within 8 weeks of clinic visits was significantly higher in intervention (49%) than control (22%) fixed women (p<0.001). These effects persisted after adjustment for possible confounders of age, race, health insurance coverage, and prior hospital experience with mammography (odds ratio 3.5: 95% confidence interval 1.9, 6.5). The intervention effect was modified by the type of insurance coverage and the history of mammography. The process evaluation found that bus passes and rebooking efforts did not contribute to the observed increases in screening attendance. CONCLUSIONS: A clinic-based program that includes physician education, physician prompts, patient education materials, and appointment reminders that emphasizes nursing involvement may facilitate compliance with breast cancer screening guidelines among inner-city women.",0,1,
30,"cluster-randomized controlled trial of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a ""whole system"" model of self-management support for the management of long-term illness in primary care: study protocol","Background Patients with long-term conditions are increasingly the focus of health care quality improvement efforts to reduce the impact of these conditions on quality of life and to reduce the burden of seeking care. There is significant interest in the potential of self-management support to improve health and reduce utilization in these patient populations, but there is little consensus on the optimal model that would best provide such support. We describe the implementation and evaluation of self-management support through an evidence-based ""whole system"" model that includes patient support, primary care team training, and service reorganization, all integrated into routine delivery within primary care. Methods The evaluation included a large-scale, multi-site study of the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this model of self-management support using a cluster-randomized controlled trial in patients with three long-term chronic obstructive diabetic pulmonary diseases (COPD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Outcome measures include health care utilization and quality of life. We describe the methods of the cluster-randomized study. Discussion If the “whole systems” model proves effective and cost-effective, it will provide decision-makers with a model for delivering self-management support to populations with long-term illnesses that can be widely implemented to maximize “reach” to the broader patient population.",0,0,
31,cluster-randomized clinical trial to improve prescribing patterns in outpatient pediatrics.,"Aims Having previously demonstrated that an electronic prescribing and decision support system improved pediatric prescribing behavior for otitis media in an academic clinical setting, we assessed whether providing evidence at the point of care demonstrates similar effects for a variety of other common pediatric conditions could . Design cluster randomized controlled trial. Surroundings A teaching hospital/clinical practice site and pediatric primary care hospital serving a rural and semi-urban mix of patients. Participants A total of 36 service providers in the teaching clinic/practice and eight service providers in the private children's primary clinic. Intervention An evidence-based messaging system that presents real-time evidence to physicians based on prescribing practices for acute otitis media, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, constipation, pharyngitis, croup, urticaria, and bronchiolitis. Outcome measures The proportion of prescriptions that are filled according to the evidence. Results The proportion of prescriptions issued in accordance with the evidence improved by four percentage points from 38% at baseline to 42% after the intervention. The control group improved by one percentage point from 39% at baseline to 40% at the end of the study. The adjusted difference between the intervention and control groups was 8% (95% confidence interval 1%, 15%). The effectiveness of the intervention did not decrease over time. Conclusion For common pediatric outpatient conditions, an evidence-based point-of-care prescription and decision support system has been associated with significant improvements in prescribing practice.",1,1,
32,cluster-randomized controlled trial aimed at implementing local quality improvement collaborations to improve primary care physician prescribing and trial ordering performance: study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The use of guidelines in general practice is suboptimal. Although evidence-based methods for improving guideline adherence are available, the variability in physician compliance with general treatment guidelines remains relatively high. The aim of this study is to translate into practice a quality improvement strategy based on audits, feedback, training materials and peer group discussions moderated by local opinion leaders. The research questions are: Will the multi-layered strategy be implemented on a large scale as planned? and what are the costs of implementing the strategy? Methods: To evaluate the effects, costs, and feasibility of this new strategy, we plan a multicenter randomized controlled cluster study (RCT) with a balanced incomplete block design. Local GP groups in the south of the Netherlands, which already participate in pharmacotherapeutic audit session groups, are being recruited by regional health officers. Approximately 50 groups of GPs will be randomly assigned to two arms. These GPs are offered two different balanced clinical themes. Each GP within a group receives comparative feedback on test ordering and prescribing performance. The feedback is discussed in the group and working agreements are made after discussing the guidelines and barriers to change. The data for the feedback will be collected both at the beginning and after one year from existing and newly formed databases. DISCUSSION: We are not aware of any published studies on the successes and failures of attempts to scale up a multi-faceted strategy targeting GP ordering and prescribing behavior to stakeholders in this area. This pragmatic study will focus on compatibility with existing infrastructure while allowing a degree of customization to local needs and routines.",0,0,
33,cluster-randomized study of improving standard quality versus patient-centered interventions to improve depression management for African Americans in primary care: study protocol NCT00243425,"BACKGROUND: Several studies document differences in access to and quality of care for African Americans for depression. Research suggests that patient attitudes and physician communication may contribute to these differences. Evidence links patient-centered care to improvements in mental health outcomes"";"" Therefore, quality improvement interventions that improve this dimension of care are promising strategies for improving depression treatment and outcomes in African Americans. This paper describes the design of the BRIDGE study (Blacks Receiving Interventions for Depression and Gaining Empowerment). The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two interventions for African American patients with depression - a standard quality improvement program and a patient-centered quality improvement program. The main hypothesis is that patients in the patient-centered group have greater reductions in their depression symptoms, higher depression remission rates, and greater mental health improvements than patients in the standard group at six, twelve, and eighteen months. The study also examines patient ratings of care and receipt of guideline-compliant treatment for depression. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 36 general practitioners and 132 of their African-American patients with major depression were recruited into a cluster-randomized study. The study uses intent-to-treat analyzes to compare the effectiveness of standard quality improvement interventions (academic details of depression guidelines for clinicians and disease-focused care management for their patients) and patient-centered quality improvement interventions (training communication skills to improve participation) in decision-making for Clinicians and care managers with a focus on explanatory models, sociocultural barriers, and treatment preferences for their patients) to improve outcomes over a 12-month period. DISCUSSION: The BRIDGE study includes physicians and African American patients in community practices with under-resources who have not been well represented in clinical trials designed to improve the treatment of depression. The patient-centered and culture-aligned approach to treating depression is relatively new and has not been tested in most previous studies. The study will provide evidence on whether patient-centered adjustments improve quality of care and outcomes to a greater extent than standard quality improvement strategies for African Americans with depression.

34,combined paging alert and web-based tool changes clinical behavior and shortens hospital stays in acute pancreatitis,"OBJECTIVES: There are many published clinical guidelines for acute pancreatitis (AP). The implementation of these recommendations varies. We hypothesized that a clinical decision support tool (CDS) would change clinical behavior and reduce length of stay in hospital (LOS). METHODS: DESIGN/SETTING: Observational study entitled The AP Early Response (TAPER) Project. Emergency Department (ED) and Tertiary Center Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two consecutive samples of patients with the ICD-9 code (577.0) for AP were generated from emergency department (ED) or hospital admissions. The diagnosis of AP was based on conventional Atlanta criteria. The pre-TAPER CDS tool group (05/30/06-06/22/07) had 110 patients who presented with AP per 976 ICD-9 (577.0) codes and the post-TAPER CDS tool group in presented to the emergency department (05/30/06 - 06/22/07) had 113 per 907 ICD-9 codes (07/14/10 - 05/05/11). INTERVENTION: The TAPER-CDS tool, developed 12/2008 to 14/07/2010, is a combined early, automated paging alert system that notifies ED clinicians of a patient with AP via SMS, and an intuitive web-based point-of- Care instrument consisting of seven recommendations for early management. RESULTS: The pre- vs. post-TAPER CDS tool groups had similar baseline characteristics. The post-TAPER CDS tool group achieved two management goals more frequently than the pre-TAPER CDS tool group: risk stratification (P6L/1.0-24 h (P=0.0003). Mean (SD) hospital LOS was significantly shorter in the post-TAPER CDS tool group (4.6 (3.1) vs. 6.7 (7.0) days, P=0.0126) Multivariate analysis identified four independent variables for length of hospital stay: the TAPER-CDS tool associated with shorter LOS (P=0.0049) and three variables associated with longer LOS: Japanese severity (P=0.0361), persistent organ failure (P=0.0088) and local pancreatic complications (<0.0001) CONCLUSIONS: The TAPER-CDS tool is associated with altered clinical behavior and reduced hospital length of stay, which has significant financial implications.",0,0,

36,A community-based approach to promoting breastfeeding in Mexico,"comprehensive education strategy is presented that combines training, community education, research and mass media efforts to improve breastfeeding practices. Breastfeeding promotion models, an administration system and experiences from the project are described. It has been shown that the keys to effective breastfeeding promotion are accurate information, adequate education, training and follow-up, and a supportive management system.; PIP: An operational research project aimed to determine which intervention model was most successful in promoting breastfeeding among 585 urban women in Mexico. Interventions have included trained promoters teaching and counseling breastfeeding mothers in Irapuato, program leaders teaching groups of mothers in Chihuahua, and both trained promoters and program leaders training individuals or groups in Cuauhtemoc. Jalapa served as a checkpoint. The pre-intervention rate of breastfeeding in the 4 communities varied between 64.5% and 81.3% with a mean in the target group of 74.9%. The mean for this group increased to 88.8% after the intervention. In addition, the breastfeeding prevalence rate for Jalapa fell from 65.9% to 56%. Furthermore, 70% of the women in the experimental group exclusively breastfed their infants at 1 month, while only 63.3% in the control group did so. The prevalence rates of breastfeeding in the following months decreased by 13.7% and 14.7% (5 months) and 9.4% and 3.3% (6 months) in the experimental and control groups, respectively. As a result of the educational and counseling activities, informal self-help groups of breastfeeding mothers unexpectedly formed. The data showed that the promoter intervention model was the most successful strategy. They also provided guidelines for researchers and other health professionals interested in promoting community-based breastfeeding programs. For example, supervisors should not discourage promoters from attending to other community needs, as discouragement may jeopardize their commitment to promoting breastfeeding. In addition, program planners should gather geographic and socio-demographic data of the area and population prior to planning and intervention.",0,0,
37,comparison of the effects of computer and manual reminders on adherence to a mental health clinical practice guideline.,"Aim: To evaluate the relative effectiveness of computer and manual reminder systems in implementing a clinical practice guideline. DESIGN: Seventy-eight outpatients in a psychiatric hospital were randomly assigned to one of the two memory systems within the clinician. The computer system, called CaseWalker, reminded clinicians when guideline-recommended screening for mood disorders was due and ensured that the diagnosis of major depressive disorder met the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM -IV), corresponds. and creates a progress bar. The manual system was a checklist that was inserted into the paper medical record. Measures: Screening rates for mood disorders and the completeness of documentation of which DSM-IV criteria were met by patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder were compared. Results: The CaseWalker resulted in a higher rate of screening for mood disorders (86.5 vs. 61 percent, P=0.008) and a higher rate of complete documentation of DSM-IV criteria (100 vs. 5, 6 percent, P<0.001). Conclusions: In a psychiatric outpatient clinic, computer reminders were shown to be superior to manual reminders in improving adherence to a clinical practice guideline for depression.",0,1,
38,computer-assisted intervention to improve the adequacy of monitoring antiepileptic drug levels,"We designed and implemented 2 automated, computerized screens for use at the time of entering the antiepileptic drug testing (AED) order to improve appropriateness by reminding physicians when a potentially redundant test has been ordered and general indications for monitoring and provide pharmacokinetics of the specific AED. All computerized prescriptions for stationary AED serum levels during two 3-month periods were included in the study. During the 3-month period after implementation of the automated intervention, 13% of all AED tests ordered were canceled following computerized reminders. For orders that appear superfluous, the cancellation rate was 27%. For non-redundant orders, 4% were canceled when information on specific AED monitoring and pharmacokinetics was provided. The cancellation rate was maintained after 4 years. Since the implementation of this measure, the overall volume of AED testing has decreased by 19.5%, although the overall volume of chemistry testing has increased by 19.3%. Inappropriateness due to repeated testing before reaching pharmacological steady state decreased from 54% of all AED prescriptions to 14.6%. A simple, automated, activity-based intervention targeting specific test ordering behavior effectively reduced inappropriate lab testing. The sustained benefit supports the notion that computer-assisted interventions can permanently influence physician behavior. The computerized delivery of such evidence-based borderline guidelines can help narrow the gap between evidence and practice.",1,1,
39,handheld computerized decision support system to improve the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: a randomized study.,"Background: The examination for pulmonary embolism often deviates from the recommendations of evidence-based guidelines. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a portable clinical decision support system to improve the diagnostic workup of suspected pulmonary embolism in patients in the emergency department. Design: Cluster randomized study. The allocation was made using a random number table, the providers were not blinded and the evaluation of the results was automated. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00188032) Environment: 20 emergency departments in France. Patients: 1103 and 1768 consecutive outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Intervention: After a pre-intervention phase involving 20 centers and 1103 patients, during which providers became accustomed to entering clinical data into wearable devices and investigators assessed baseline tests, emergency departments were randomized with activation of a decision support system commissioned on the devices (10 centers, 753 patients) or posters and pocket cards showing validated diagnostic strategies (10 centers, 1015 patients). Measurements: Adequacy of diagnostic work-up, defined as any set of tests that result in a post-test probability of less than 5% or greater than 85% (primary outcome) or strict adherence to guideline recommendations (secondary outcome)""; number of tests per patient (secondary endpoint). Results: The proportion of patients who received an adequate diagnosis was greater in both groups during the study than in the preintervention period, but the increase was larger in the group with computer-guided guidelines (adjusted mean difference in increase, 19.3 percentage points in favor of computer-guided guidelines [95% CI, 2.9 to 35.6 percentage points]; p=0.023) Among patients with adequate work-up, those in the computer-guided guide group received slightly fewer tests than did patients in the paper guideline group (mean tests per patient, 1.76 [SD, 0.98] vs. 2.25 [SD, 1.04]; ""PÂ < 0.001). Limitation: The study was not designed to show a difference in patients' clinical outcomes during follow-up. Conclusion: A wearable decision support system improved diagnostic decision making for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism in the emergency department.",0,1,
40,computer-assisted intervention to reduce calcium channel blocker use in hypertension.,"Aim To determine whether computerized reminder would change prescribing habits for the treatment of hypertension in accordance with current clinical guidelines in a general internal medicine clinic. Design A randomized study. Establishment of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health System General Internal Medicine Clinic, Seattle Division. Patients/participants Clinic providers were randomly assigned to a control group (n=35) or intervention group (n=36). We targeted providers of patients treated for hypertension with calcium channel blockers, a class of drugs not recommended for first line therapy. Intervention An automated computer query identified eligible patients and their providers. A policy reminder has been included in the medical records of intervention providers"";"" the medical records of the control providers received no reminder. Measurements and Main Results During the 5-month study period, 346 patients were treated by the 36 primary care physicians (staffed physicians, nurses, residents and fellows) in the intervention group and 373 patients by the 35 providers in the control group. Intervention providers switched to other medications in 39 patients (11.3%) during the study period compared to 1 patient (<1.0%) in control providers (p<0.0001). In patients with unchanged therapy, physicians found angina pectoris in 23.1%, indications other than hypertension in 9.5%, intolerable side effects in first-line therapy in 13.9%, and inadequate control in first-line therapy in 13.9% . Of the patients with no physician-reported contraindications, 23.6% were switched from calcium channel blockers to first-line drugs during the intervention period. Conclusions The use of a computer-assisted, clinically-based intervention increased adherence to guidelines in the management of primary hypertension in general and decreased the use of calcium channel blockers to treat hypertension in particular.",1,1,
41,computerized reminder for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis in surgical patients,"AIM: To measure the effect of a computerized reminder system on the rate of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in surgical patients. DESIGN: A prospective study to measure change in compliance compared to historical controls. MEASUREMENTS: LDS hospital surgeons developed a local consensus on which procedures should have DVT prophylaxis. The historical rate of prophylaxis for the procedures was measured by a database search of patient records. A computerized reminder system was then implemented, utilizing an expert knowledge base and a time drive mechanism to flag surgical cases for DVT prophylaxis. A DVT reminder appeared in the surgical plan for eligible patients"";"" The surgical staff used this as a guide for the use of prophylaxis. During the 3-month study, the rate of DVT prophylaxis was re-measured and compared to the pre-intervention rate. RESULTS: The preintervention rate of DVT prophylaxis over 3 months was 85.2% (785 of 921 eligible cases). In the 3 months following the introduction of computer-assisted reminders, adherence to DVT prophylaxis increased to 99.3% (1084 of 1092 eligible cases). The difference between historical controls and study participants was highly significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A computer-assisted reminder is an effective method to increase DVT prophylaxis rates in surgical patients.",1,1,
42,computerized reminder system to increase the use of preventive care for hospitalized patients,"BACKGROUND Although effective in outpatient settings, computerized reminders have not been shown to improve preventive care in inpatient settings. METHODS We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine the impact of computerized reminders on the rates at which four preventive therapies were ordered for inpatients. During an 18-month study period, a computerized system processed online information for all 6,371 patients admitted to a general medical service (for a total of 10,065 hospitalizations) and generated preventive reminders where appropriate. Physicians who were in the intervention group viewed these memories when using a computerized system to enter instructions for inpatients. RESULTS The reminder system identified 3416 patients (53.6 percent) as eligible for preventive care not ordered by the admitting physician. In patients with at least one indication, computer-assisted reminders resulted in higher adjusted order rates for pneumococcal vaccine (35.8 percent of patients in the intervention group vs. 0.8 percent of patients in the control group, P<0.001), influenza vaccine (51, 4 percent vs. 1.0 percent, P<0.001), prophylactic heparin (32.2 percent vs. 18.9 percent, P<0.001), and prophylactic aspirin at discharge (36.4 percent vs. 27.6 percent, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS A majority of the hospitalized patients in this study were eligible for preventive interventions, and computerized reminders significantly increased the delivery rate of such therapies.",1,1,
43,concept for the implementation and evaluation of the guideline “Early Breast Cancer Detection in Germany”,"Systematically developed, evidence- and consensus-based guidelines are important tools for improving healthcare. The effectiveness of a guideline relates not only to its methodological quality, but also to the implementation strategy used. The following article describes the systematic development of a strategy for the implementation and evaluation of the guideline “Early Breast Cancer Detection in Germany” as part of a national project. A multi-faceted systematic implementation strategy was developed that addresses existing barriers and builds on projects recently launched in Germany to improve breast cancer screening and treatment. The aim is to bring about behavioral changes in women as service recipients and doctors as service providers, both of whom are involved in the medical decision-making process within the framework of the guideline. In addition, it supports organizational changes to ensure compliance with the guideline through quality assurance and quality management. In order to ensure the evaluation of the implementation process, a number of quality indicators were identified for the baseline evaluation of structures, provider performance and results. Both the effectiveness of the implementation process and the effectiveness of the guideline itself are measured using the same indicators for reassessment within a predefined time interval of 18 months. The quasi-experimental design of this uncontrolled before-after implementation study outlined in the present work enables the assessment of clinically relevant changes using quality indicators that measure the effectiveness of the guideline at the national level.",0,0,
44,controlled study to incorporate symptom data into computer-aided treatment proposals for the management of patients with chronic heart failure,"Background Heart failure is common and associated with significant morbidity and expense, yet physician adherence to treatment guidelines is suboptimal. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether adding symptom information to evidence-based, computer-generated treatment proposals would affect treatment decisions of primary care physicians treating outpatients with heart failure at two Veterans Affairs medical centers. Methods Physicians were randomly assigned treatment proposals generated with electronic medical record data and symptom data from questionnaires mailed to patients within 2 weeks of scheduled outpatient visits (intervention group) or proposals generated with electronic medical record data only were (control group). Patients were required to have a diagnosis of heart failure and objective evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We assessed physician adherence to heart failure guidelines, as well as New York Heart Association (NYHA) patient class, quality of life, satisfaction with care, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment. Results The patients in the intervention (n = 355) and control groups (n = 365) were similar at baseline. At 12 months, there were no significant differences in adherence to treatment recommendations between physicians in the intervention and control groups (33% vs. 30%, P=0.4). There were also no significant changes in NYHA class (P = 0.1) and quality of life measures (P > 0.1), and no differences in the number of outpatient visits between intervention and control patients (6.7 vs 7.1 visits, P=0.48). Intervention patients were more satisfied with their physicians (P = 0.02) and primary care visit (P = 0.02), but had more hospitalizations for all reasons at 6 months (1.5 vs. 0.7 hospitalizations, P = 0.0002) and 12 months (2.3 vs 1.7 hospital admissions, P=0.05). Conclusion Adding symptom information to computer-generated treatment proposals for heart failure patients did not impact physician treatment decisions or improve patient outcomes.",0,1,
45,controlled study of web-based diabetes disease management.,"OBJECTIVE – To test the impact of a web-based decision support tool, the Diabetes Disease Management Application (DMA), designed to improve evidence-based management of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We conducted a randomized controlled group study involving 12 intervention and 14 control staff providers and 307 intervention and 291 control patients with type 2 diabetes in an internal medicine clinic. Providers were randomly assigned to have access to the DMA (intervention) or not (control) from May 1998 to April 1999. The DMA displays interactive patient-specific clinical data, treatment advice, and links to other web-based care resources. We compared patients in the intervention and control groups for changes in processes and treatment outcomes from the pre-study year to the study year by intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS - The DMA was used for 42% of scheduled patient visits. The number of HbA1c tests performed per year increased significantly in the intervention group (+0.3 tests/year) compared to the control group (-0.04 tests/year, P=0.008), as did the number of LDL cholesterol tests ( intervention, +0.2 tests/year""; control, +0.01 tests/year; P = 0.02) and the proportions of patients undergoing at least one foot examination per year (intervention, +9.8%; control, -0.7%; P=0.003) of HbA1c decreased by 0.2 in the intervention group and increased by 0.1 in the control group (p=0.09);"" The proportion of patients with LDL-C < 130 mg/dl increased by 20.3% in the intervention group and by 10.5% in the control group (p=0.5) CONCLUSIONS—Web-based, patient-specific decision support has the potential to improve evidence-based parameters of diabetes care.",0,1,
46,cross-sectional study of the number and frequency of terms used in a body of health literature to refer to knowledge translation in 2006: a Tower of Babel?,"The study of putting research results into practice is growing rapidly and has acquired many competing names (e.g. dissemination, uptake, exploitation, translation) and contributing disciplines. The interdisciplinary use of several terms impedes communication and progress in the application of research results. In a collection of health literature published in 2006, we attempted to create an inventory of terms that describe this area and how often authors use them. Methods We refer to this area as knowledge translation (KT). Terms describing aspects of KT and their definitions have been collected from literature, the internet, reports, textbooks and contact with experts. We compiled a database of KT and other articles by reading 12 health journals representing multiple disciplines. All articles published in these journals in 2006 were categorized as KT or not. The KT articles (all KT) were further categorized, where possible, according to whether they described KT projects or implementations (KT application articles) or presented the theoretical foundations, models, tools, methods or techniques of KT (KT theory articles ). Accuracy was checked by double reading. Custom software determined how often KT terms were used in the titles and abstracts of articles categorized as KT. Results A total of 2,603 articles were evaluated and 581 identified as KT articles. Of these, 201 described KT applications and 153 contained KT theory. Of the 100 KT terms collected, 46 were used by the authors in the titles or abstracts of articles categorized as KT. Across all 581 KT articles, eight terms or term variations used by the authors were highly discriminatory for the separation of KT and non-KT articles (p<0.001): implementation, adoption, quality improvement, dissemination, complex intervention (with multiple endings) , implementation ( within three words) research and complex intervention. More KT terms were associated with KT application articles (n=13) and KT theory articles (n=18). Conclusions We have collected 100 terms that describe KT research. Authors used 46 of these in titles and abstracts of KT articles. Of these, about half differentiated between KT and non-KT articles. Therefore, the need for consolidation and consistent use of fewer terms related to KT research is evident.",0,0,
47,formative study of colorectal cancer surveillance: implications for survival-centered interventions,"Colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the United States, and increasing numbers of survivors have emphasized the need for improved quality of colon cancer surveillance. Post-treatment monitoring includes follow-up visits and testing, as well as psychosocial support and lifestyle counseling. This formative study examined the factors at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels associated with adherence to surveillance guidelines to identify modifiable factors for potential educational intervention strategies. A sample of 22 survivors (12 females and 10 males) from two cancer centers were recruited to participate in focus groups or telephone interviews with key informants to explore their experiences of post-treatment care and to complete a short survey. Content analysis was used to identify topics. The results confirmed that the survivors went through a complex surveillance plan and described a strong trust in their healthcare providers that guided their follow-up experiences. The terms “survivorship” and “follow-up” were defined in different ways by the participants. On an individual level, issues critical to the survivor's experience included having a positive attitude, relying on one's beliefs, and managing fear. Interpersonal-level issues focused on interactions and communication with family and healthcare providers in aftercare. While organizational-level factors were rarely highlighted, participants rated office reminder systems and communication between their various providers as valuable. Educational interventions that leverage survivors' connections to their physicians and focus on preparing survivors for what to expect in the next phase of their cancer experience could be beneficial at the end of treatment to prepare survivors for the post-mortem transition to activate the treatment.",0,0,
48,framework for good practice in inter-agency interventions in cases of self-neglect,"Self-neglect is probably more common than commonly thought and creates a number of difficult conceptual, identification and intervention problems for health and social care workers. These patient management problems are compounded by the lack of any real-world evidence base for nurses to rely on when faced with the management of people who are self-neglecting. Nurses who work with self-neglect work in an interdisciplinary context that includes professional groups such as environmental health officers not typically found in health and social care teams. In the absence of such an evidence base, a pragmatic solution in the form of a framework for multi-agency practice has been proposed. The background to this framework, including a research study of housing in self-neglect and multi-agency responses, is briefly outlined in this paper.",0,0,
49,framework to support healthcare professionals in recommending quality apps to support self-management of chronic diseases: Illustrative evaluation of type 2 diabetes apps,"BACKGROUND: This paper presents an approach to assist healthcare professionals in recommending quality apps to support chronic disease self-management. Most app reviews focus on popularity, aesthetics, functionality, usability, and information quality. There is no doubt that these factors are important to select trustworthy apps that are attractive to users, but behavioral theory can also be useful in tailoring the apps to users' needs. OBJECTIVE: The developed framework aims to be methodologically sound, to be able to select popular apps containing content covered by evidence-based programs, consistent with behavioral theory, as well as a patient-centric approach to app customization to the individual needs of the patients. METHODS: A single disease - type 2 diabetes - was chosen to illustrate how the framework could be applied as it was believed to represent the types of strategies used in many chronic diseases. A systematic approach, based on behavioral theory and recommendations from best practice guidelines, was developed to adapt apps to patients' needs. In March 2014, a range of search strategies were used to identify the top-rated iPhone and Android health apps, representing 29 topics across five categories of type 2 diabetes self-management strategies. Topics were selected from published international guidelines for the management of diabetes. The senior author (KH) evaluated the most popular apps found that addressed these topics using the Behavioral Theory Content Survey (BTS), which is based on traditional behavioral theory. A tool to support decision-making when using apps has been developed and tested with healthcare professionals to make it easier to use and understand. RESULTS: A total of 14 apps representing all five self-management topics were evaluated. Total theoretical (BTS) scores were below 50 on a 100-point scale for all apps. Each app scored less than 50% of the total possible BTS score for all four behavioral theories and most of the 20 behavioral strategies"";"" However, apps scored more than 50% of the total possible BTS score for specific strategies related to their main focus. Our results suggest that the apps studied would be more effective in conjunction with therapy than as standalone apps. Apps were categorized by topic and key intervention strategies. Based on app categorization and the principles of patient-centric care, a framework was developed to match apps with identified patient needs. The approach was well accepted and understood by a sample of health practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: The presented framework can be used by healthcare practitioners to better tailor apps to clients' needs. Some apps incorporate highly interactive behavioral theory strategies and, when used as an adjunct, can increase patient involvement and the effectiveness of therapy.",0,0,

The reliability and construct validity of the ECO was examined in 29 inpatients and outpatients with acquired brain damage. The tools were administered by 12 doctors at eight rehabilitation centers and the local Brain Injury Association. RESULTS: The ECO provided descriptive behavioral profiles similar to the original scale. It showed excellent reliability and good convergent and divergent validity, reflected in significant associations with other measures that contained similar behavioral elements and by the lack of correlations of meaning with broader constructs such as physical and cognitive abilities. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the ECO behaves similarly to the original OBS, shows promising initial results in terms of reliability and validity, and represents a valuable research and clinical tool to assess the severity and typology of challenging behaviors after a To assess acquired brain injury and monitor behavioral development after interventions in French and bilingual communities.",0,0,
51,portable computer smoking intervention tool and its implications for physician smoking cessation counseling,"AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate a portable computer-based smoking cessation intervention tool designed to assist physicians in smoking cessation counseling with patients. METHODS: This study used a pre/post survey design with a 4-month trial period for the software. Study participants included 22 faculty and resident physicians from the University of Virginia. Paired-sample t-tests were used to assess mean differences on the 4 major subscales (Physician Behaviour, Attitudes, Comfort with Counseling Patients to Quit Smoking, and Knowledge). RESULTS: No statistically significant mean differences were found for physician behavior (mean increase = 0.44, p = 0.55) or physician attitude (mean increase = 0.44, p = 0.16). A statistically significant mean increase of 2.29 was observed for the physician comfort subscale (t=3.87, df=16, p=0.001). Physicians reported improved comfort in advising patients on smoking cessation (p=0.007) and improved comfort in using public health clinical practice guidelines (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: Physicians' convenience in advising patients on smoking cessation can be enhanced by handheld computer software. When used in conjunction with other practice modifications, this tool has the potential to improve physicians' smoking cessation intervention practices.",0,1,
52,"randomized hybrid efficacy-implementation cluster study of group CBT for anxiety in urban schools: rationale, design, and methods","Background Schools offer a context with great potential for the implementation of psychosocial evidence-based practices. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based practice that has been shown to be very effective in treating anxiety in a variety of settings, including schools. Friends for Life (FRIENDS) is a powerful CBT group protocol for anxiety. Unfortunately, evidence-based practices for anxiety are rarely employed in underfunded urban schools because many treatment protocols do not fit well with the urban school context or population, existing behavioral health staff do not receive adequate training or support to enable them to faithfully implement treatment, or school districts do not have the Resources to contract with external consultants. In our previous work, we adapted FRIENDS to create a more culturally sensitive, focused, and actionable CBT for Anxiety Treatment in Schools (CATS) protocol. Methods/Design The aim of this 5-year study is to evaluate both the effectiveness of CATS for urban public schools compared to the original FRIENDS and the implementation strategies (Train-the-Trainer vs. Train-the-Trainer?+ ) to be compared (ongoing consultation) by conducting a three-arm, parallel group, Type 2 Hybrid Effectiveness Implementation Study in 18 urban K-8 public schools. We will also evaluate the economics and the intermediaries and facilitators of fidelity. 90 therapists, 18 supervisors and 360 children will participate. The Framework for Interactive Systems for Dissemination and Implementation guides the training and support processes for therapists and supervisors. Discussion This study has the potential to show that agency therapists and supervisors who have had little to no experience with evidence-based practices (EBPs) can reliably implement EBPs with an anxiety disorder. Comparisons of implementation strategies would provide data for large urban mental health systems to make decisions about the implementation of EBPs.",0,0,
53,"low-fat vegan diet results in larger macronutrient changes, but is comparable to a more conventional diabetic diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes in terms of compliance and acceptability","BACKGROUND: Although therapeutic diets are critical to diabetes management, their acceptance by patients remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To quantify adherence and acceptability for two types of diets for diabetes. DESIGN: Controlled study conducted between 2004 and 2006. SUBJECTS/SETTINGS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n=99) in a community-based research facility. Participants were randomly assigned to a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat vegan diet for 74 weeks. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Attrition, adherence, eating behaviors, diet acceptance, and cravings. STATISTICAL ANALYZES: In nutrient intake and questionnaire results, t-tests determined differences between groups. For measures of diet acceptance, the Wilcoxon sum-rank test for related samples assessed changes within the group; the Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples compared the diet groups. Changes in reported symptoms between groups were compared to Chi(2) for independent samples. RESULTS: All participants completed the first 22 weeks, 90% (45/50) in the American Diabetes Association diet group (45/50) and 86% (42 /49) of participants in the vegan diet group completed 74 weeks Carbohydrate and fiber intake increased more in the vegan group. At 22 weeks, 44% (22/50) of members in the American Diabetes Association diet group and 67% (33/49 ) the vegan the group-specific dietary compliance criteria-group participants (p=0.019); the American Diabetes Association nutrition group reported a greater increase in dietary restraint;"" this difference was not significant at week 74.

54,meta-analysis of the association between adherence to drug therapy and mortality,"OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between adherence to medical therapy, including placebo, and mortality. DESIGN Meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases, contact with investigators and textbooks and overviews on adherence. Screening Methods Predefined criteria were used to select studies reporting mortality in participants with good and poor adherence. Data were extracted for disease, drug therapy groups, methods of measuring adherence rate, definition of good adherence, and mortality. RESULTS Data were available from 21 studies (46,847 participants), including eight studies with placebo arms (19,633 participants). Compared with poor adherence, good adherence was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.63). Good adherence to placebo was associated with lower mortality (0.56, 0.43 to 0.74), as was good adherence to beneficial drug therapy (0.55, 0.49 to 0.62). Good adherence to harmful drugs was associated with increased mortality (2.90, 1.04 to 8.11). CONCLUSION Good adherence to drug therapy is associated with positive health outcomes. Furthermore, the observed association between good adherence to placebo and mortality supports the existence of the ""healthy adherence"" effect, whereby adherence to drug therapy may be a surrogate marker for overall healthy behavior.",0,0,
55,midwife-led in-hospital birth center within an academic medical center: achievements and challenges,"The University of California San Diego's Community Women's Health Program (CWHP) has emerged as a successful and sustainable coexistence model for women's health care. The cornerstone of this midwifery practice is California's only hospital birthing center. This unique and separate birthing center is located within the medical center and has been the site of more than 4000 births. With 10% cesarean and 98% breastfeeding rates, it is an exceptional example of minimally invasive care. The integration of this formerly detached birth center into an academic center has led to attempts at mistrust and ineffective communication. Education, consistent leadership, and the development of multidisciplinary policies helped address these challenges. This collaborative model provides a structure in which residents learn to be respectful advisors and to appreciate differences in medical practice. The CWHP and its Birth Center demonstrate that through persistence and flexibility, a collaborative model of maternity services can thrive and positively impact not only new families but future generations of providers.",0,0,
56,"migraine management training program for primary care physicians: an overview of the results of a survey and pilot study, lessons learned, and considerations for further research","BACKGROUND: There are five to nine million primary care physician visits for migraines each year in the United States. However, migraine care in primary care is often suboptimal. A previous study showed that primary care physicians (PCPs) desire direct contact with headache specialists to improve the migraine care they provide. OBJECTIVE: We sought to further investigate GP knowledge of migraine management and assess the feasibility of a multimodal migraine education program for GPs. METHODS: We conducted a survey to assess primary care physicians' knowledge of migraine. We then held three live training sessions and developed an email consultation service for GPs to ask questions they had about migraines. We report both quantitative and qualitative results. RESULTS: Twenty-one general practitioners completed the survey. They were generally consistent with the epidemiology of migraine (mean prevalence of reported migraine 12.6% +/- 10.1) and psychiatric comorbidities (mean prevalence of comorbid depression 24.5% +/- 16.7, mean prevalence of comorbid anxiety 24.6% +) familiar /- 18.3) and evidence-based behavioral therapies. 56% named cognitive behavioral therapy, 78% biofeedback and 61% relaxation therapy as evidence-based treatments. Although most were aware of the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, they did not routinely assess for them (43% did not routinely assess for anxiety, 29% did not routinely assess for depression). GPs reported that they frequently refer patients for non-evidence-based, Level A treatments: special diets (60%), acupuncture (50%), physical therapy (30%), and psychoanalysis (20%). Relaxation therapy was recommended by 40% of general practitioners. Only 10% reported turning to cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback. Nineteen percent made minimal or no use of preventive migraine medications. 72% had little or no knowledge of the American Academy of Neurology's migraine guidelines. Attendance at the training sessions varied (N=22 at 1st session, 6 at 2nd session, 15 at 3rd session). Very few PCPs used the email counseling service (N=4). CONCLUSIONS: Although primary care physicians are familiar with many aspects of migraine care, there is a need and opportunity for improvement. The three live sessions were poorly attended and the email counseling service was rarely used. We provide an in-depth discussion of targeted areas for educational interventions, challenges in developing a migraine education program for PCPs, and areas for future study.",0,0,
57,model for collaboration in quality improvement projects: implementation of a weight-based heparin dosing nomogram in an integrated health care system,"BACKGROUND: Aurora Health Care, an integrated delivery system based in Milwaukee, established a system-level clinical quality improvement division in 1995 to facilitate collaboration on clinical quality improvement (QI) initiatives. THE COLLABORATION MODEL: A model was developed to leverage expertise within the system and avoid unnecessary duplication while maintaining acceptance of the project's interventions at the point of service delivery. It was believed that a single team could design the improvement effort or policy and then work at a more local level with another group of people to implement the processes. APPLICATION OF THE MODEL TO THE HEPARIN-QI PROJECT: Anticoagulation with heparin is recognized as a mainstay in the treatment of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. However, a large gap was identified between current anticoagulation practices and published best practices in achieving a key process action. To reduce the overall time to achieve effective anticoagulation, a system-level team created an intervention consisting primarily of a preprinted order sheet, including the nomogram of weight-based heparin dosing, and an educational curriculum for physicians and other health professionals. Significant improvement was observed at all pilot sites, with the overall rate of adequate anticoagulation improving from 73% to 95% within the first 24 hours. DISCUSSION: The system was able to standardize care in four of its five major hospitals and provide better patient outcomes to a larger portion of the population, and then replicate the heparin project at four additional sites over a six-month period. This model has been successfully applied to other quality improvement projects.",0,0,
58,policy analysis modeling tool to support the design of efficient and effective policy responses to complex public health problems,"Background In public health policy-making, a broader understanding of risk factors for disease throughout the life-course and an increasing awareness of the social determinants of health have led to the development of broader, intersectoral strategies to tackle complex problems. However, comprehensive strategies may not represent the most efficient or effective approach to reducing the burden of disease at the population level. Rather, they can act to spread limited resources less intensively across a larger number of programs and initiatives, thereby diluting the potential impact of the investment. Although analytical tools are available that use research to identify and prioritize disease risk factors for public health interventions, they are insufficient to support more targeted and effective policy responses to complex public health problems. Discussion This paper discusses the limitations of analytical tools commonly used to support evidence-based policy decisions on complex problems. It proposes an alternative policy analysis tool that can integrate different sources of evidence and provide a platform for virtually testing policy alternatives to design solutions that are efficient, effective and equitable. The case of suicide prevention in Australia is presented to demonstrate the limitations of current prevention policy information tools and to discuss the usefulness of the new policy analysis tool. Summary Contrary to popular belief, a systems approach goes a step further than broad thinking and seeks to identify where public health interventions and resources can best be deployed to achieve optimal impact. It is primarily concerned with what can reasonably be left out of prevention strategies and can be used to study where disinvestment can occur without compromising the health (or equity) of populations. Simulation models used for policy analysis promise to better operationalize research results to support decision-making on complex problems, improve public health policy direction, and provide a basis for strengthening relationships between policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers .",0,0,
59,national cross-sectional study of socio-behavioural factors influencing physicians' decision to start antimicrobial therapy,"PURPOSE: Current efforts to prevent antimicrobial resistance include limiting antimicrobial use, providing education on appropriate use, and developing better point-of-care testing, but what do physicians actually think of rational prescribing and possible interventions? We sought to understand what factors may influence a physician's decision to start antimicrobial therapy in a patient and his or her opinion on measures to promote rational prescribing. Methods: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 10,600 physicians from the medical associations of all known statutory health insurance physicians in Germany. RESULTS: Of respondents (n=3,492; 33%; including detailed nonresponse bias analysis), 90% said they elect to start antimicrobial therapy in a patient at least weekly, and 66% said they that they would decide every day. We identified correlates to the decision to start antimicrobial therapy in a patient. Predictors were status as hospital physician (odds ratio (OR) 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.68)), physician (OR 1.81 (95% CI 1.42-2.31) ), age 50-59 (OR 1.56 (95% CI 1.10-2.21)) and practiced in the new federal states (OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.15-2.21 )). Each specialist decided to start antimicrobial therapy significantly less frequently than ENT specialists and urologists. Other predictors agreed to prescribing to be on the safe side (OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.03-1.76)) as they believed that the quality of prescribing practice is improving after being continuously used by pharmaceutical companies trained (OR 1.43 (95% CI 1.11-1.84). )) and experience with unsuccessful therapy for resistant pathogens (OR 2.42 (95% CI 1.83-3.19)). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in our sample choose to initiate antimicrobial therapy in a patient and value interventions to support prudent use, e.g. B. Continuing Education, Practice Guidelines and Implementation of Monitoring Measures. Social behavior factors, regional differences, gender and age merit further research to promote rational antimicrobial prescribing and to examine related influencers.",0,0,
60,new tool to assess the risk of walking in hospitalized patients,"This article describes the development and implementation of a migratory screening and intervention program based on the identification of hospitalized patients with cognitive and mobility impairments. A migratory screening tool developed by a multidisciplinary team was linked to appropriate levels of intervention available in the electronic health record. Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs) confirmed the accuracy of screening and bedside nurse interventions for all patients who screened positive. Of 1,528 patients hospitalized during a 3-week period, 48 (3.1%) screened positive for wandering. Patients at risk were elderly (age >/= 65) (66.7%), patients admitted to surgical departments (41.7%), Caucasian (89.6%), and male (58.3%). Thirteen (27.1%) had dementia and 45 (93.8%) had impaired cognition. Of the patients who screened positive for hiking, the APNs agreed with the nurses' assessment in 79.2% of the cases (38/48) regarding risk for hiking and 89.5% (34/38 true positives) of the interventions match. A migratory screening tool and two-element intervention were feasible for use by nurses at the bedside. Further studies are needed to determine if this tool is effective in preventing wandering.",0,0,
61,"Pan-Canadian Practice Guideline: Prevention, Screening, Evaluation, and Management of Sleep Disorders in Adults With Cancer","PURPOSE: This study aims to provide recommendations on the optimal strategies and interventions for the prevention, screening, assessment, and management of cancer-related sleep disorders (insomnia and insomnia syndrome) in adult cancer populations. METHODS: A systematic search of the published health literature was performed to identify randomized controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines, systematic reviews, and other guides. The Sleep Disorders Expert Panel [consisting of nurses, psychologists, primary care physicians, oncologists, sleep disorder physicians, researchers, and guideline methodologists] reviewed, discussed, and approved the final version of the guideline. Healthcare professionals across Canada were asked to provide feedback as part of an external review process. RESULTS: Three clinical practice guidelines and 12 randomized controlled trials were identified as the evidence base. Overall, despite the lack of evidence, the evidence and expert consensus suggest that it is important to routinely screen and assess adult cancer patients for sleep disorders using standardized screening tools. While prevention of sleep disorders is the intended goal, cognitive behavioral therapies are effective in improving sleep outcomes. In the external review of 16 healthcare providers, 81% agreed with the written recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disorders are a widespread problem in cancer populations that need more recognition from healthcare professionals. Prevention, screening, assessment and treatment strategies, based on the best available evidence, are crucial. Recommendations and care path algorithms for practice are offered.",0,0,
62,patient-initiated system for health care.,"Objective To test the effectiveness of a patient-initiated touch-sensitive computer system (TSCS) in improving screening rates for cancers of the breast, cervix, colon and rectum, and oral cavity. Design One-year, randomized, controlled study with primary care practice as the unit of analysis. Set up sixty primary care practices randomly recruited from 329 non-teaching practices in a southeastern state. Subjects Random sample of medical records of 50 pre-intervention male and female adult patients and 50 post-intervention adult patients at each office and a random sample of 507 TSCS users. Interventions Touch-sensitive computer system and a registered nurse who served as the liaison to the study offices. The TSCS provided patient-specific recommendations for preventive services and facilitated workflow to expedite delivery of these interventions. Main Outcome Measures Mean change, adjusted for Health Maintenance Examination (HME) and use of TSCS, in the proportion of eligible patients undergoing screening mammography, clinical breast exam, digital rectal exam, fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, papanicolaou - Swab and examination of the oral cavity. Results We observed a significant increase in the performance of screening mammograms (6.6%; P<=0.05) and clinical breast examinations (6.1%; P<=0.01) in women aged 50 and over older, particularly among those who had an HME during the academic year. Conclusions Patients with HME are more likely to receive cancer screening, however, a computerized system for preventive services can help improve screening. Among patients who did not have HME, TSCS users had a higher rate of breast cancer screening than non-users.",0,1,
63,peer-reviewed feedback method to promote adherence to prevention guidelines in an ambulatory care clinic,"BACKGROUND: Simply distributing clinical practice guidelines to physicians does not change practice behavior. At the Marshall University School of Medicine outpatient clinic (Huntington, West Virginia), a low-cost, continuous peer-reviewed feedback method was used to promote adherence by resident physicians to nine preventive care guidelines. METHODS: Prevention guidelines were distributed and a peer-reviewed feedback program was implemented in the general practice of the general practitioner. The frequency of use of nine preventive care options in private practices was collected and compared over three periods: pre-guideline (September 1, 1993 to March 1, 1994; 148 patients), guideline (September 1, 1994 to March 1, 1995; 148 patients) and one-year Follow-up (September 1, 1995 to March 1, 1996; 150 patients).Patients in the three periods were similar in terms of age, sex, and risk of influenza and pneumococcal infections.RESULTS:During the guideline period, resident physicians offered patients four prophylactic Treatments for - tetanus toxoid immunization, clinical breast examination, papanicolaou smear test, and hemoccult test - were offered significantly more frequently than during the pre-guideline period All services were offered significantly more frequently than in the pre-guideline and as frequently as in the guideline in the one-year follow-up period : An affordable, continuous peer-reviewed feedback pro gramm significantly and permanently improves the compliance of resident physicians with the guidelines of clinical practice on preventive care services. However, the effectiveness of the feedback method for poor reviews may not generalize to private practices or other settings. Research into other methods of promoting adherence to clinical practice guidelines and influencing physician behavior in general should continue.",0,1,
64,pilot study of an electronic interprofessional evidence-based care planning tool for clients with mental health problems and addictions,"BACKGROUND: The health system needs to develop effective solutions to the growing challenges it faces in relation to people with mental health disorders and addictions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability and potential impact on outcomes of a knowledge translation system aimed at improving client-centered, evidence-based care for hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. METHODOLOGY: A pre-posttest design was used. The e-Volution TREAT system was implemented in two inpatient units of a large psychiatric facility. 37 nurses, allied health workers and doctors from two units attended. Data collection included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and observations. Outcome data from 38 consenting clients was collected from the organization's records. RESULTS: Overall, the participating employees were very satisfied with the functions of the e-Volution TREAT system. Barriers to using the system were identified by participants in relation to the work environment, staff shortages, equipment issues, uneasiness with using technology, and a focus on short-term rather than long-term goals. Guidelines on social issues were used moderately, and guidelines on family support and addictions were poorly used. There were significant improvements over time in four client outcomes, specifically aggressive behavior, depression, withdrawal, and psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, users were overall satisfied with the e-Volution TREAT system, but expressed workload challenges that impacted the time to use the system. Without a randomized controlled trial with outcomes compared to a control group, it would be premature to conclude that the change in patient outcomes is related to the e-Volition TREAT system. Future research must incorporate strategies for changing context and involve clinicians capable of modeling change.",0,1,
65,population-based cross-sectional study of colorectal cancer screening practices of first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the proportions and predictors of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (i) ever receiving a CRC test and (ii) CRC screening according to the Get CRC Screening Guidelines. METHODS: Colorectal cancer patients and their FDRs were recruited via the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry, Victoria, Australia. Seven hundred and seven FDRs conducted telephone interviews. Of these, 405 FDRs were classified as asymptomatic and suitable for analysis. RESULTS: 69% of FDRs had ever received a CRC test. Older first-degree relatives, those with private health insurance, siblings, and FDRs who had ever been interviewed by a physician about their family history of CRC were significantly more likely than their peers to have ever received a CRC test. Twenty-five percent of FDRs “at risk or slightly above average” adhered to the CRC screening guidelines. For this group, adherence to the guideline-recommended screening was significantly more likely in male FDRs and those with a higher level of education. For those at “moderate risk” and “potentially high risk,” 47% and 49%, respectively, adhered to the CRC screening guidelines. For this group, the guidelines-recommended screening was significantly more likely for FDRs who lived in metropolitan areas, siblings, married or partner, and those who were ever asked about a family history of CRC. CONCLUSIONS: FDRs demonstrated a significant level of non-compliance with screening guidelines. Improved CRC screening according to guidelines and effective systematic interventions to increase screening rates in populations affected by inequality are needed.

66,primary care nurse-delivered rescue intervention in older adults: PACE (Pedometer Accelerometer Consultation Evaluation)-Lift-Cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Brisk walking in the elderly may increase step count and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) in >/= 10-minute bouts, as recommended by World Health Organization guidelines. Previous interventions have reported an increase in step count but no change in objectively measured MVPA in older people. We examined whether a complex intervention performed by a primary care nurse increased objectively measured step counts and MVPA. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 988 60- to 75-year-olds able to increase walking randomly selected from three UK GP practices were invited to participate in a parallel, two-armed, randomized cluster study; randomization was by household. Two hundred - 98 people from 250 households were randomized between 2011 and 2012;"" 150 people in the intervention group, 148 in the control group for usual care. Intervention participants received four physical activity (PA) consultations over a 3-month period from caregivers in of primary care, which included behavior modification techniques, pedometer pedometer and accelerometer PA intensity feedback, and an individual PA diary and plan. Assessors were not blinded to group status, but statistical analyzes were performed blindly. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to month 3 in average daily step count measured by accelerometry, with the change at month 12 being a secondary endpoint.Other secondary endpoints were the change in MVPA over time from baseline in >/= 10-minute seizures, Akzel erometer counts and counts/minute at 3 months and 12 months. Other outcomes included adverse events, anthropometric measurements, mood, and pain. Qualitative evaluations by intervention participants and practice nurses assessed acceptance of the intervention. At 3 months, eight participants had withdrawn or were lost for follow-up, 280 (94%) subjects provided primary outcome data. At 3 months, changes in both mean daily step count and weekly MVPA in >/= 10-minute bouts were significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group: by 1,037 (95% CI 513-1,560) steps/day and 63 ( 95% CI 40-87) minutes/week. At 12 months, the corresponding differences were 609 (95% CI 104-1115) steps/day and 40 (95% CI 17-63) minutes/week. Counts and counts/minute showed similar effects as steps and MVPA. Adverse events, anthropometry, mood, and pain were similar in both groups. Participants and practice nurses found the intervention acceptable and comfortable. CONCLUSIONS: The PACE-Lift study increased both step count and objectively measured MVPA in >/= 10-minute seizures in 60-75 year olds aged 3 and 12 months, with no impact on adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first study in this age group to show objective increases in MVPA and underscores the value of individualized support incorporating objective PA assessment in a primary care setting.

67,process to develop a community consensus related to the diagnosis and treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Major discrepancies remain between pediatrician practice patterns and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several studies raise additional concerns about access to ADHD treatment for girls, blacks, and poorer individuals. Barriers can occur at multiple levels, including identification and referral by school staff, parental help-seeking behavior, diagnosis by the healthcare provider, treatment decisions, and treatment acceptance. These results confirm the importance of establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure that children of both genders and all socioeconomic, racial and ethnic groups receive appropriate evaluation and treatment. The release of the AAP ADHD Toolkit provides resources to assist in implementing ADHD guidelines into clinical practice. These resources address a number of barriers to implementation in practice, including ignorance of the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, difficulties in identifying comorbidities, and insufficient knowledge of effective coding practices. Also critical to the success of improved processes in clinical practice is community collaboration in care, particularly collaboration with the educational system. Such collaboration removes other barriers to good care, such as B. pressure from parents and schools to prescribe stimulants, cultural biases that may prevent schools from screening children for ADHD or families from seeking medical care, and discrepancies in recognition and referral between schools in the same system. Collaboration can also create efficiencies in data collection and school-physician communication, thereby reducing physicians' non-personal (and thus non-reimbursable) elements of care. This article describes a process used in Guilford County, North Carolina to reach consensus among health care providers, educators, and child advocates regarding the assessment and treatment of children with ADHD symptoms. The result, a community protocol followed by school staff and community physicians for >10 years, ensures communication and collaboration between educators and physicians in the assessment and management of children with ADHD symptoms. This protocol has the potential to increase practice efficiencies, improve practice standards for children with ADHD, and improve child identification in schools. Perhaps most importantly, the community process through which the protocol was developed and implemented has an educational component that increases school staff's knowledge of ADHD and its treatment, increases the likelihood that referrals will be appropriate, and increases the likelihood that Children from the coordination benefit from interventions between school staff, doctors and parents. The protocol reflects a consensus among school staff and community health providers regarding: (1) ""ideal ADHD assessment and treatment principles""; (2) a common entry point (one team) at schools for children assessed for inattention and classrooms behavioral issues, whether the issues first arise with a medical provider, the behavioral health system, or the school; (3) a protocol followed by the school system that recognizes schools' resource limitations but meets the needs of community health providers for instructional observations , psychoeducational testing, parental and teacher behavioral rating scales, and functional assessment; (4) an information pack on each child identified as requiring a medical evaluation; (5) a liaison or team at each doctor's office to to receive the package men from the school and referral to the appropriate clinician; (6) an assessment process that examines comorbidities and applies appropriate diagnostic criteria; (7) evidence-based interventions; (8) procedures for follow-up monitoring of children after a treatment plan has been established; (9) roles for key participants (school staff, physicians, school nurses, and mental health professionals) in the assessment, management, and follow-up of children with attention deficit disorders; (10) Forms for collecting and sharing information at each step; (11) Processes and key contacts for communication flow at each step; and (12) a plan to educate school and health professionals about the new processes. A recreation of the community process initiated in Forsyth County, North Carolina in 2001 provides insight into the role of the AAP ADHD guidelines in facilitating the development of a community consensus protocol. This replication also draws attention to school-level identification and referral barriers. The following recommendations, drawn from the 2 community processes, describe a role for physicians in the collaborative community care of children with ADHD symptoms. (1) Reach consensus with the school system regarding the role of school staff in collecting data for children with learning and behavioral difficulties; Components to consider include (a) vision and hearing screening, (b) educational/school history, (c) classroom observation by a counselor, (d) rating scales for parental and teacher behavior (e.g., Vanderbilt, Conner, or Achenbach scales), (e) accounting for speech/language assessment, (f) screening intelligence tests, (g) screening achievement tests, (h) full intelligence and achievement tests when discrepancies are evident in abbreviated tests, and (i) Attempt classroom interventions (2) Visit the pediatrician's office to identify children with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention (medical history or questionnaire) (3) Refer identified children to the contact person at each child's school and request information in accordance with Community consensus (4) Designate a contact person who will receive school practice materials. (5) Review the school's package and integrate the school's data into the clinical assessment. (6) Affirm with parents and the school the need for a multimodal intervention, including academic and learning strategies for the classroom and home, in-depth psychological testing of children whose cognitive level/performance discrepancies suggest learning or language disabilities, and the Need for an individualized education plan (special education), consideration of the designation “other impaired” as an alternative route to an individualized education plan or 504 plan (classroom accommodations), behavior modification techniques for targeted behavior problems, and drug testing as indicated.

68,"prospective, multicenter study of a pneumonia practice guideline","AIM: To investigate the impact of a practice guideline on length of stay on patient outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective, non-randomized, interventional study. SETTING: Six geographically dispersed hospitals. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty-two consecutively hospitalized ""low-risk"" patients with pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients (63%) completed the mailed post-discharge survey and were included in the analysis. The data were collected prospectively for 85 patients from the baseline observation period (B) and 67 patients from the intervention period (I). During I, case managers provided physicians with patient risk information based on guideline recommendations. There was no significant change in guideline compliance (B vs. I: 76.5% vs. 83.6%; p=0.32) or length of stay (B vs. I: 3.5 days [95% CI, 3, 2 to 3.8] vs. 3.6 days [95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 4.0]). Additionally, there were no statistically significant effects of the intervention on patient outcomes, post-hospital care, and patient satisfaction scores. CONCLUSION: Patients in this study often had a shorter length of stay than recommended by the practice guideline. This suggests that the external environment may have had a greater impact on physician behavior and length of stay than the practice guideline itself. In addition, it demonstrates the importance of ongoing assessment of physician practices immediately before, during, and after the application of the clinical practice guideline.",0,0,
69,protocol for the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder. A field test of a potential prototype,"BACKGROUND: Much attention is given to the development of clinical practice guidelines for the management of mental health disorders. The aim of this study was to field test a prototype protocol for the pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder. METHOD: The protocol consisted of four, six-week treatment phases with critical therapy decisions defined by scores on the MADRS (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Observational data collected on the protocol's behavior in terms of relevance, acceptance, ease of use and effectiveness. RESULTS: The effectiveness of the protocol was good for the patients who adhered to it, with three quarters of them achieving remission. However, more than half of all patients discontinued treatment, with no-shows and adverse events being the most common reasons. CONCLUSION: The protocol for the treatment of major depressive disorder appeared relevant, easy to use and potentially effective. LIMITATION: Physician and patient non-compliance issues presented significant challenges to the design of the protocol. Such difficulties demonstrate the need to field test any proposed design, since prejudices about a protocol's performance can be misplaced. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The tested protocol represents an advance towards the goal of developing optimal strategies for the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents in the treatment of depression.",0,0,
70,qualitative assessment of the barriers and intermediaries in implementing the WHO surgical safety checklist in hospitals in England: lessons learned from the surgical checklist implementation project,"Objectives: To assess how the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist has been implemented in hospitals in England; identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation;' and generally draw lessons for the implementation of surgical/healthcare improvement initiatives. Background: The WHO checklist has been associated with improved surgical outcomes and teamwork, but we know little about the factors that influence their successful implementation Methods: A longitudinal interview study of OR staff in a representative sample of 10 hospitals in England was conducted between March 2010 and March 2011. The interviews were recorded over the telephone and respondents were ranked according to their experience with the introduction of the checklist and the factors that hindered or supported this process.The transcripts were subjected to a thematic analysis.Results: A total of 119 interviews were conducted.The implementation of the checklist varied greatly between and within hospitals and ranged from pre-planned/step-by-step approaches to checklists that simply “appeared” in operating rooms or staff felt forced to do. Most implementation barriers were specific to the checklist itself (e.g. perceived design issues) but also involved problematic integration into pre-existing processes. The most common barrier was resistance from experienced clinicians. The facilitators highlighted some positive steps that can be taken to prevent/address these barriers, e.g. B. modifying the checklist, providing education/training, providing feedback on local data, fostering strong leadership (particularly at participant level) and introducing accountability. Conclusions: We identified common themes that supported or hindered the adoption of the WHO checklist in England and translated these into recommendations to guide the implementation of improvement initiatives in surgery and the wider health system.",0,1,
71,qualitative study to understand the non-guideline use of imaging for staging of prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: About half of veterans with low-risk prostate cancer receive non-guideline imaging. Our aim was to identify and describe (1) physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practices related to the use of imaging for staging of prostate cancer, (2) patient attitudes and behaviors regarding the use of imaging and (3) to compare the responses of three VA Medical Centers (VAMCs). METHODS: A qualitative approach was used to examine patient and provider knowledge and behavior regarding the use of imaging. We conducted a total of 39 semi-structured interviews—including 22 interviews with newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and 17 interviews with treating physicians—in three VAMCs between September 2014 and July 2015, representing a spectrum of inappropriate imaging rates. After the core theoretical concepts were identified, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was chosen to explore connections between topics within the data set and existing domains within the framework. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and then encoded and analyzed using Nvivo software. RESULTS: Subjects from patient interviews were categorized into four TDF domains. Patients reported little interest in staging compared to disease treatment (goals), and many could not recall having had imaging at all (knowledge). Patients were more likely to trust their doctor to make decisions about appropriate testing (Beliefs about Capabilities). Some patients expressed minor concerns about exposure to radiation, but fear of the consequences of the cancer outweighed these fears (emotions). Physician interview topics were categorized into five TDF domains. Most physicians reported knowing and trusting imaging guidelines (knowledge), but some likely followed their own intuition, whether based on clinical suspicion or years of experience (belief in ability). In addition, physicians reported that medicolegal concerns, fear of missing associated diagnoses (consequence beliefs), the influence of peers who frequently take pictures (social influences), and the facility in which they practice practice affect imaging rates (environmental context ). CONCLUSIONS: Interviews with patients and physicians suggest that physicians are the primary (and in some cases only) decision makers regarding imaging staging of prostate cancer. This finding suggests that targeted physician intervention may be the most effective strategy for improving guideline-compliant prostate cancer imaging.",0,0,
72,quality improvement intervention to address vendor behavior related to the application of the CA-MRSA guidelines,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a provider-focused quality improvement training intervention on appropriate prescribing for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. BACKGROUND: Patient, provider, and healthcare system factors contribute to appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Achieving adequate prescribing is critical to reducing the burden of antibiotic resistance. Knowing about appropriate prescribing for community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection is the first step in shifting prescriber behavior towards evidence-based recommendations. DESIGN: Quality improvement project. METHOD: After a review of best practice guidelines and the application of the Stetler Research Utilization model, a brief pedagogical intervention using voice-over PowerPoint was conducted. Items of the educational intervention included indications for screening, particularly the role of monitoring and waiting after culturing for simple abscesses. The intervention was delivered in a for-profit, non-academic emergency care setting and assessed the knowledge and practice of the prescribing providers. RESULTS: Of 48 physicians, physician assistants, and nurses, 18 (37.5%) participated"";"" 12 of the 18 (67%) participants showed an increase in knowledge. 43% of the prescribing tables showed improved practice through the use of the guidelines. Of 18 prescribing physicians, 44% sent a total of 21 cultures for abscesses. There was no difference in practical behavior between the occupational groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in knowledge values, this improvement in knowledge did not result in dramatic changes in practice, although trends in a positive direction were noted. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This quality improvement project underscores the complexity of changing prescriber behavior and the need for ongoing interventions.",0,0,
73,quantitative method for evaluating prescription patterns using electronic health records,"BACKGROUND: Most available quality indicators for hospitals are represented by simple ratios or proportions and are limited to specific events. A generalized method that can be applied to different clinical events has not been developed. The aim of this study was to develop a simple method to assess physician prescribing patterns for different events and their awareness of clinical guidelines. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a quantitative method called Prescription Pattern Around Clinical Event (PACE) that is applicable to Electronic Medical Records (EHRs). Three discrete prescription patterns (intervention, maintenance, and discontinuation) were determined based on the prescription change index (PCI), which was calculated from the increase or decrease in prescription rate after a clinical event. Hyperkalemia and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) were used as example cases. We calculated the PCIs of 10 drugs associated with hyperkalemia, categorized them into prescription patterns, and then compared the resulting prescription patterns to known standards for hyperkalemia treatment. The physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia was assessed using a questionnaire and compared with the prescription model. Prescriptions for CDAD were also identified and compared to clinical knowledge. Clinical data from 1698, 348 and 1288 patients were collected from EHR data. The physicians who prescribed behaviors for hyperkalemia and CDAD were standard knowledge. Prescribing patterns correlated well with individual physicians' knowledge of hyperkalemia (kappa = 0.714). Prescribing behavior according to event severity or clinical condition was presented as a simple summary chart. CONCLUSION: The algorithm successfully evaluated the prescribing patterns from the EHR data. Prescribing patterns correlated well with physician knowledge. We anticipate that this algorithm will enable prescribers' adherence to clinical guidelines to be quantified and serve to facilitate improved prescribing practices.",0,0,
74,"randomized clinical trial of a tailored lifestyle intervention for obese, sedentary patients in primary care","PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to test a tailored lifestyle intervention to help obese primary care patients achieve weight loss and increase physical activity. METHODS: We conducted a 24-month randomized clinical trial in Rhode Island. Primary care physicians identified obese, sedentary patients who were motivated to lose weight and increase their moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. These patients were randomized into 1 of 2 experimental groups: enhanced intervention (EI) or standard intervention (SI). Both groups received 3 face-to-face weight loss meetings. The expanded intervention group also received telephone counseling calls, individually tailored printed materials, and DVDs focusing on nutrition and physical activity. Active intervention occurred at year 1 with an ending maintenance phase at year 2. RESULTS: 211 obese, sedentary patients were recruited from 24 primary care practices. The participants were 79% women and 16% minorities. They had an average age of 48.6 years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 37.8 kg/m2 and 21.2 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Significantly more EI participants lost 5% of their baseline weight than SI participants (post-visit group, P<0.001). The difference was significant during active treatment at 6 months (37.2% EI vs. 12.9% SI) and 12 months (47.8% vs. 11.6%), but was greater during the maintenance phase at 18 months ( 31.4% vs. 26.7%) no longer significant. or 24 months (33.3% vs. 24.6%). The EI group reported significantly more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity over time than the SI group (post-visit group, P=0.04). The differences in minutes per week at 6 months were 95.7 minutes for the EI group vs. 68.3 minutes for the SI group; at 12 months, they were 126.1 vs. 73.7; at 18 months, 103.7 vs. 63.7; and at 24 months, 101.3 vs. 75.4. Similar trends were found for absolute weight loss and percentage meeting national physical activity guidelines. CONCLUSION: A home-based tailored lifestyle intervention in obese, sedentary primary care patients was effective in promoting weight loss and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with effects peaking at 12 months but tapering off at 24 months.",0,0,
75,randomized controlled trial of a drug use review intervention for sedating hypnotic medications,"OBJECTIVES: Drug use screening is used by both the public and private sectors to influence patient prescribing behavior and drug use. Previous interventions mailed to prescribers have had mixed results. The aim was to evaluate the effect of a one-time mailed intervention on subsequent use of sedating hypnotic drugs. Methods: An experimental design was used. The intervention included guidelines for the use of sedating hypnotics, a prescriber profile describing the prescribing of sedating hypnotics, and a patient profile. Grouping of patients and their common prescribers was performed to avoid contamination bias and statistical problems related to lack of independence of observations. The subjects were 189 Washington State Medicaid recipients who had received at least one pill of a sedating hypnotic drug per day for 1 year and their prescribing physicians or (when information about the physician was missing) the dispensing pharmacy. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the use of targeted sedative hypnotics was measured in the intervention group (-27.6%) compared to the control group (-8.5%). In the intervention group, 9.4% of patients started a new prescription of a benzodiazepine not targeted by drug use review, while none of the control patients started a new use of non-target benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention produced a statistically significant reduction in targeted drug use, and the magnitude of the reduction may have reduced the risk of fractures associated with benzodiazepine use. This study adds to the recent evidence that post-mail drug use screening interventions can have a desirable impact on patients' drug use.",0,0,
76,randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive lifestyle management intervention (ELMI) after cardiac rehabilitation: study design and baseline data,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) represent comprehensive interventions, typically limited to four months. After completion of CRP, risk factors and lifestyle behaviors appear to worsen. The Extensive Lifestyle Management Intervention (ELMI) Following Cardiac Rehabilitation Study will examine the benefits of a randomized intervention to prevent these adverse changes. METHODS: Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) were randomized to ELMI or usual care after standard CRP. The ELMI program is a case-driven intervention aimed at individualizing risk factor and lifestyle management based on current treatment guidelines. The program consists of cardiac rehabilitation sessions, telephone follow-up, and risk factor and lifestyle counseling sessions. Health professionals work with participants through behavioral counseling and communication with participants' GPs. Participants on usual care return for care from their GP and only come to the study clinic for the annual outcome assessment. The primary outcome is the change in global IHD risk at four years. Secondary endpoints include composite cardiovascular events, health care utilization, lifestyle compliance, quality of life, and risk factors. RESULTS: Over 28 months, 302 men and women were randomized. This represented 29% of the total population screened. The mean age of the study participants is 64 years, 18% are women, 53% had a previous myocardial infarction, 73% had a previous revascularization and 20% have diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for ischemic heart disease for the entire cohort improved significantly after subjects went through previous CRPs. Baseline risk factors, lifestyle behaviors, and medications were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study population is representative of patients completing standard CRP. The results of the ELMI study will provide valuable information for the future design of CRPs.",0,0,
77,randomized controlled trial of IVR-based brief alcohol intervention to promote patient-provider communication in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Brief interventions for unhealthy alcohol use in primary care are effective but underutilized. Efforts to improve short-term intervention rates through provider training and office systems redesign have had limited effect. Our novel brief intervention uses Interactive Voice Response (IVR) to provide direct information and counseling to unhealthy drinkers prior to a doctor's visit, with the goal of stimulating in-office dialogue about drinking and reducing unhealthy drinking. This automated approach is potentially scalable for wide application. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term pre-visit alcohol intervention (IVR-BI) on patient-caregiver conversations about alcohol during the visit. DESIGN: This was a randomized, controlled, parallel-group study with two treatment arms: 1) IVR-BI or 2) usual care (no IVR-BI). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1,567 patients from eight university medical clinics for internal medicine and family medicine were recruited. INTERVENTIONS: IVR-BI is a brief alcohol intervention delivered via automated telephone. It has four components based on the intervention steps outlined in the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism guidelines for clinicians: 1) asking about alcohol use, 2) evaluating for alcohol use disorders, 3) advising the patient to limit alcohol use, or stop doing so, and 4) follow up on subsequent visits. KEY INTERVENTIONS: Outcomes were reported by patient: discussion between patient and provider about alcohol during visit; patient initiation of the conversation;' and the physician's recommendation of the patient's alcohol consumption. MAIN RESULTS: Patients randomized to IVR-BI were more likely to report having discussed alcohol with their doctor (52% vs. 44%, p=0.003) and to have raised the issue themselves (20% vs 12%, p<0.001) and received a referral (20% vs. 14%, p<0.001). Other predictors for the result were consumption, education, age and the diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Providing automated brief interventions to patients prior to a GP visit encourages discussion about unhealthy drinking and increases specific professional counseling to change drinking behavior.",0,0,
78,randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a distance learning program for pediatricians in asthma,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate provider acceptance of a distance learning program for pediatric asthma and pilot test its impact on physician knowledge, attitudes, and treatment practices. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Louisville and the surrounding region in central Kentucky. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four pediatricians in clinical practice. interventions. A distance learning program for pediatric asthma consisting of web or CD-ROM based multimedia learning modules and two conference calls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Learner satisfaction and changes in physicians' asthma knowledge, attitudes, and treatment behavior at 1 to 4 months (short-term) and 6 to 8 months (long-term). RESULTS: Pediatricians had completed their medical studies an average of 11.6 years prior to study entry (SD +/-8.9)"";"" 56% were female. For all aspects of student satisfaction, the average score on a 5-point scale was 4.0 or higher, indicating a positive response from participants. Participants in the training group reported increased familiarity with asthma guidelines for prescribing daily inhaled corticosteroids during short-term follow-up compared to control physicians (p=0.03). Participants also expressed increased confidence in drug selection for patients requiring a low-dose inhaled steroid (p=0.03). However, these differences were not observed in long-term follow-up. Compared to the control group, there was no significant increase in the proportion of patients receiving inhaled steroids for persistent asthma at short- or long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians who participated in an asthma distance learning program reported high levels of learner satisfaction. The program was associated with a transient increase in familiarity and confidence in the implementation of components of the asthma guidelines.",0,0,
79,randomized controlled trial to improve lymph node assessment in stage II colon cancer,"HYPOTHESIS: Physicians seem to learn best from their peers, but the influence of opinion leaders on physician behavior is unclear. Because colon cancer staging was identified as suboptimal in Ontario, Canada, we sought to assess the influence of colorectal cancer experts and local opinion leaders in optimizing colorectal cancer lymph node assessment. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A cluster-randomized study including all Ontario hospitals that included a local opinion leader with an intervention between January 5 and June 17, 2004 identified an expert opinion leader in colorectal cancer. The 21 intervention hospitals also received a scientific description of a local opinion leader by the expert opinion leader and a toolkit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean number of lymph nodes assessed in patients with stage II colon cancer and the proportion of cases assessed with at least 12 lymph nodes before and after a standardized presentation were assessed. RESULTS: Patient demographics and tumor factors were similar in both groups before and after the standardized presentation. Lymph node assessment improved significantly (p<0.001) after standardized presentation at intervention and control sites. No additional benefit of academic detailing and provision of toolkits in the intervention was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Personal provision of information by a colorectal cancer opinion leader may enhance performance in colorectal cancer lymph node assessment. Scientific detailing from a local opinion leader did not further improve lymph node assessment.",0,0,
80,randomized outpatient trial of an information technology decision support tool.,"Background Information technology for decision support is often used to improve clinical decision making, but it is seldom rigorously evaluated. Congress mandated the evaluation of Problem-Knowledge Couplers (PKC Corp, Burlington, Vt.), a decision support tool proposed for the Department of Defense's new health information network. Methods This was a patient-level, randomized study conducted in 2 military practices. A total of 936 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 966 to standard care. Couplers were applied prior to routine outpatient clinic visits. The primary outcome was quality of care, which was assessed based on the overall percentage of 24 health care quality process measures (ability to provide evidence-based care) that were met. Secondary endpoints included medical resource consumption within 60 days of enrollment and patient and provider satisfaction. Results There were 4639 health care choices (2374 in the coupler group and 2265 in the usual care group) with no difference in the proportion of choices fulfilled (33.9% vs. 30.7%; P=0.12). Although there was a modest improvement in performance on screening/prevention interventions, this was offset by poorer performance on some acute care interventions. Coupler patients consumed more laboratory and pharmacy resources than standard care patients (log mean difference, $71). No difference in patient satisfaction was observed between groups, and provider satisfaction was mixed. Conclusion This study does not provide strong evidence for the usefulness of this decision support tool, but it does demonstrate the value of a rigorous evaluation of information technology for decision support.",0,1,
81,"randomized attempt at ""follow-up commands"" to avoid omission errors.","Objective: Omission errors are a common cause of system failures. Doctors often fail to order tests or treatments needed to monitor/improve the effects of other tests or treatments. The authors hypothesized that automated, guideline-based reminders to physicians when writing instructions might reduce these omissions. Design: The study was conducted on the inpatient general medical ward of a public teaching hospital. Faculty and domestic staff at Indiana University School of Medicine who used computer workstations to write instructions were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. When intervention physicians wrote instructions for 1 of 87 selected tests or treatments, the computer suggested appropriate instructions needed to detect or mitigate adverse reactions to the trigger instructions. Doctors could accept or reject these suggestions. RESULTS: During the 6-month study, reminders for subsequent prescriptions were presented to 48 intervention physicians and withheld from 41 control physicians. Intervention physicians ordered the proposed follow-up orders 46.3% of the time when they received a reminder, compared with 21.9% of control physicians (p<0.0001). Physicians discriminated in accepting proposed prescriptions, willingly accepting some while rejecting others. There were a third fewer pharmacist-initiated interventions with physicians in the intervention than control groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that physician workstations, coupled with a comprehensive electronic medical record, can be an effective means of reducing omission errors and improving adherence to practice guidelines.",1,1,
82,randomized trial of a computer-assisted intervention to reduce the use of redundant laboratory tests,"PURPOSE: To determine the impact of computerized reminders to physicians about seemingly redundant clinical laboratory tests. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study including all inpatients at a large teaching hospital over a 15-week period. The intervention consisted of computerized reminders of when a test that seemed redundant was ordered. The main target parameters were the proportion of canceled clinical laboratory orders and the proportion of tests actually performed. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 939 apparently redundant laboratory tests among the 77,609 study tests allocated between the intervention (n=5,700 patients) and control (n=5,886 patients) groups. In the intervention group, 69% (300 out of 437) of the tests were discontinued due to reminders. Out of 137 overrides, 41% appeared justified based on review of the charts. In the control group, 51% of the ordered redundant tests were performed, while only 27% of the ordered redundant tests were performed in the intervention group (p < 0.001). However, the estimated annual savings in lab fees was only $35,000. This happened because only 44% of the redundant tests performed had computer orders, because only half of the computer orders were checked for redundancy, and because nearly a third of the reminders were overridden. CONCLUSIONS: Order reminders for apparently redundant laboratory tests were effective when delivered. However, the overall effect was limited because many tests were run without corresponding computer orders, and many orders were not checked for redundancy.",1,1,
83,randomized trial of computerized reminders and audit and feedback to improve primary care HIV screening.,"Despite recommendations for voluntary HIV screening, few medical centers have implemented screening programs. The aim of the study was to determine whether a computerized reminder and feedback intervention would increase screening for HIV in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. The study design was a randomized controlled trial in five primary care clinics of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. All general practitioners were able to take part in the study. The study intervention consisted of computerized reminders to either assess HIV risk behaviors or to offer HIV testing.” Feedback on reminder compliance was provided. The key outcome measure was the difference in HIV testing rates between the intervention and control group providers. The control group Providers tested 1.0% (n=67) and 1.4% (n=106) of patients in the preintervention and intervention phases, respectively;” Intervention providers tested 1.8% (n=98) and 1, respectively, 9% (n=114) (p=0.75). In our random sample of 753 untested patients, 204 (27%) had documented risky behaviors. Providers adhered to testing reminders rather than reminders to perform a risk assessment (11% vs. 5%, P<0.01). Sixty-one percent of vendors felt that lack of time prevented risk assessment. In summary, HIV testing rates in primary care clinics in our area have been low. Providers were unaware of the high rate of risky behaviors in their patient population and saw important barriers to testing. Clinical reminders and low-intensity feedback did not increase screening rates.",0,1,
84,randomized trial of computerized reminders for blood pressure screening in primary care.,"In a randomized, controlled trial (N = 8,298), the authors compared three ways of getting patients to monitor blood pressure in a large primary care practice. Based on computerized medical records in a family medicine teaching center, the study included patients aged 18 years and older who had not had their blood pressure measured in the previous year. In a normally served control group, 21.1% of those due for a blood pressure measurement received one during the trial year. In one intervention group, a computer-generated message reminded the doctor to check the blood pressure of patients who happened to visit the center for an appointment.” 30.7% of the patients assigned to this group were checked. In the second group, the nurse contacted patients by phone and encouraged 24.1% of patients who were due to get a check. Sending a letter to patients in the third group resulted in a 35.7% compliance rate. Considering the cost of the three interventions, physician reminder was the most costly effective, followed by reminder letters. Although statistically significant, the effect of the reminders was modest. A better approach might be a combination of routine reminders to the physician, followed by letters to noncompliant patients, include.",0,1,
85,randomized trial of electronic clinical reminders to improve the quality of care in diabetes and coronary artery disease.,"Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an integrated patient-specific electronic clinical reminder system on the management of diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) and to assess physician attitudes towards this reminder system. Design: We recruited 194 primary care physicians attending 4549 diabetic patients and 2199 CHD patients in 20 outpatient clinics. Clinics were randomized so that physicians received either evidence-based electronic reminders in their patients' electronic medical records or usual care. There were five reminders for diabetes care and four reminders for CHD care. Measurements: The primary outcome was maintenance of recommended treatment for diabetes and CHD. We created a summary outcome to assess the likelihood of increased compliance with general diabetes care (based on five measures) and general CAD care (based on four measures). We surveyed physicians to assess attitudes toward the memory system. Results: Baseline adherence rates for all quality measures were low. While electronic reminders increased the likelihood of recommended diabetes care (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.67) and CHD (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55 ) increased, the impact of individual reminders was variable. A total of three out of nine reminders effectively increased rates of recommended treatment for diabetes or CAD. The majority of physicians (76%) felt reminders improved the quality of care. Conclusion: An integrated electronic reminder system resulted in a variable improvement in diabetes and CHD care. These improvements have often been limited and gaps in quality persist.",1,1,
86,randomized trial of the effectiveness of on-demand versus computer-guided drug decision support in primary care.,"Objectives: Prescription alerts generated by Computerized Drug Decision Support (CDDS) can prevent drug-related morbidity. However, the vast majority of warnings are ignored due to clinical irrelevance. The ability to customize commercial alert systems should improve physician acceptance because the physician can select the circumstances and types of drug alerts displayed. We tested the effectiveness of two approaches to tailoring medication alerts to reduce the prevalence of prescription problems: on-demand versus computerized decision support. Physicians in each study condition could preset values that triggered alarms. DESIGN: This was a cluster study of 28 primary care physicians who were randomized to receive either automated or on-demand CDDS in the MOXXI drug management system for 3,449 of their patients to be treated over the next 6 months. Measurements: The CDDS generated alerts for prescribing issues that could be customized by severity. Prescribing issues included dosing errors, drug-drug interactions, age, allergy, and disease. Physicians randomized to on-demand activated drug proving if they deemed it clinically relevant, while physicians randomized to computerized decision support enabled all e-prescription alerts according to their selected severity level for both common and common see problems that arise. Data from administrative applications and MOXXI were used to measure the difference in the prevalence of prescribing problems at the end of follow-up. RESULTS: During follow-up, 50% of physicians receiving computer-controlled alarms modified the alarm threshold (n=7), and 21% of physicians in the alarm-on-demand group modified the alarm level (n=3). In the on-demand group, 4,445 prescription issues were identified, 41 (0.9%) were seen through a requested drug review, and 31 issues (75.6%) had the prescription revised. In comparison, 668 (10.3%) of the 6,505 prescribing problems in the computer-guided group were seen and 81 (12.1%) were revised. The majority of alerts were ignored because the benefit was considered greater than the risk, the interaction was known, or the interaction was considered clinically insignificant (computer driven: 75.8% of 585 alerts ignored; on-demand: 90% of 10 ignored warnings). warnings). At the end of follow-up, there was a significant reduction in therapeutic duplication problems in the computer-guided group (odds ratio, 0.55; p=0.02), but no difference in the overall prevalence of prescribing problems. triggered alert systems are more useful than on-demand review in detecting and resolving prescribing problems, but neither approach has been effective in reducing prescribing problems. New strategies are needed to maximize the use of drug decision support systems and reduce drug-related morbidity to reduce.",1,1,
87,randomized trial comparing alternative education interventions to improve colorectal cancer screening in a hard-to-reach urban minority with health insurance,"This randomized controlled trial evaluated different educational approaches to increase colorectal cancer screening utilization in a sample of predominantly non-US-born urban minorities over the age of 50 who have health insurance and are non-adherent to screening guidelines. In one group, participants received printed educational materials in the mail (n=180); in a second group, participants' GPs received academic details on how to improve screening referral and follow-up procedures (n=185);"" in one third, physicians received detailed academic information and participants received customized telephone training (n = 199). Overall, 21.5% of participants (n=121) received adequate screening within 1 year of randomization. There were no statistically significant pairwise differences between groups in screening rate. However, in the over-60s, the detailing and telephone education group had a higher screening rate than the pressure group (27.3 vs. 7.7%, p=0.02). Different types of interventions will be needed to improve early detection of colorectal cancer in the shrinking segment of the population that is not screened.

88,randomized trial of real-world step wedge clusters for exercise facilitation to improve cardiovascular care,"BACKGROUND: Facilitation of practice has been associated with significant improvements in disease prevention and quality of patient care. The Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project aimed to improve the delivery of evidence-based cardiovascular care in primary care practices in a large healthcare region through practice facilitation. Our goal was to assess the impact of IDOCC on compliance with healthcare processes. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized stepwedge cluster study of primary care physician recruitment in private practices in eastern Ontario, Canada (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00574808). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three steps by region. Trainers should visit the office every 3-4 (Year 1 Intensive) or 6-12 weeks (Year 2 Sustained) to encourage changes in exercise behavior. The primary endpoint was mean adherence to indicators of evidence-based care, measured at the patient level. Adherence was assessed using a chart overview of a randomly selected cohort of 66 patients per practice at each pre-intervention year, and at year 1 and year 2 post-intervention. RESULTS: 84 practices (182 physicians) participated. On average, moderators had 6.6 (min: 2, max: 11) face-to-face visits to practices in year 1 and 2.5 (min: 0, max: 10) visits in year 2. We collected chart data from 5292 patients. After adjustment for patient and provider characteristics, there was an absolute decrease in mean adherence of 1.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): -2.9 to -0.9%) and 4.2% (95% CI: - 5.7 to -2.6%). Baseline to intensive or sustainability years. CONCLUSIONS: IDOCC did not improve compliance with best practice guidelines. Our results showed a small statistically significant decrease in mean adherence of questionable clinical significance. Possible reasons for this result include implementation challenges, competing priorities in practice, a broad focus on multiple chronic disease indicators, and the use of an overall index of compliance. These results contrast with findings from previously reported facilitation trials and highlight the complexities and challenges involved in translating research findings into clinical practice.

89,research agenda for quality palliative care,"Palliative care has evolved from a misunderstood term and cautiously viewed by many clinicians to one of the most sought-after services in healthcare systems across the country. This is the greatest possible proof of the field's potential value. However, as demand has rapidly outstripped supply of palliative care professionals (1), the specialty's ability to sustainably provide quality care is paradoxically threatened by its own success. We propose a research agenda organized around 5 key questions on the optimal organization and allocation of limited resources in specialized palliative care to bridge the gap between staff and patient needs. The table provides key considerations and suggested approaches to address each research challenge. Amid a growing body of evidence on the potential value of specialized palliative care (2), we believe that answering these questions is essential to maximize value and inform much-needed guidelines to support such care (3).",0,0,

91,A review of family intervention guidelines for pediatric-acquired brain injury,"pediatric-acquired brain injury (BI) affects not only the child with the injury, but their family as well. Studies suggest that there is an increased incidence of psychological distress from caregivers and siblings after a child in the family has experienced BI. The functioning of the family after BI also affects the child's recovery. Reviewing the literature, we identified seven theoretical clinical guidelines for working with families of children and adolescents with BI. These clinical guidelines are to: (1) select developmentally appropriate interventions, (2) tailor the intervention to the family, (3) provide advocacy, (4) educate injuries, (5) focus on family realignment, (6) appropriately adjust the child's environment; and (7) teach skills to the family and the child. Existing research on family interventions in BI is reviewed in the context of these theoretical guidelines, and empirical support for each guideline is then assessed against specific criteria for empirically supported treatments. Unfortunately, there are very few randomized controlled trials and more research is needed to classify all clinical guidelines as “effective”. In addition, continued research will help educate professionals on specific approaches to use when working with a family of a child with BI. Currently, clinicians and researchers can draw on the existing clinical guidelines to overcome the numerous obstacles that arise from the implementation and investigation of family interventions for pediatric BI.",0,0,
92,review of quantitative studies of adherence to clinical practice guidelines in the field of mental health,"Guidelines for mental health clinical practice have proliferated, but there is little evidence of the extent to which they are actually implemented in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to find and review all peer-reviewed reports published up to the year 2000 that provide quantitative information on adherence to specific mental health guidelines. A literature search revealed 41 relevant studies. These studies were of three types: 26 were cross-sectional studies conducted after publication of guidelines, six were conducted before and after publication of guidelines without a specific intervention (before/after), and nine included a controlled study of a specific intervention. Only 37% were in the mental health field. Adequate adherence was found in 27% of cross-sectional and pre/post studies but in 67% of controlled studies. Successful interventions tended to be complex and required a system redesign or additional resources. Only six of 13 studies (46%) that also measured patient outcome found that better outcome was associated with better adherence to guidelines. Several studies showed that adherence rates returned to pre-intervention levels after the interventions ended. Thus, the evidence suggests that guideline adherence is not high without specific intervention, but that certain interventions (typically multifaceted and resource-intensive) improve adherence. However, the public health challenge is to design and implement interventions that are sustainable in mainstream clinical practice.",0,0,
93,review of evidence of suboptimal adherence to standard/universal infection control precautions by healthcare professionals,"OBJECTIVES: The review examines, from international research: the extent to which practitioners adhere to infection control precautions; the relevant issues considered to be influencing compliance; which strategies have been evaluated to induce positive behavior change among practitioners, and the impact of these interventions. BACKGROUND: Standard/Universal Precautions (UP) are internationally recognized as fundamental to the prevention and control of infection and effective in protecting physicians and patients. However, compliance has been problematic and the use of standard/UPs is suboptimal worldwide METHODS: Literature review identifying relevant evidence using multiple electronic databases, from 1994 to 2006, with a number of key terms used. Data was extracted using key headings, making analysis easier. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were reviewed. Twenty-four related to measuring practitioner compliance and 13 studies evaluating t The impact of a research intervention on compliance. In addition, other studies were included that examined the specific reasons for suboptimal compliance or discussed infection control precautions in general. CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with infection control precautions is suboptimal internationally. The evidence confirms that compliance with certain aspects of standards/UPs varies and practitioners are selective in applying recommended practice. Compliance improves after a structured intervention; however, the research does not indicate how long the intervention affects physician compliance or whether compliance returns to the norm after a period of time. Several reasons for non-compliance are discussed and recommendations are made for the future Research recommended Relevance to clinical practice Sub-optimal compliance has significant implications for staff safety, patient protection and the care environment Infection control teams and researchers need to understand the reasons for non-compliance Consider compliance and create a supportive environment conducive to routine, long-term application of standard precautions.",0,1,
94,review of the literature on remote monitoring technology in incentive-based interventions for health-related behavior change.,"The use of technology (eg, internet, cell phones) to remotely implement incentive interventions for health-related behavior change is increasing. To our knowledge, a systematic review of this published literature is still pending. This report provides a systematic review of controlled trials published between 2004 and 2015 that used technology to implement financial incentive interventions targeting substance use and other health behaviors. To be included in the review, studies had to use technology to achieve 1 of the following 2 goals, alone or in combination: (a) monitoring target behavior or (b) providing incentives to achieve the target goal. Studies also had to examine financial incentives (e.g., cash, vouchers) for health-related behavior changes, be published in peer-reviewed journals, and include a research design that evaluated the effectiveness of the incentive intervention compared to another condition (e.g., non conditional incentives, treatment as usual). Of the 39 reports that met the inclusion criteria, 18 were directed substance use, 10 were directed medication adherence or home health monitoring, and 11 were directed diet, exercise, or weight loss. All 39 (100%) studies used technology to facilitate remote monitoring of target behavior and 26 (66.7%) studies also incorporated technology into remote delivery of stimuli. Statistically significant intervention effects were reported in 71% of the studies reviewed. Overall, the results provide substantial support for the effectiveness of remote incentive interventions for health-related behavior change, which have the potential to increase the cost-effectiveness and outreach of this treatment approach.

95,An overview of the use of laboratory tests: A catalyst for cost reductions and quality improvements in healthcare,"BACKGROUND: Given the role of laboratory testing as a central part of controlling healthcare expenditure, this study intends to examine the overuse of laboratory testing in Iran to pave the way for future interventions. METHODS: Inappropriate laboratory use was assessed in a cross-sectional survey through the retrospective analysis of 384 medical records from a tertiary center. To pave the way for future interventions, overuse tests were classified into two categories, inappropriate and inefficient, and then analyzed. Frequency analysis was used to analyze patient age, gender, hospital ward, length of stay, and diagnosis, as well as inappropriate and ineffective testing. RESULTS: A total of 143 (1.50%) of the tests were inefficient and ordered because of laboratory errors such as hemolysis, inefficient sampling, or absurd results. 2522 (26.40%) of the tests were inappropriate, resulting from failure to meet medical/clinical appropriateness criteria. CONCLUSION: While inappropriate test ordering was more common than inefficient testing, the initial improvement strategy should focus on physicians' test ordering behavior through appropriate teaching strategies, continuous auditing and pedagogical feedback, implementation of health information technology tools, application of laboratory practice guidelines (LPGs) and testing algorithms . Where testing is inefficient, implementation of a continuous quality improvement cycle for laboratory services and training of personnel involved in blood collection is recommended.",0,0,
96,simple intervention to improve hospital antibiotic prescribing,"AIM: To evaluate changes in prescribing behavior after distribution of antibiotic guidelines printed on a 9 x 6 cm laminated card suitable for clipping to a hospital ID card. INTERVENTION: Guidelines for appropriate antibiotic prescribing for 20 common and important pediatric infections were printed on a laminated 9 x 6 cm card that can be clipped to a hospital ID card and distributed to all medical staff. DESIGN: We collected medical record data for three marker disorders (tonsillitis, pneumonia, and orbital/periorbital cellulitis) on patient samples from the 6-month periods on either side of the month in which the cards were distributed. The prescribing physicians were unaware of the study and the researchers analyzed the prescriptions without knowledge of the time period in which they were written. Prescriptions were evaluated for appropriate antibiotic choice and dose. Data on antibiotic costs were also collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of cases where antibiotic choice was appropriate; Proportion of cases where antibiotic dose was appropriate;' annualized cost of third-generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: In tonsillitis, prescribing practice changed little after the cards were introduced. In pneumonia, the number of cases with appropriate selection increased from 77% to 92% (p=0.028) and the number of cases with appropriate dose from 48% to 81% (p=0.001). For orbital/periorbital cellulitis, cases with appropriate choice increased from 19% to 78% (p<0.001) and cases with appropriate dose from 30% to 51% (p=0.11). The annualized cost of third-generation cephalosporins was $193,245 for precards and $89,814 for postcards. CONCLUSION: The maps appeared to have a positive effect on prescribing practice for the three marker conditions. This simple procedure is likely to be inexpensive and useful in reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics.",0,1,
97,simple way to improve adherence to the DVT protocol,"Aim: To assess the impact on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) protocol violations by introducing a label attached to the patient's drug card that specifically allows the prescription of low-dose subcutaneous heparin or anti-thromboembolic stockings (TEDS). Design: An Audit Study. Setting: General Surgery Department of a District General Hospital in the United Kingdom. Method: All adult general surgery inpatients on a weekday were examined. The staff were not warned about the studies. Patient details and risk factors for DVT were noted. Details of the DVT prophylaxis administered were recorded. A total of four separate studies were conducted, namely: with original protocols (I), with refined protocol 1 and 3 years later (II, III) and finally after introduction of the label (IV). Results: Protocol violations were defined as ""acceptable"" or ""unacceptable"". Sensitization between Studies I and II reduced acceptable violations to zero. There was no statistically significant reduction in unacceptable injuries (24 of 80 patients, 1"", 17 of 75, II, 13 of 60, III). In study IV, after the label was introduced, there were only 6 violations in 51 patients (p<0, 02) Conclusion: The combination of increased awareness with the attachment of a label to the drug table reduced unacceptable violations by 63%.",0,1,
98,"snapshot of primary care physician attitudes, levels of confidence, and self-reported asthma management in children","The prevalence of asthma in Australia is high. Previous findings suggest that asthma management, particularly in primary care, remains suboptimal, and recent government initiatives to improve asthma management and encourage the use of written asthma action plans (WAAPs) in general practice have been implemented. Our aim was to assess the attitudes, confidence and self-reported treatment practices of pediatric asthma in a sample of Australian general practitioners (GPs). A baseline questionnaire was administered to general practitioners as part of a randomized controlled trial. General Practitioners (GPs) were recruited from two areas of Greater Sydney, NSW between 2006 and 2008. Invitations were sent out to an estimated 1200 potential GPs. Of 150 (12.5%) participating general practitioners, 122 (10.2%) completed the baseline questionnaire. Although 89% were aware of the Australian National Asthma Guidelines, less than 40% were familiar with the guidelines' recommendations. While 85.2% had a positive attitude toward WAAPs, only 45.1% reported deploying them frequently. 90% agreed to prescribe daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to children with common symptoms, and 83% said they currently prescribe ICS to such patients. These results point to gaps in primary care physician attitudes and behaviors, and highlight opportunities for interventions to improve pediatric asthma management.",0,0,
99,nationwide controlled study intervention to reduce the use of unproven or ineffective breast cancer treatments,"BACKGROUND: Challenged by public opinion, peers, and the Congressional Budget Office, medical societies have begun to compile ""top five"" lists of expensive procedures that do not provide significant benefit to at least some categories of patients for whom they are commonly ordered . However, the extent to which these lists influenced the behavior of physicians or patients is unknown. METHODS: We collaborated with a nationwide consortium of health systems to examine the effectiveness of two interventions: (i) ""basic"" public reporting and (ii) an ""enhanced"" intervention that augments public reporting with a smartphone-based application , the provider provides just-in-time information, decision support, and personalized patient education materials to help reduce the use of eight breast cancer interventions designated by Choosing Wisely(R) or Oncology Society guidelines. Our objectives are: (1) to examine whether basic public reporting reduces the use of targeted breast cancer practices in a current cohort of patients with new-onset breast cancer in the intervention state compared to usual care in comparator states; (2) to examine the effectiveness of the expanded intervention compared to the baseline intervention;"" and (3) to simulate cost savings resulting from the nationwide implementation of both interventions. DISCUSSION: The results will provide rigorous evidence for the effectiveness of a unique public reporting system for provide all payers and all age groups for influencing provider behavior that can be easily exported to other states and potentially large healthcare systems as well.The results will continue to be relevant to the ACO environment, which is expected to create financial disincentives for provides ineffective or unproven care TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number pending.",0,1,
100,study of factors related to cost and variation in prescribing among primary care physicians,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate prescribing can harm both individuals and society. Previous research has identified physician or demographic characteristics that influence prescription variation that could not be changed. OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable factors associated with primary care physician prescribing variability and costs. METHOD: Qualitative research methods were used in semi-structured taped interviews with 17 GPs in Avon, South West NHS Region, UK. RESULTS: GPs considered themselves cautious and conservative prescribers. Prescribing decisions were often justified by the prescribing physician despite conflicting clinical or cost arguments. A personally developed drug formula was used to reduce dilemmas potentially associated with prescription uncertainty. The willingness to reflect on prescribing habits and to measure them against established professional standards varied greatly. The lack of monitoring mechanisms for prescribing decisions, coupled with underutilization of the community pharmacist, led to uncertain prescribing outcomes. Some GPs found it difficult to keep up to date professionally due to time constraints. Excessive patient demand was thought to affect their prescribing, but GPs indicated they were not unduly influenced by the drug representative. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing has significant health and budget implications, yet remains a controversial issue. Improved partnerships between patient, doctor and pharmacist need to be established. Better monitoring of the prescribing decision and support through policy development and educational interventions is needed to reduce prescribing uncertainty. Newly formed primary care groups may need to reflect on the difficulties prescribers face, particularly when prescribing within a limited budget, to avoid conflicts between prescribing behavior and local policy development.",0,0,
101,successful experiment in reducing unnecessary laboratory use at a community hospital,"series of interventions in a 228-bed general hospital provided physicians with periodic feedback on the amount of laboratory services expended in treating their patients. Case-mix-adjusted estimates of laboratory tests allowed each physician to compare laboratory test use to that of colleagues in the same department at the same hospital. Physicians with ""excessive"" practice patterns ordered hundreds more lab tests than average each year. A multifaceted training program included the following: 1) discussions were held on costs and unnecessary laboratory tests; 2) Physicians received descriptions of their practice patterns compared to their peers in large and small departmental discussions; 3) the feedback was repeat one year later; 4) a consensus conference established guidelines for test ordering;"" and 5) a sample of patient charts were reviewed for appropriateness of ordering laboratory tests. A total of 37% of a sample of tests ordered during the baseline period by physicians with ""excessive"" practice patterns were deemed inappropriate The intervention resulted in a reduction of 1.8 tests per patient (P=0.0005) Eight of the nine tests individually showed a reduction in usage Fee data from the target hospital showed a statistically significant reduction in laboratory fees per patient in the quarter after the start of the program (P=0.02) and no evidence of change in a group of five comparator hospitals There was no evidence of cuts in the ordering of essential tests These results demonstrate a cost-effective approach to reducing unnecessary costs , which can be implemented in hospitals with integrated data systems n.",0,1,
102,"survey of tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of primary care providers in Mississippi","Rationale: Compared to other regions in the US, Mississippi has a high prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases. This study examined the tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors of primary care physicians, dentists, and nurse practitioners in the state of Mississippi. METHODS: The Provider Attitude Survey, an 85-item measurement of tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and intervention behaviors, was mailed to all members of the Mississippi family medicine, dentistry, and nursing professional organizations (N=2043). RESULTS: More than a third (n=802, 39.2%) of eligible providers responded. Only 24.3% had received tobacco cessation training and 33.7% were aware of the Public Health Service's clinical practice guideline. Over 90% said it was their job to prevent tobacco use""; felt rewarded for helping patients quit;"" and were concerned and upset about the health effects of tobacco. Doctors cared for more patients than nurses or dentists. Physicians and nurses reported greater self-efficacy, motivation, and willingness to treat tobacco use than dentists. Providers with training performed more interventions and reported greater self-efficacy, willingness, and fewer barriers than providers without training. The training was associated with greater increases in self-efficacy, willingness, and intervention behavior in dentists than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high prevalence of tobacco use and tobacco-related diseases in Mississippi, primary care physicians in Mississippi provide tobacco cessation interventions at an unacceptably low frequency compared to other regions. Training is likely to increase the frequency of interventional behaviors.",0,0,
103,sustainable strategy to prevent antibiotic misuse in acute respiratory infections,"Background Over 50% of antibiotic prescriptions are prescribed for ambulatory patients with Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARI). Many of them are not needed, thus contributing to both preventable adverse events and pressure to develop bacterial resistance. Could a clinical decision support system (CDSS) interposed at the time of e-prescribing align antibiotic use with consensus treatment guidelines for ARI? Methods This is a retrospective comparison of the pre-intervention (2002) and post-intervention periods (2003-2006) in two comprehensive health systems (intervention and control). The intervention was a CDSS targeting fluoroquinolone and azithromycin; other antibiotics remained unrestricted. 7000 outpatient visits flagged by an ARI case finding algorithm were checked for compliance with guidelines (antibiotic prescribed when warranted or not prescribed when unwarranted). Results 3831 patients met case definitions for one or more ARIs: pneumonia (537), bronchitis (2931), sinusitis (717), and non-specific ARI (145). All patients with pneumonia received antibiotics. The relative risk (RR) of congruent prescribing was 2.57 (95% CI?=?(1.865 to 3.540) in favor of the intervention site for the antibiotics targeted by the CDSS; congruence did not change for other antibiotics (adjusted RR? =?1.18 (95% CI?=?(0.691 to 2.011)) The proportion of unjustified prescriptions for the targeted antibiotics decreased from 22% to 3%, before vs. after the intervention (p<0.0001). eradicated unjustified use of targeted antibiotics for ARI for four years This intervention provides a path to sustainable antibiotic use for outpatients with ARI.",1,1,
104,systematic qualitative analysis of psychoeducational interventions for depression in cancer patients,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether research-based recommendations can be made for clinical management of depression in cancer patients. DATA SOURCES: Reports of scientific studies, qualitative or quantitative systematic reviews of scientific studies, and practice guidelines published from 1980-2000. Data Synthesis: A total of 36 pieces of evidence supported the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions benefit depressive symptoms. Evidence included two well-conducted meta-analyses and nine well-designed, large-sample (N>100) randomized clinical trials. Regarding the content of the intervention, 70% of the behavioral therapy studies and 66% of the counseling studies came to conclusions that supported the hypothesis. Additionally, 58% of the studies that tested behavioral therapy or counseling in combination with cancer education had positive results. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the conclusion that psychoeducational interventions reduce depressive symptoms in cancer patients and that behavioral therapy or counseling alone or in combination with cancer education is beneficial. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses may choose from a variety of educational, behavioral, and counseling techniques to help prevent or manage depression in their patients.",0,0,
105,systematic review of clinical decision support systems for antimicrobial management: are we failing to adequately examine these interventions?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for antimicrobial management can assist physicians in optimizing antimicrobial therapy. We reviewed all original literature (qualitatively and quantitatively) to understand the current scope of CDSS for antimicrobial management and to analyze existing methods used to evaluate and report on such systems. METHOD: PRISMA guidelines were followed. The Medline, EMBASE, HMIC Health and Management, and Global Health databases were searched from January 1, 1980 to October 31, 2015. All primary research studies describing CDSS for antimicrobial management in adults in primary or secondary care were included. A thematic synthesis was carried out for qualitative studies. The quality was assessed using the ICROMS criteria (Integrated Quality Criteria for the Review Of Multiple Study Designs). CDSS reporting was assessed against a reporting framework for implementing behavior change interventions. RESULTS: Fifty-eight original articles were included describing 38 independent CDSS. The majority of systems target antimicrobial prescription (29/38; 76%), are platforms integrated with electronic medical records (28/38; 74%), and have rules-based infrastructure that provide decision support (29th /38; 76%). When evaluated against the intervention reporting framework, CDSS studies fail to report accounting for non-competent end-user workflow. They have a narrow focus, such as B. antimicrobial agent selection, and use proxy outcome measures. Clinician commitment to CDSS was low. CONCLUSION: When designing CDSS interventions, greater consideration needs to be given to the factors driving non-expert decision-making. Future work must aim to expand CDSS beyond simply selecting appropriate antimicrobials, with clear and systematic reporting frameworks for CDSS interventions designed to address current gaps identified in evidence reporting.",0,1,
106,systematic review of computerized patient record systems and quality of care: more randomized clinical trials or a broader approach?,"PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of computerized health record systems (CBPRS) on medical practice, quality of care, and user and patient satisfaction. DATA SOURCES: Manual and electronic searches of Medline, Cochrane and Embase databases. STUDY SELECTION: Selected articles were published from 2000 to March 2003. CBPRS was defined as computer software to be used by clinicians as a direct aid in clinical decision-making. To be included, systems should have recorded patient characteristics and offered online counseling or information or reminders specific to clinicians during the consultation. DATA EXTRACTION: The keywords used for the search were: electronic record, informatics record, electronic medical record, electronic medical record, patient order entry, computerized patient system, clinical decision support systems, and assessment. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were selected. The use of a CBPRS was perceived positively by physicians, with satisfaction studies being overwhelmingly positive. A positive impact of CBPRS on prevention was observed in all three studies that examined this criterion. The 12 studies examining the impact on medical practice and adherence to guidelines showed that positive experiences were just as common as experiences that showed no benefit. None of the six studies that analyzed the impact of CBPRS on patient outcomes reported benefit. CONCLUSIONS: CBPRS increased user and patient satisfaction, which could lead to significant improvements in medical care. However, studies on the impact of CBPRS on patient outcomes and quality of care have been inconclusive. Alternative approaches considering social, cultural and organizational factors may be required to assess the usefulness of CBPRS.",0,0,

108,systematic review of faculty development initiatives to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education: BEME Guide #8,"BACKGROUND: Preparing healthcare professionals for teaching is considered essential to improving teaching effectiveness. Although many reports describe various faculty development interventions, there is little research to support their effectiveness. AIM: To summarize the existing evidence on the question, ""What are the effects of faculty development interventions on the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of medical education teachers and the institutions in which they work?"" Period 1980-2002, included three databases (Medline, ERIC and EMBASE) and used the keywords: ""personnel development"", ""in-service training"", ""medical faculty"", ""faculty training/development""; advanced medical education. Manual searches were also conducted. Articles focused on faculty development to improve teaching effectiveness, targeting basic and clinical scientists, were reviewed. All study designs that included outcome data beyond participant satisfaction were accepted. From an initial 2777 abstracts, 53 articles met the review criteria. Data were extracted from six coders using the standardized BEME coding sheet, which was adapted for our use. Each study was coded by two reviewers, and coding differences were resolved through discussion. Data were synthesized using Kirkpatrick's four levels of educational outcomes. Outcomes were grouped by type of intervention and described by outcome level. In addition, 8 high-quality studies were analyzed in a ""focused image"". RESULTS: The majority of the interventions were targeted at practicing clinicians. All reports focused on instructional improvement, and interventions included workshops, seminar series, short courses, longitudinal programs, and 'other interventions'. Study designs included 6 randomized controlled trials and 47 quasi-experimental studies, 31 of which used a pre-test-post-test design. KEY POINTS: Despite methodological limitations, the literature on faculty development tends to support the following findings: Overall satisfaction with faculty development programs was high. Participants consistently found the programs acceptable, useful, and relevant to their goals. Participants reported positive changes in attitudes towards faculty development and teaching. Participants reported improved knowledge of pedagogical principles and gains in teaching skills. Significant gains were seen where formal knowledge tests were used. Changes in teaching behavior were repeatedly reported by the participants and also noted by the students. Changes in organizational practice and student learning have not been widely studied. However, reported changes included greater participation in education and the establishment of higher education networks. Key characteristics of effective faculty development that contribute to effectiveness included the use of experiential learning, the provision of feedback, effective relationships with peers and colleagues, well-designed interventions that follow principles of teaching and learning, and the use of a variety of educational methods within individual interventions. Methodological issues: More rigorous designs and greater use of qualitative and mixed methods are needed to capture the complexity of the interventions. Newer methods of performance-based assessment using different data sources should be investigated and reliable and valid outcome measures should be developed. Sustaining change over time should be considered, as well as process-oriented studies comparing different faculty development strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Teacher development activities seem to be highly valued by participants, who also report changes in learning and behavior. Notwithstanding methodological limitations in the literature, certain program characteristics appear to be consistently associated with effectiveness. Further research is needed to explore these relationships and to document the results at an individual and organizational level.",0,0,
109,tailored intervention to implement guideline recommendations for older patients with depression in primary care: a pragmatic cluster-randomized study,"Background Elderly patients with depression are underdiagnosed, undertreated and at high risk for chronic disease. General practitioners follow clinical practice guidelines to a limited extent. In the international research project Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases, we tested the effectiveness of tailored interventions to improve the care of patients with chronic diseases. In Norway, we investigated this approach to improve adherence to six guideline recommendations for elderly patients with depression, addressed to healthcare professionals, patients, and administrators. Methods We conducted a cluster randomized study in 80 Norwegian municipalities. We identified practice determinants for six recommendations and then tailored interventions to address these determinants. Targeted at healthcare professionals, administrators and patients, the interventions consisted of outreach visits, a website presenting the recommendations and the underlying evidence, tools for treating depression in the elderly, and other web-based resources, including a continuing education course for general practitioner. The primary outcome was mean adherence to recommendations. Secondary outcomes were an improvement in depression symptoms as measured by patients and primary care physicians. We offered outreach visits to all general practitioners and practice staff in the intervention communities. We used electronic software that extracted eligible patients from GP lists. We collected data by interviewing GPs or sending them a questionnaire about their practice for four patients on their list and by sending a questionnaire to the patients. Results 124 of the 900 general practitioners (14%) took part in the data collection, 51 in the intervention group and 73 in the control group. We interviewed 77 general practitioners, 47 general practitioners completed the questionnaire and 134 patients answered the questionnaire. Among the primary care physicians who provided data, adherence to recommendations was 1.6 percentage points higher in the intervention group than in the control group (95% CI -6 to 9). Conclusions The effectiveness of our tailored intervention to implement recommendations for elderly patients with depression in primary care is uncertain due to the low response rate to data collection. However, it is unlikely that the effect was large. It remains uncertain how compliance with evidence-based recommendations, and thus the quality of care, can best be improved for these patients.

110,Teachable Moment Communication Process for Smoking Cessation Conversations: Description of a Group-Randomized Clinically-Focused Intervention,"BACKGROUND: Effective physician-patient communication about health behavior change is one of the most important and most overlooked strategies for promoting health and preventing disease. Existing guidelines for specific health behavior counseling have been created and published but have not been successfully adopted in primary care practice. Building on work focused on developing effective clinical strategies to promote health behavior change in primary care, we developed an intervention aimed at improving clinicians' communication skills to create and respond to teachable moments for smoking cessation . In this manuscript, we describe the development and implementation of the Teachable Moment Communication Process (TMCP) intervention and the baseline features of a randomized group study to evaluate its effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized group study included thirty-one community-based general practitioners practicing in northeast Ohio and 840 of their adult patients. Clinicians were randomly assigned to receive either the Teachable Moments Communication Process (TMCP) smoking cessation intervention or the delayed intervention. The TMCP intervention consisted of two 3-hour training sessions, including didactic presentation, demonstration of skills through video examples, exercises with standardized patients, and feedback from peers and the trainers. For each enrolled clinician, 12 patients were recruited for two time points. Before and after the intervention, data were collected from the clinicians, patients, and audio recordings of clinician-patient interactions. At baseline, the two groups of physicians and their patients were similar across all demographics and practice characteristics examined. Both physician and patient recruitment targets were met, and retention was 96% and 94%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The results support the feasibility of training physicians to use the Teachable Moments communication process. The next steps are to assess how well physicians are using these skills in their practices and assess the impact on patient outcomes.

111,telephone coaching intervention to improve asthma self-management behaviors,"Recognizing that asthma, one of the most common chronic childhood diseases, is difficult to treat, the National Asthma Education Prevention Program has developed clinical practice guidelines to support healthcare providers, particularly those in primary care. However, asthma maintenance care still does not meet national standards. Therefore, in an attempt to improve and support asthma self-management behaviors in parents of children aged 5 to 12 with persistent asthma, a novel telephone coaching intervention for nurses was tested in a randomized controlled trial. A detailed description of the intervention is provided along with parent satisfaction results, an overview of the training used to prepare caregivers, and a discussion of challenges experienced and lessons learned.",0,0,
112,theory of international bioethics: the negotiable and the non-negotiable,"The previous article in this issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal presents the argument that ""moral fundamentalism,"" the position that international bioethics rests on ""fundamental"" or ""fundamental"" moral principles universally accepted across eras and cultures under which a multitude of multicultural and postmodern critiques collapse. This article considers the contractarian tradition of Hobbes and Locke - reinterpreted by David Gauthier, Robert Nozick and John Rawls - for an alternative justification of international bioethics. Drawing on the central themes of this tradition, it is argued that international bioethics can be rationally reconstructed as a negotiated moral order that respects culturally and individually defined areas of non-negotiability. Furthermore, the theory of a negotiated moral order is consistent with traditional human rights ideals, flexible enough to accommodate the genuine insights of multiculturalism and postmodernism, yet strong enough to justify transcultural and transtemporal moral judgments, including condemnation of the Nazi doctors in Nuremberg. This theory is also consistent with the history of the ethics of human experimentation, providing insight into current controversies such as the controversy over changing the consent rule for experiments in emergency medicine and the controversy over the exemption of certain clinical trials of inexpensive treatments to prevent perinatal disease transmission AIDS from the ethical standards of the sponsoring country.",0,0,
113,theory-based educational intervention targeting nurses' attitudes and knowledge regarding cancer-related pain management: a study protocol with quasi-experimental design,"BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common problems in cancer patients. Despite the availability of effective pharmacological treatments, this patient population is often not managed optimally. Research on nurse pain management highlights certain factors such as: B. lack of knowledge and attitudes and inadequate methods for systematic pain assessment, as common obstacles to effective pain management. However, educational interventions targeting caregiver pain management have shown promise. As cancer-related pain is also known to have a negative impact on vital aspects of the patient's life and is often associated with problems such as sleep, fatigue, depression and anxiety, further development of knowledge in this area is warranted. METHODS/DESIGN: In a quasi-experimental study design, it will be investigated whether the implementation of guidelines for systematic daily pain assessment after a theory-based educational intervention leads to an improvement in the knowledge and attitude of nursing staff. Another aim is to investigate whether the intervention targeting nurse behavior improves the pain perception of hospitalized patients. Data on nurses' knowledge and attitudes about pain (primary outcome), patients' pain perception (secondary outcome), along with sociodemographic variables, will be collected at baseline, four weeks, and 12 weeks after the intervention. DISCUSSION: Nursing is now recognized as an increasingly complicated activity and ""the complexity of nursing is such that it can be considered the quintessence of complex intervention"". In order to be able to change and improve clinical practice, several points of attack are required that are suitable for overcoming complex challenges. Consequently, we expect that the theory-based intervention used in our quasi-experimental study will improve care as well as quality of life in this patient population, and we also envision that evidence-based guidelines targeting pain in this patient population will be more widely implemented.

114,tool for assessing a community's capacity for substance abuse treatment,"Evidence-based substance abuse prevention and intervention programs are on the rise. Community needs assessments and health rankings provide descriptions of local behavioral health needs, but do not provide guidance to public health practitioners and policy makers as to the number of programs, health practitioners, or interventions required in the local addiction care system. This article introduces a new framework for measuring and evaluating the substance abuse care system in a community. Assessment can inform resource allocation across the continuum of care to distribute interventions and care more equitably and efficiently. We conducted two literature reviews and combined our findings to create a community assessment methodology and needs calculator, CAST (Calculation for an Appropriate System Tool). We reviewed 212 articles to create an inventory of the community and social correlates of behavioral health, components of a substance abuse care system, and numerical scores for guidelines for estimating community needs. CAST produces community-specific assessments of the capacity of the components of a community-based addiction support system. CAST generates recommendations by applying social and community health determinants as risk coefficients to each component need estimate. CAST can assist public health practitioners in evaluating and improving the capacity of community-based substance abuse treatment systems. By using recommendations for component needs across the care continuum, community leaders can use CAST to prioritize resource allocation more effectively and efficiently.",0,0,
115,universal preventive education intervention for healthcare workers in Sardjito and PKU Hospital in Indonesia,"non-randomized control study was conducted to design and evaluate a culturally appropriate scientific study detailing the intervention on the general knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of health care workers in hospitals regarding precautionary measures. The study involved 55 healthcare workers (44 nurses and 11 doctors). They were visited individually to discuss the principles of universal precautions and the impact of the automatic pilot on their work practices. Self-reported knowledge and attitude measures were collected from each participant before and after the intervention. A care observer recorded measurements of participants' adherence to general precautionary guidelines according to a pre-established protocol before and after the procedure. There were significantly different levels of knowledge, attitudes, and adherence to general precautions between the control and intervention hospitals, with p = 0.0007, p = 0.038, and p = 0.03 after the intervention, respectively. It is concluded that an academic detailing approach to education used in this study significantly improved knowledge, attitudes, and compliance scores.",0,0,
116,cluster-randomized study of decision support strategies to reduce antibiotic use in acute bronchitis,"Background National quality indicators show little change in antibiotic overuse in uncomplicated acute bronchitis. We compared the effect of 2 decision support strategies on antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Methods We conducted a 3-arm randomized cluster study among 33 primary care practices belonging to an integrated health care system in central Pennsylvania. The printed decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support for acute cough disorders through a print-based strategy, the computer-assisted decision support intervention sites (11 practices) received decision support through an electronic medical record-based strategy, and the control sites (11 practices) served as the control arm. Both intervention centers also received clinical training and feedback on prescribing practices, as well as patient information booklets at check-in. In an intent-to-treat analysis, antibiotic prescription rates for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in the winter period (October 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010) after the introduction of the intervention were compared to the previous 3 winter periods. Results Compared to the baseline period, the proportion of adolescents and adults who prescribed antibiotics during the intervention period increased at the printed decision support intervention sites (from 80.0% to 68.3%) and at the computer-based decision support intervention sites (from 74.0 % to 60.7%), but increased slightly at the checkpoints (from 72.5% to 74.3%). After controlling for patient and physician characteristics and clustering observations by physician and practice location, the differences for intervention centers versus control centers were statistically significant (P = 0.003 for control centers vs. intervention centers with printed decision-making aids and P = 0.003). 0.01 for control sites vs. intervention sites for computer-aided decision support), but not among themselves (P=.67 for printed intervention sites for decision-support vs. intervention sites for computer-aided decision support). The changes in overall visits, 30-day repeat visit rates, and proportion diagnosed with uncomplicated acute bronchitis were similar across study sites. Conclusions Implementing a decision support strategy for acute bronchitis can help reduce antibiotic overuse in primary care. The effect of printed vs. computer-based decision support strategies in providing decision support was equivalent.",1,1,
117,Personality and behavior abnormalities in adults (Section F 6) - results of the ICD-10 field trial,"Personality disorders, the main category of Section F6, were examined in the ICD-10 field trial. The overall kappa values for interrater reliability of section F6 are 0.64, for personality disorders 0.61, and for dyssocial personality 0.73. These results are very close to those of the DSM-III field trials. Subjective assessments of feasibility, suitability, and quality of fit show good acceptance of the diagnostic guidelines by clinicians. A comparison of ICD-9, DSM-III, and ICD-10 diagnoses revealed broad agreement for personality disorder diagnoses with overlapping kappa values of 0.91 and 0.94. A number of improvements and the planned introduction of a multi-axis system have increased the acceptance and reliability of the new classification.",0,0,
118,Academic detail does not affect asthma medication prescribing in Danish general practice: a 3-year randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-ups,"BACKGROUND: Educational visits, particularly when combined with social marketing, appear to be a promising approach to modifying health-care worker behavior, particularly prescribing. Results of previous studies have shown a different effect. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of academic detailing as a method for implementing clinical guidelines in general practice. METHODS: A cluster-randomized, controlled, blinded study was conducted on the effect of an academic detail visit versus postal distribution of a guideline for asthma medication prescription. Half of the practices in a Danish county with 100 practices were visited once. Outcome measurement consisted of routinely collected data from all Danish pharmacies on the sale of asthma medication. Data were collected monthly for 2 years before and 1 year after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no effect on post-visit asthma medication prescribing pattern, either immediate or long-term. CONCLUSION: We found no effect of academic detailing as a single intervention.",0,0,

122,Achieving change in primary care - root causes of the evidence-to-practice gap: systematic reviews of assessments,"Background This study aims to identify, summarize, and synthesize literature on the causes of the evidence-to-practice gap for complex interventions in primary care. Design This study is a systematic review of reviews. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO methods were searched from inception through December 2013. Appropriate reviews have addressed the causes of the evidence for the practice gap in primary care in developed countries. Data from included reviews were extracted and synthesized using guidelines for meta-synthesis. Results Seventy reviews met the inclusion criteria and covered a wide range of topics, such as guideline implementation, integration of new roles, technology implementation, public health, and preventive medicine. None of the included papers used the term â€˜causeâ€™ or stated any intention to investigate causes at all. A descriptive approach was often used and the papers included expressed the causes in terms of obstacles and facilitators to implementation. We have developed a four-tiered framework covering the external context, the organization, the professionals and the intervention. External contextual factors included policies, incentive structures, dominant paradigms, stakeholders, infrastructure, and technological advances. Organizational factors included culture, available resources, integration into existing processes, relationships, skill mix, and employee ownership. At the level of the individual professionals, the professional role, underlying philosophy of care and competencies were important. Characteristics of the intervention that impacted implementation included evidence of benefit, ease of use, and adaptability to local circumstances. We posit that the â€˜fitâ€™ between the intervention and the context is critical to the success of implementation. Conclusions This comprehensive review of reviews summarizes current knowledge about the barriers and facilitations to the implementation of various complex interventions in primary care. To maximize the acceptability of complex interventions in primary care, health professionals and commissioning organizations should consider the range of contextual factors and remain aware of the dynamic nature of context. Future studies should focus on describing the context and articulating the relationships between the factors identified here.",0,0,
123,Achievement of guidelines for treating depression in primary care: is medical education sufficient?,"OBJECTIVES: The authors investigate whether continuing medical education has a lasting impact on the treatment of depression. METHODS: Depressed primary care patients initiating antidepressant treatment from primary care clinics of a staff model health maintenance organization were studied. Quasi-experimental and before-and-after comparisons of medical practices, supplemented by patient surveys, served to compare the course of care and depression outcomes. The intervention consisted of comprehensive medical training spanning a period of 12 months. This included individual case advice, didactics, scientific detailing (e.g. clear naming of the educational and behavioral goals for the individual doctors) and role-playing games for optimal treatment. Main Outcome Measures were divided into two groups. Quasi-experimental samples included: (1) choice of antidepressant and (2) appropriateness (dose and duration) of pharmacotherapy. Survey samples included: (3) intensity of follow-up; (4) Physicians delivered educational messages about treating depression; (5) Patient Satisfaction;' and (6) Depression Scores. RESULTS: No sustained educational effect was consistently observed for any of the outcomes measured. CONCLUSIONS: There was no sustained improvement in the management of depression in primary care patients. At the same time, however, guidelines were established for the treatment of depression for intervention patients who participated in a multifaceted cooperative care program during the training period. These results suggest that the continuation of reorganized service delivery programs to support the role of a primary care physician (e.g., on-site mental health staff, close monitoring of patient progress and adherence to therapy) in addition to physician education is critical to success of essential are policy implementation.",0,0,
124,Smoking cessation campaign for suspected tuberculosis (ASSIST) in Pakistan,"Background: Tobacco use is responsible for a large part of the total burden of disease from tuberculosis. Pakistan is one of the 10 countries with a high burden of tuberculosis and tobacco use. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral support intervention and bupropion in achieving 6 months of continuous abstinence in adult smokers with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Design: Cluster randomized controlled study. (Recent controlled studies: ISRCTN08829879) Setting: Health centers in Jhang and Sargodha districts of Pakistan. Patients: 1955 adult smokers with suspected tuberculosis. Intervention: Health centers were randomly assigned to provide 2 short behavioral support (BSS) sessions, BSS plus 7 weeks of bupropion therapy (BSS+), or usual care. Measurements: The primary endpoint was continued abstinence 6 months after the termination date and was determined by the patients' carbon monoxide levels. Secondary endpoints were point abstinence at 1 and 6 months. Results: Both treatments resulted in statistically significant relative risks (RRs) for abstinence compared to usual treatment (RR for BSS+, 8.2 [95% CI, 3.7 to 18.2]""; RR for BSS, 7.4 [CI, 3.4 to 16.4]).Equivalence between treatments could not be established.In the BSS+ group, 275 of 606 patients (45.4% [CI, 41.4% to 49.4% ]) sustained abstinence compared to 254/620 (41.0% [CI, 37.1% to 45.0%]) in the BSS group and 52/615 (8.5% [CI, 6.4 % to 10.9%]) in the usual care group There was significant heterogeneity in program effects between clusters Limitations: imbalances in urban and rural conditions and smoking habits between treatment groups and inability to maintain bupropion treatment adherence to confirm and validate longer-term abstinence or the effect of smoking cessation on tuberculosis outcomes Reason: Behavioral support alone or in combination with bupropion is effective in promoting smoking cessation in suspected tuberculosis.

126,"Acute coronary syndromes without ST segment elevation. From randomized clinical trials to consensus guidelines to clinical practice in Italy, the circle must be closed","Recent therapeutic advances in the treatment of acute ischemic heart disease have been supported by randomized clinical trials and formal practice guidelines. This rigorous approach has resulted in significant reductions in mortality and morbidity across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, contemporary registries of non-ST elevation ACS established by the cardiology community in Italy, as well as in the rest of Europe and in America, have shown limited compliance with the general indication of early treatment of high-risk patients using an invasive approach, protected by the Use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers. This partial failure in the process of improving patient care can be attributed to several reasons, including suspicions that practice guidelines may be skewed by conflicts of interest, concerns about the applicability of clinical trial results to the real world, unrealistic expectations of treatment implications, and finally logistical ones and economic obstacles, including the availability of cath labs and the high cost of platelet receptor blockers. Although the practice guidelines can provide cultural support for translating clinical research findings into patient care, national and local cardiology associations can help raise awareness of the real benefits of an early aggressive approach in high-risk patients, so health care managers should remove bureaucratic roadblocks and reallocate resources from treatments with unproven benefits to those that have been shown to reduce mortality and risk of reinfarction in ACS patients.",0,0,
127,Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and diagnosis by computed tomography,"39-year-old woman was admitted to a maternity ward at 34 weeks pregnant with nausea, vomiting and jaundice. Her condition worsened and she was hospitalized deeply unconscious and hypotensive. The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy was originally suggested by the typical history of prodromal malaise and vomiting and the rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy with severe hypoglycemia and only small increases in transaminase activity. Computed tomography was performed: there was no enlargement of the liver or spleen, but the decimation over the liver indicated significant fatty degeneration of the liver, establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Computed tomography is of value in diagnosing liver disease late in pregnancy, and this technique may become the method of choice for examining acute fatty liver in pregnancy.",0,0,
128,Adding evidence-based interventions to assertive community treatment: a feasibility study,"AIM: This 24-month study, conducted in the Netherlands, evaluated the feasibility of improving the effectiveness of assertive community treatment (ACT) by adding evidence-based interventions. METHODS: A total of 159 patients were randomly assigned to two ACT teams, one standard ACT (N585) and one ACT-plus team that also performed evidence-based interventions (N574): psychoeducation, family interventions, individual placement and support, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy. The interventions were delivered by psychologists and nurses working independently of the ACT team. RESULTS: Although most patients were rated eligible for each of the four interventions (range 65% to 89%), only 12 of the 74 patients (16%) successfully completed an intervention. The results, such as B. the use of inpatient care, for ACT-Plus and standard ACT patients did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia should consider the feasibility of providing evidence-based interventions for hard-to-reach patients.",0,0,
129,Add exercise or subtract sedentary time for glycemic control: where do we stand?,"While regular structured exercise is a well-established (though arguably underutilized) cornerstone in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes, population adherence to recommended exercise guidelines remains stubbornly low. In fact, most adults are exposed to environmental conditions (at work, driving, and in the home) that not only limit their physical activity, but also encourage sedentary behavior for prolonged periods. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that reducing and disrupting sedentary time may also be a useful strategy for improving glycemic control. In this issue of Diabetologia, Duvivier and colleagues report results suggesting that reducing sedentary time through standing and low-intensity activities could be a possible alternative to structured exercise for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We review and discuss the results of this study, their potential clinical implications, and a number of knowledge gaps and opportunities that could be addressed in the interest of future research. Duvivier and colleagues' findings should encourage healthcare professionals, researchers and patients with type 2 diabetes to consider the full spectrum of physical activity, from sedentary behaviors to structured exercise.",0,0,
130,Adding motivational interventions to exercise and traditional physical therapy: a review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Undeniable epidemiological trends suggest that an escalation of chronic lifestyle-related diseases will dominate mortality and morbidity for the foreseeable future. International guidelines recommend the implementation of evidence-based approaches to changing health behavior. Motivational interventions to increase adherence and physical activity are not part of traditional physical therapy for any condition. AIM: To evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of adding motivational interventions to traditional physical therapy to increase physical activity and short- and long-term adherence to exercise regimens. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED, and the Allied Health Evidence database using keywords and headwords. STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized controlled trials comparing two or more arms were included, with one arm focusing on motivational interventions to influence exercise and a control arm. The search identified 493 titles, of which 14 studies (with 1504 participants) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The principal investigator extracted data that was independently verified by another author. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two authors using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the PEDro scale. Outcomes were measured at the impairment, activity limitation, and attendance limitation levels. The standardized mean difference between the control and intervention group at the follow-up times was used as the analysis mode. I2</=50% was used as the threshold for acceptable heterogeneity, above which a random effects model was applied. RESULTS: Training participation was measured in six studies (n=378) and the results show that there was no significant difference in training participation between groups (random effects model, standardized mean difference 0.33, 95% confidence interval - 0.03 to 0.68, I2 62%). Results on perceived self-efficacy were pooled from six studies (n=722) and a significant difference between groups in favor of the interventions was found (fixed effects model, standardized mean difference 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.87, I2 41%). Activity limitation results were pooled (n=550) and there was a significant difference between groups in favor of the interventions (REM, standardized mean difference -0.37, 95% confidence interval -0.65 to -0.08, I (2) 61%). LIMITATIONS: The majority of included studies were of moderate quality and four studies were of low quality. Data from a variety of different populations and settings were pooled, expanding the range of study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Motivational interventions can support exercise adherence, have a positive impact on long-term physical activity behavior, improve self-efficacy, and reduce activity limitations. The optimal choice of theory and the most beneficial duration and type of intervention have not been defined, although all interventions showed benefits. It needs to be determined how practicing physiotherapists are currently optimizing adherence and what their current level of knowledge about motivational interventions is. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY RESULTS: The results indicate that motivational interventions are successful in increasing healthy physical activity behaviors. Physiotherapists are ideally placed to fill this role and motivational interventions need to become part of physiotherapy practice.",0,0,
131,Treatment of nicotine addiction in women. role of the midwife,"Smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other premature deaths among women in the United States. Tobacco use accounts for 10% of perinatal mortality and is 100% preventable. Smoking is now more common among adolescent girls than among boys. Women's healthcare providers are in an excellent position to intervene in this growing epidemic. This article looks at the health consequences of smoking, as well as the social, economic, and emotional impacts of cigarette smoking on women and their families. It examines the reasons why women start and continue to smoke despite known risks. The role of the midwife in the lifelong management of nicotine addiction in women is examined.

Opportunities for professional activities related to community education and advocacy for a tobacco-free society are presented.",0,0,
132,Compliance with NICE guidelines on diabetes prevention in the UK: implications for patient knowledge and perceived risk,"BACKGROUND: The NICE guidelines for preventing diabetes include identifying those at risk, followed by cost-effective interventions if needed. Based on a risk assessment using a questionnaire and/or blood test, the intervention may include a brief discussion of risk factors and preventative counseling or referral for an intensive lifestyle intervention. DESIGN AND SETTING: In this cross-sectional study, 59 subjects recruited from local primary care practices were invited by letter to participate in a screening for a diabetes prevention study. METHOD: After a telephone screening in which subjects were asked if they would be informed if they were at high risk for type 2 diabetes, eligible subjects completed a risk perception survey of developing diabetes (RPS-DD), a validated diabetes risk score and subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) during medical screening. RESULTS: As measured by the Diabetes UK Risk Score, 44.1% were at high risk, 42.4% at intermediate risk and 13.6% at increased risk. 42% of patients were informed by a healthcare professional that they were at high risk. Those who had been informed about their risk had significantly higher perceived risk scores (p<0.001), higher knowledge scores (p<0.001), and lower optimism scores (p=0.004), but were no more aware that diet (p=0 .42) and weight control (p=0.57) may play a role in preventing diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: People at high risk of diabetes are not informed of their risk status as recommended by the NICE guidelines. There is scope for education for health professionals and the public.",0,0,
133,contraception in adolescents,"PIP: Many teens in the United States remain at risk of unplanned pregnancy, despite advances in contraceptive technology and the increasing availability of birth control methods. Physicians caring for adolescents need to be familiar with the different contraceptive measures and their appropriateness for adolescents. A healthcare professional must also be prepared to participate in sex education and to counsel or refer individual adolescent patients when sexual problems arise. In this discussion of adolescent contraception, attention is drawn to: reasons for not using contraception, postcoital contraception, oral contraception (contraindications, side effects, guidelines for use in adolescents and the minipill (progestogen only), IUDs, diaphragms, vaginal chemical birth control, condoms, withdrawal or rhythm, intervention techniques, and choosing the right method. The average teen is exposed to a year or more of unprotected sex before asking for birth control. Available evidence suggests that teens are now using birth control more than ever before, but a significant number do not employ a method for a variety of reasons Most reasons reflect a lack of knowledge, some reflect unavailability, and intense feelings of guilt induced by the idea of the possibility of the sexual en to be prepared for intercourse. Many young people are reluctant to ask private doctors for contraceptive advice or prescriptions because they fear preaching and rejection of their requests. There is evidence in at least 1 study that locating the family planning clinic within the school is effective in reducing pregnancy rates and ensuring high continuation rates at 36 months of follow-up. Intervention techniques that might be effective include providing a method immediately after an event (abortion, childbirth, rape) when motivation is at its highest, and tailoring the method to individual lifestyle and preferences. If there are no contraindications, the teenager should be given the preferred method based on the frequency of sexual intercourse. A backup method should also be provided if the preferred method is not tolerated or never started. To maximize continuation rates, frequent follow-up is essential.",0,0,
134,Overweight and obesity in adolescents - how to best deal with it in general practice,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents continues to increase. Community level management is required as specialized services are limited. AIM: This article outlines a general practice treatment plan for overweight adolescents that uses a chronic care approach and follows the National Health and Medical Research Council's clinical practice guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. DISCUSSION: Overweight and obesity do not spontaneously resolve during adolescence, and active intervention is required to both improve current health and well-being and reduce the risks of premature morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Modest, cumulative lifestyle changes along with modest weight loss goals to reduce the risk of weight gain are important. Any intervention must take into account the rapid cognitive and behavioral changes of adolescence.",0,0,
135,Adolescent violence prevention practices among California pediatricians,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the delivery of violence prevention services by pediatricians to their adolescent patients and to identify factors associated with the delivery of these services by pediatricians. DESIGN: A cross-sectional sample of California pediatricians completed a self-report questionnaire. The Precede/Proceed theoretical model guided the questionnaire in identifying factors related to pediatrician screening and intervention practices in the prevention of adolescent violence. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatricians (54% female, 66% White, 24% Asian, 5% Latino, and 5% other) participated in the study. On average, participants screened their patients for violence-related risk factors 31% of the time when it came to fights, 39% for domestic violence, and 29% for carrying guns. Participants provided their at-risk patients with violence-related interventions less than 50% of the time (on average) by providing the following interventions: written materials, follow-up appointments, disciplinary counseling, or referral to a community organization, child protective services, or a specialized youth clinic. Factors associated with screening practices for violence prevention included the following: positive attitudes and beliefs about screening for violence, familiarity with violence prevention guidelines, use of prompts in medical records, perception of greater ability, and positive reinforcement by patients and peers for delivery of violence prevention services (R(2)=0.44""; P<0.001). Factors associated with violence prevention intervention practices included: positive attitudes and beliefs about screening for violence, availability of resources, and positive reinforcement by patients and peers for delivery from violence prevention services (R(2) = 0.37; ""P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: California pediatricians do not comprehensively screen their adolescent patients for risk factors associated with adolescent violence, nor do they provide interventions for their adolescent patients who may be at risk of violence. The factors associated with pediatricians' implementation of violence prevention services can aid in the development of effective interventions aimed at improving their delivery of these services to their adolescent patients.",0,0,
136,"Adoption, outreach, implementation and maintenance of behavioral and mental health assessment in primary care","PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend screening patients for unhealthy behavior and mental health problems. Health risk assessments can systematically identify patient needs and trigger treatment. This study attempts to assess whether primary care practices can routinely implement such assessments into routine care. METHODS: As part of a cluster-randomized pragmatic study, 9 different primary care practices implemented My Own Health Report (MOHR) – an electronic or paper-based health behavior and mental health assessment and feedback system coupled with counseling and goal setting. We observed how practices integrated MOHR into their workflows, how much additional time it took practice staff to do so, and what percentage of patients completed a MOHR assessment (Reach). RESULTS: Most of the practices contacted (60%) agreed to the introduction of MOHR. How they implemented MOHR depended on the practice's resources, informatics capacity, and patient characteristics. Three practices sent patient invitations to fill out MOHRs online, 1 called patients and filled out MOHRs over the phone, 1 had patients fill out MOHRs on paper at the practice, and 4 had staff members help patients fill out MOHRs online at the practice. A total of 3,591 patients were contacted and 1,782 completed MOHR (reach = 49.6%). Reach varied according to implementation strategy, with greater reach when staff completed MOHR than patients (71.2% vs. 30.2%, p<0.001). No practice was able to maintain the full MOHR score without post-study adjustments. Using MOHR increased staff and clinic time by an average of 28 minutes per visit. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices can conduct health behavior and mental health assessments, but effective patient counseling requires effort. Practices will need more support to implement and maintain assessments.",0,1,
137,Adult education program in palliative care for doctors in nursing homes: conception and pilot project,"Nursing homes (NF) are important places of care for dying patients. NF physicians need curricula that could improve end-of-life care. For this purpose, a model curriculum for palliative care from the medical faculty for experienced NF physicians was modified. Adult learning techniques and interactions that could alter physician behavior were highlighted. Opinion leader involvement, auditing with feedback, use of consensus guidelines, and other techniques to change physician behavior were included. Written materials to complement the course were identified. This new program has been pilot tested and improved. An entrance examination of the medical practices and a survey of the NF staff, a half-day adult education session and a follow-up with the medical director of the NF are proposed. This intervention should be tested to determine whether it improves patient care outcomes at the end of life in this setting.",0,0,

139,Further developing the literature on designing audit and feedback interventions: identifying theory-driven hypotheses,"Background audit and feedback (A&F) is a common strategy to help healthcare providers put evidence into practice. Despite extensive studies, A&F interventions in healthcare remain variable in effectiveness, with overall effect sizes not improving since 2003. Contributing to this stagnation is the fact that most A&F interventions in healthcare have been designed largely without theoretical understanding from the behavioral and social sciences. To determine whether the trend can be improved, the goal of this study was to develop a list of testable, theory-driven hypotheses about how to design more effective H&F interventions. Methods Using targeted sample selection, semi-structured 60-90 minute telephone interviews were conducted with experts in A&F theories from various fields (e.g. cognitive, health and organizational psychology, medical decision-making, economics). Guided by detailed descriptions of A&F interventions from the health literature, respondents described how they would approach the problem of developing improved A&F interventions. Specific, theory-driven hypotheses about the conditions for an effective design and delivery of O&F interventions were raised from the interviews. The resulting hypotheses were assigned to topics and topic categories by three independently working coders in an iterative process. Results We conducted 28 interviews and identified 313 theory-driven hypotheses that were assigned to 30 themes. The 30 themes included hypotheses in the following five categories: A&F recipients (seven themes), content of the A&F (ten themes), delivery process of the A&F (six themes), behavior that was the focus of the A&F (three themes). ) and others (four subjects). Conclusions We have identified a number of testable, theory-driven hypotheses from a wide range of behavioral and social sciences that suggest conditions for more effective A&F interventions. This work demonstrates the breadth of perspectives on H&H from non-health disciplines in a way that provides testable hypotheses for H&H interventions in healthcare. These results will serve as the basis for further work aimed at setting research priorities in the A&F research community.",0,0,
140,Advancing the science of patient safety,"Despite decades of effort, patient safety has slowly improved, in part due to the limited evidence base for the development and widespread dissemination of successful patient safety practices. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sponsored an international group of experts in patient safety and assessment methods to develop criteria to improve the design, assessment and reporting of patient safety practice research. This article reports the findings and recommendations of this group, which include greater use of theoretical and logical models, more detailed descriptions of interventions and their implementation, improved explanation of desired and unintended outcomes, and better description and measurement of context and contextual influences interventions. Using these criteria and measurement and reporting contexts will improve the science of patient safety.",0,0,
141,Benefits and challenges of community-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for elderly depression in rural China: A qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: The delivery of mental health services in rural China is severely constrained due in part to a lack of qualified mental health professionals and other hindering factors. A behavioral therapy intervention by a village doctor can be a way to improve accessibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits and challenges of implementing this intervention, as performed by trained village doctors, for the treatment of depression in the elderly in rural China. Methods: We conducted a focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each village doctor, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The theme guides were benefits and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of village doctors and older adults. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, encoded with NVivo 8 and analyzed with thematic analysis. RESULTS: The village doctors stressed the importance of role play and the use of textbooks in training. Proper mentoring was also an important part of the program. The benefits of the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive, so that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/adopt this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived political consideration) facilitated elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included the lack of real therapy (as opposed to role play) demonstrated in training and the lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other obstacles to the successful delivery of the intervention were the time constraints of the village doctors and the presence of other people when delivering the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if multiple challenges are adequately addressed.",0,0,
142,Advising patients seeking complementary and alternative medical therapies for cancer,"Many cancer patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Physicians need authoritative information about CAM therapies to be able to responsibly advise patients who desire these interventions. This article summarizes current evidence on the efficacy and safety of selected CAM therapies commonly used by cancer patients. The main categories of interventions covered are: diet modification and supplementation, herbal products and other biological agents, acupuncture, massage, exercise, and psychological and mental and physical therapies. Two categories of evidence of efficacy are considered: possible effects on disease progression and survival, and possible palliative effects. When evaluating safety evidence, two types of risks are considered: the risk of direct side effects and the risk of interactions with conventional treatments. For any therapy, the current body of evidence on efficacy and safety indicates whether the therapy is reasonably recommended, accepted (z -dose vitamin A supplementation). This strategy enables the development of an approach for responsible, evidence-based, patient-centered counseling of cancer patients using CAM therapies.",0,0,

144,"Alcohol: prevention, policy and responses in primary care","BACKGROUND: Alcohol is Australia's ""most socially acceptable legal drug"" but alcohol-related harm has increased significantly over time. Promoting safer alcohol consumption should be a national health priority and a focus for health practitioners. AIM: The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the reasons why alcohol is such a popular and valued commodity in Australia and some of the most common problems caused by alcohol. We outline the most effective guidelines and treatment approaches to reduce alcohol use and its associated harms. DISCUSSION: Research suggests that the most effective policies to reduce alcohol use and its associated harms are those that focus on reducing its availability and accessibility."" However, for political and economic reasons, such policies are often not implemented or enforced. Conducting screening and brief interventions are effective ways to address problem alcohol use in primary care and can be further supported by promoting community-organized periods of abstinence.",0,0,
145,Alcohol-Related and Non-Alcohol Activity Participation and Enjoyment Among College Students: An Analysis of Behavioral Theories of Choice.,"College student alcohol abuse remains a significant public health problem, and there is a need for theory-driven and empirically-based models to guide prevention efforts. Behavioral theories of choice posit that the decision to consume alcohol is influenced by the relative value of alcohol compared to other available activities. In the present study, a sample of college drinkers (N=108; 56% female, 44% male) who had previously completed a mandatory alcohol intervention completed a measure of participation in and enjoyment of alcohol-related and non-alcoholic activities. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of drinking amount and contextual variables on activity enjoyment and to identify enjoyable non-alcoholic activities that take place on evenings when students might otherwise be drinking. Overall, students found alcohol-related activities more enjoyable than non-alcoholic activities, and drinking amount was positively related to enjoyment. However, non-alcoholic activities such as watching films, going to the theater or museum, going to bars or parties, hanging out with friends, eating out in restaurants and being creative were generally just as enjoyable as drinking. Alcohol-free activities with peers or dating were more enjoyable than solitary activities. Men were less likely to participate in alcohol-free activities that their peers participated in and reported less enjoyment of alcohol-free activities than women. Further research is needed to identify methods of increasing participation in alcohol-free activities and whether increased participation in alcohol-free activities leads to reduced alcohol consumption.

146,Everything you need to read in the other general magazines,"Between 1998 and 2009, a single surgeon in France reconstructed the genitals of 2,938 women who had been mutilated or circumcised as girls. The case series, one of the largest to date, suggests that surgery can help at least some women with a history of female genital mutilation achieve acceptable sex lives without pain. Most of the women were from French-speaking West Africa, although more than 564 had undergone female genital mutilation while growing up in France. Most of them wanted to be operated on to restore their female identity and autonomy. Four-fifths were also seeking a better sex life. All had undergone female genital mutilation, in which the clitoris was removed or damaged, at an average age of 6 years. One of the goals of the operation was to restore a normal clitoris. More than three quarters of the women who presented for surgery (78% (2053/2613)) had never had an orgasm. Only 866 women (29%) returned for follow-up one year after surgery. About half (414/840) reported an improvement in pain. Slightly fewer reported improvements in sexual pleasure (385/834) and 430 were now having orgasms. We don't know how they felt about their bodies after surgery, and future studies should include validated measures of identity, satisfaction with surgery, and global satisfaction with sex, according to a linked comment (doi:10.1016 /S0140-6736(12)60636-9).

147,Alliance not Compliance: Coaching Strategies to Improve Type 2 Diabetes Outcomes,"PURPOSE: To explore strategies to improve patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes. DATA SOURCES: The literature on type 2 diabetes management, behavior change, communication, diabetes self-management and coaching. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies currently proposed to improve patient outcomes, e.g. B. improving provider adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines, streamlining practice systems, and encouraging patient lifestyle changes through intensive education have yielded mixed results. Of the many complexities associated with managing type 2 diabetes, motivating patients to change behavior is perhaps the greatest challenge. One suggestion to improve patient self-management in type 2 diabetes is the use of coaching communication as part of behavior change in the context of encounters between nurses (NPs) and their patients in primary care. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given the variable outcomes of current strategies, coaching by NPs may represent a viable alternative for improving patient outcomes in type 2 diabetes. Coaching communication can be carried out during doctor visits as a free intervention. However, to effectively implement this approach, practicing NPs and NP students need more formal training in this expected but underdeveloped NP role competency. NPs are encouraged to contribute the knowledge needed to validate the benefits of coaching for their patients.",0,0,
148,Alprazolam prescribing in Tasmania: a dual intervention to reduce inappropriate prescriptions and concomitant opiate prescriptions,"OBJECTIVE: The population rate of alprazolam prescriptions in Tasmania was more than double the national rates. Serious side effects have been observed with concomitant administration of opioid medications with alprazolam. A two-pronged intervention consisting of general practitioner education coupled with changes in prescribing regulations was designed with the intent to reduce inappropriate prescribing of alprazolam and thereby reduce adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the intervention on prescription rates. METHOD: We measured the number of alprazolam prescriptions for the years before and the year after the intervention. Health Insurance Commission data was used to allow a comparison of subsidized alprazolam prescribing rates in Tasmania and compared to national data. The participants were registered physicians in Tasmania who were potential prescribers of alprazolam. The interventions consisted of three continuing education events for general practitioners, one in each of the major regions of Tasmania, in June 2007 on evidence-based interventions in panic disorder. Changes in regulatory procedures to minimize the co-prescribing of alprazolam with opioids were introduced in September 2007. RESULTS: Post-intervention reduction in alprazolam prescribing occurred in Tasmania. Conclusion: Education can be a powerful strategy to influence physician prescribing behavior. It is likely that this effect can be amplified by adopting more stringent regulatory requirements.",0,0,
149,Alternative perspectives on the biased foundations of medical technology evaluation,"Medical engineering assessment aims to improve the care of individual patients (the traditional unit of clinical practice) through assessment studies conducted in patient groups (the traditional unit of clinical investigation). This distinction between individuals and groups has practical relevance to the design, analysis, and clinical applicability of technology assessment studies. We define several biased perspectives on technology assessment that arise from the distinction between individuals and groups: a misguided emphasis on efficacy versus effectiveness, statistical significance versus clinical importance, and objective versus subjective outcomes.

METHODS: The recommendations are based on a careful review of the clinical evidence with a transparent inclusion of subjective factors. RESULTS: There are 9 comprehensive clinical questions with 123 recommendation numbers containing 160 specific statements (85 [53.1%] strong [Grade A]"", 48 [30.0%] moderate [Grade B] and 11 [6.9 %] weak [grade C], with 16 [10.0%] based on expert opinion [grade D]) preparing a comprehensive medical care plan for obesity 133 (83.1%) statements were based on strong (best evidence level [BEL ] 1 = 79 [49.4%]) or intermediate (BEL 2 = 54 [33.7%]) level of scientific support There were 34 (23.6%) evidence-based recommendation grades (Grade AC = 144) based on subjective factors were adjusted.Of the 1,790 reference citations used in this guideline, 524 (29.3%) were based on strong (evidence level [EL] 1), 605 (33.8%) on moderate (EL 2) and 308 (17.2%) based on weak (EL 3) scientific studies, of which 353 (19.7%) based on reviews and opinions (EL 4) CONCLUSION: The final recommendations acknowledge that obesity is a complex obesity-based chronic disease in which management targets both weight-related complications and obesity to improve overall health and quality of life. The detailed evidence-based recommendations enable differentiated clinical decision-making that considers real-world medical care for patients with obesity, including screening, diagnosis, assessment, choice of therapy, treatment goals, and individualization of care. The goal is to facilitate quality care for patients with obesity and to provide a rational, scientific approach to management that optimizes health outcomes and safety.

151,American Cancer Society Survivorship Care Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, and the second leading cause of cancer death when men and women are combined in the United States (US). Almost two-thirds of CRC survivors are alive 5 years after diagnosis. Given recent declines in both incidence and mortality, the prevalence of CRC survivors becomes likely in the coming decades as CRC screening rates increase, further advances in early detection and treatment, and the aging and growing US population increase dramatically. Survivors are at risk for CRC recurrence, new primary CRC, other cancers, and both short-term and long-term side effects of CRC and the modalities used to treat it. CRC survivors may also have psychological, reproductive, genetic, social, and labor concerns after treatment.

153,Statement from the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine: Concussion in Sport,"WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION: PURPOSE OF STATEMENT: black triangle at right To provide an evidence-based summary of best practice to assist physicians in the evaluation and management of sports concussion. right black triangle To identify the level of evidence, gaps in knowledge, and areas that require additional research. MEANING OF AN AMSSM STATEMENT: black triangle at right Sports medicine physicians are often involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. right black triangle Sports medicine physicians are specially trained to treat the entire sports concussion continuum from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. right black triangle Care for athletes with sports concussion is ideally provided by healthcare professionals with special training and experience in concussion assessment and treatment. Competence should be determined by education and experience, not dictated by specialization. right black triangle Although this statement is intended for sports medicine professionals, it may also be helpful to other physicians and healthcare professionals caring for patients with sports concussion. DEFINITION: black triangle right Concussion is defined as a trauma-induced transient disturbance in brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subtype of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) that is generally self-limiting and falls on the less severe end of the brain injury spectrum. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: black triangle at right Animal and human studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered leads to worsening of metabolic changes within the cell. right black triangle Experimental evidence suggests that the brain with concussion is less responsive to normal neural activation, and when premature cognitive or physical activity occurs before full recovery, the brain may be vulnerable to ongoing dysfunction. FREQUENCY: Right black triangle An estimated 3.8 million concussions occur each year in the United States during competitive sports and recreational activities"";"" however, up to 50% of concussions go unreported. right black triangle Concussions occur in all sports, with the highest incidence in soccer, hockey, rugby, soccer and basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT RESULTS: black triangle right A history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of having another concussion. right black triangle Greater number, severity, and duration of symptoms after concussion are predictors of prolonged recovery. right black triangle In sports with similar rules of the game, the reported incidence of concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. right black triangle Certain sports, positions, and individual playstyles have an increased risk of concussion. black triangle at right Youth athletes have longer recovery periods and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic injury. black triangle right Pre-injury-related mood disorders, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder (ADD/ADHD), and migraines complicate concussion diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis of Concussion: Black Triangle Right Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis, ideally made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and skilled in concussion detection and assessment. black triangle right Tiered Symptom Checklists provide an objective tool for assessing a variety of concussion-related symptoms while tracking the severity of those symptoms via serial assessments. right black triangle Standardized assessment tools provide a useful structure for assessing concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools is available. MINOR AREA ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT: Black triangle on the right. Any athlete suspected of having a concussion should be removed from play and evaluated by a licensed health care provider trained in concussion assessment and treatment. right black triangle Detection and initial assessment of concussion should be guided by a symptom checklist, cognitive assessment (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning, and concentration), balance testing, and an additional neurological physical examination. right black triangle While standardized sideline tests provide a useful framework for investigation, the sensitivity, specificity, validity, and reliability of these tests across different age groups, cultural groups, and settings are largely undefined. Their practical use with or without an individual baseline test is also largely unknown. black triangle on the right Balance disorder is a specific indicator of concussion, but not very sensitive. Sideline balance testing may differ significantly from baseline testing due to differences in shoe/cleat type or surface, use of ankle strap or braces, or the presence of other lower extremity injuries. black triangle right Imaging is reserved for athletes suspected of having an intracerebral hemorrhage. right black triangle There is no same-day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with concussion. right black triangle Athletes suspected or diagnosed with concussion should be monitored for worsening physical or mental condition. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS: black triangle at right Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive to subtle cognitive impairments than clinical tests. right black triangle Most concussions can be adequately treated without the use of NP tests. right black triangle Computerized neuropsychological (CNP) tests should be interpreted by healthcare professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and individual test limitations, including an informed assessment of the reliable index of change, baseline variability, and false positives and false negatives Guess . black triangle at right Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, testing different areas and checking for other conditions that may masquerade as concussion or make assessment more difficult. Right black triangle NP tests should only be used as part of a comprehensive concussion management strategy and not in isolation. black triangle on the right The ideal time, frequency and type of NP testing have not yet been determined. right black triangle In some cases, a properly performed and interpreted NP test offers added value in assessing cognitive function and recovery in the management of sports concussion. right black triangle It is unknown whether the use of NP testing in the treatment of concussion associated with sports helps prevent recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury, or long-term complications. black triangle right A comprehensive NP evaluation is useful in the post-concussion management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated trajectories. BACK TO CLASSROOM: Black triangle at right Students need cognitive rest and possible academic adjustments such as reduced workload and longer time on tests while recovering from concussion. BACK TO PLAY: Black triangle on the right Concussion symptoms should be resolved before you return to training. right black triangle RTP progression involves a gradual, incremental increase in physical demands, sport-specific activities, and contact risk. right black triangle If symptoms occur during activity, progression should be halted and resumed at the previous symptom-free step. Right black triangle RTP after a concussion should only be done with medical clearance from a licensed health care provider trained in concussion assessment and treatment. SHORT-TERM RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: Black triangle on the right The main problem with early RTP is reduced reaction time, leading to an increased risk of recurrence of concussion or other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: Black Triangle Right There is increasing concern that exposure to head impact and recurrent concussions contribute to long-term neurological consequences. right black triangle Some studies suggest a link between previous concussions and chronic cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more clearly define risk factors and causes of long-term neurological impairment. DISQUALIFICATION FROM SPORT: black triangle at right There are no evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/removing an athlete from a sport after concussion. Each case should be carefully considered and an individual approach taken to determine disqualification. EDUCATION: black triangle at right Greater effort is needed to educate stakeholders, including athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare providers, to improve concussion detection, treatment and prevention. Right black triangle Physicians should be prepared to offer advice on possible long-term consequences of concussion and recurring concussions. PREVENTION: black triangle on the right Primary prevention of some injuries may be possible through modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. black triangle right Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft (soccer, rugby) are best suited to absorb impact injuries (fractures, bleeding, lacerations, etc.) concussions. black triangle right There is currently no evidence that face masks can reduce or prevent the severity of concussions. black triangle on the right Secondary prevention may be possible through appropriate RTP management. LEGISLATION: Black triangle at right Legislative efforts are creating a unified standard for school and non-school sports organizations related to concussion safety and management. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: black triangle at right Additional research is needed to validate current assessment tools, describe the role of the NP test, and improve identification of individuals at risk of prolonged post-concussion symptoms or other long-term complications. right black triangle Emerging technologies for diagnosing concussions, such as New techniques, such as newer imaging techniques or biological markers, can provide new insights into the assessment and treatment of concussion in sports.",0,0,

155,A detailed scientific intervention to disseminate physician-led smoking cessation counseling: smoking cessation outcomes from the Physicians Counseling Smokers Project,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effectiveness of interventions in disseminating smoking cessation interventions among a population of primary care physicians. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a community-based academic intervention on cessation rates in a population-based sample of smokers. METHODS: This community-based, quasi-experimental study included representative samples of 259 general practitioners and 4295 adult smokers. Over a period of 15 months, physicians in intervention areas were offered a detailed scientific intervention. Analyzes were performed on data from 2346 subjects who reported at least one physician visit over 24 months. Multivariate regression analyzes were performed to determine the impact of the intervention on self-reported smoking cessation rates, as indicated by adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Among smokers who reported a physician visit during the study period, there was a borderline significant effect for those living in intervention areas compared to control areas (OR = 1.35 inches; 95% CI.99-1.83; P = 0.057). Among a subset of 819 smokers who reported a visit to an enrolled physician, we observed a significant effect for those residing in intervention areas (OR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.16-2.75; ""P = 0.008 CONCLUSION: A scientifically detailed intervention to improve physician smoking cessation counseling is an effective strategy for disseminating smoking cessation interventions in community-based practices.",0,0,
156,An administrative intervention to improve the use of laboratory tests within a university hospital,"BACKGROUND: Improving the adequacy of testing behavior and reducing the number of laboratory tests have been identified as essential components of quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of an administrative and short-term educational intervention aimed at reducing the workload of the clinical-biochemistry laboratory. DESIGN: An analysis comparing the use of laboratory tests performed on hospitalized patients before and after the procedure. SETTING: Computerized database of all laboratory tests performed at Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel between 1999 and 2003. INTERVENTION: Administrative intervention included limiting available emergency laboratory tests and frequency of repeat orders. Educational activities included: Discussing the abuse of laboratory tests and its consequences with the hospital's medical staff and presenting the new restrictive policy. Feedback on the results of the intervention was sent to the wards and discussed with senior medical staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in utilization (measured as rates per 100 hospital days) of clinical biochemistry tests by hospital department and by selected laboratory tests. RESULTS: An overall reduction of 19% in laboratory tests (95% CI: 18.8-19.2%) was observed in the year after the intervention. The occupancy rate fell significantly in all medical departments of the hospital and ranged from 14.9 to 43.8%. During the intervention period, the use of hematological tests was reduced by 7.6% (p = 0.009). Statistically significant reductions were found in the order of all 12 selected clinical biochemistry tests. Although total cholesterol orders decreased by 72.2%, the use of ""high volume"" tests, such as glucose and electrolytes, showed only a modest decrease (7.9% and 6.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present study included all hospital medical staff and covered all available clinical biochemical tests. This relatively simple and inexpensive procedure resulted in a significant reduction in orders for clinical biochemistry tests as well as orders for hematological blood tests.",0,1,
157,An assessment of user acceptance and satisfaction with the automated clinical practice smoking cessation policy,"OBJECTIVE: To describe user acceptance and satisfaction with the automated clinical practice guideline (ACPG) on tobacco cessation (TUC) in the Henry Ford Health System. STUDY DESIGN: A previous review assessed adherence to the 5 As (ask, advise, assess, support and arrange) of the TUC ACPG in 3 study arms. This article describes user satisfaction with the TUC ACPG after implementation. Methods: In all study arms, providers completed a survey before participating in a focus group. RESULTS: All providers in the TUC arm reported that they ""almost always"" asked their patients about tobacco use. Providers in the TUC arm were generally satisfied with the features of the TUC ACPG, particularly the ease of electronically referring a patient to the smoking intervention program. Obstacles to use included time constraints, staff shortages, and a desire to ""decline"" the program for patients in certain situations (e.g., patients with terminal illnesses). CONCLUSION: As ACPGs are integrated into electronic health records, it is important to seek vendor input prior to implementation, to provide technology that is user-friendly and fits into the clinic's workflow, and to give physicians autonomy to deviate from the guideline opt out in certain clinical circumstances.",0,0,
158,An automatic rejection rule for the minimum repeat interval reduces the workload and expense of repeat CRP and influences the physician's request behavior,"Objectives Repeated measurements of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) on the same day or on consecutive days are of limited clinical value. Minimum retest intervals are recommended to avoid unnecessary retesting. As not previously reported, we examined the effect of refusing tests with the minimum repeat interval on laboratory workload and expenses, and on physician demand behavior. Methods In a prospective study, we evaluated the effect of an automated 48-hour minimum repeat test interval CRP rule on CRP workload and costs in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Control data on inpatient and outpatient serum urea and electrolyte loads (UE) were collected during the study. Results Over a 1-year period, there was a decrease of 7.0% and 12.3%, respectively, in CRP requirements and analyzed CRP tests after the implementation of the minimum repeat interval rule compared to the 1-year baseline period. This equated to an estimated annual reduction in cost of sales of £10,500 but cash savings in utility costs of £3,000. There was no significant change in UE requests. Conclusions We report for the first time that automatic rejection rules for minimum repeat testing intervals as a standalone strategy is a cost-effective and sustainable method to reduce unnecessary CRP repeat testing, resulting in modest laboratory cost savings, more efficient use of laboratory resources, and standardization of patient care pathways. The minimum repeat interval rejection rule also changed the physician's test request behavior toward a more reasonable request.",0,1,
159,"An educational program that influences health professionals to recommend exercise to their type 2 diabetic patients - understanding the processes: a case study from Oxfordshire, UK","BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity reduces the risk of premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, e.g. B. coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke. Despite this, most adults in England do not meet physical activity guidelines. It is recommended that GPs provide physical activity advice and guidance to at-risk patients. However, education in sports medicine is sparse, resulting in little practitioner knowledge of the evidence for risk reduction and strategies for implementing effective patient behavior change. The Generation Games intervention aims to increase physical activity among the over 50s in Oxfordshire. It offers a Health Professions Education Program (HPEP) that provides training in sports medicine and the promotion of intergenerational play that health professionals can lead patients to. There is a poor evidence base on how such education leads to a change in patients' physical activity behavior. METHODS: The research aimed to gain a better understanding of how an educational program can influence health professionals to recommend Generation Games and improve physical activity behaviors in type 2 diabetes patients. A case study methodology facilitated examination of the routines and cultures studied - the experience of diabetes caregivers was used as an example of best practice engagement with the HPEP. Observation, interviews and documentation were used to triangulate the data. Data analysis refined and developed themes within important theoretical frameworks. RESULTS: First, there is a lack of knowledge about the benefits of risk reduction from physical activity and the belief that efforts to motivate patients to increase their physical activity are ineffective, creating barriers to the incorporation of HPEP. Second, practicing nurses tasked with providing lifestyle advice to diabetic patients – who themselves suffer from a deficit in motivational interviewing skills – find ingrained behaviors associated with physical activity extremely challenging and value the HPEP for providing helpful tools. Third, when patients learn about intergenerational play from a healthcare professional, they may have conflicting expectations of how their physical activity behaviors may change. CONCLUSIONS: Sports medicine education has the potential to improve patient care and services. Before initiatives like HPEP can be successful, primary care practice requires a more supportive culture of exercise medicine. Adequate resource allocation for patient-centred behavior change counseling, training, encouragement and monitoring services is also required.",0,0,
160,An educational approach to improving acute kidney injury (AKI) outcomes: report of a quality improvement project,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a quality improvement project that employed a multifaceted educational intervention to improve the knowledge, confidence, and awareness of the acute kidney injury (AKI) clinician. FACILITIES: 2 major acute care hospitals in England serving a combined population of over 1.5 million people. PARTICIPANTS: All secondary care clinicians working in the clinical areas were addressed, with a particular focus on clinicians working in acute intake areas. INTERVENTIONS: A multifaceted pedagogical intervention consisting of traditional didactic lectures, case-based instruction in small groups and an interactive web-based learning resource. OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed clinicians' knowledge of AKI and their self-reported clinical behavior using an interactive questionnaire before and after the educational intervention. Secondary outcome measurements included clinical review of patient notes before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of clinicians reported knowledge of local AKI guidelines in the preintervention questionnaire compared to 64% in the follow-up questionnaire (chi2"" = 60.2, p<0.001). There was an improvement in the Number of clinicians 50% vs 68% (chi2 = 12.1, p<0.001) reported satisfactory practice in diagnosing AKI and 48% vs 64% in evaluating patients with AKI (chi2 ""= 9.5, p=0.002). Clinical audit manufacturers showed a trend towards better clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement project, which utilized a multifaceted educational intervention, improved awareness of AKI, as demonstrated by changes in clinician self-reported treatment of patients with AKI. Elements of the project have been maintained beyond the project period and demonstrate the power of quality improvement projects to initiate change in practice. Our results are limited by confounding factors and underscore the need to conduct formal randomized trials to determine the impact of educational initiatives in clinical settings.",0,0,
161,An educational intervention reduces the rate of inappropriate echocardiograms in an inpatient medical service,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the impact of an Adequate Usage Criteria (AUC)-based transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) placement training intervention in domestic staff on inpatient general internal medicine at an academic medical center. BACKGROUND: AUC for TTE were developed in response to concerns about inappropriate use of TTE. To date, AUC-based educational interventions to reduce inappropriate TTE use have not been prospectively studied. METHODS: A prospective time-series analysis of an educational intervention was performed and then compared to TTE prescription at the same medical facility during a control period. The intervention consisted of: 1) a lecture to housekeeping staff on the 2011 AUC for TTE""; 2) a pocket map applying the AUC to common clinical scenarios;"" and 3) bi-weekly email feedback on ordering behavior. TTE order was tracked daily during the intervention period and feedback reports were emailed at two-week intervals. The primary endpoint was the proportion of inappropriate and appropriate TTEs ordered during the intervention period. RESULTS: Of all TTEs ordered in the control and study periods, 99% and 98% were classifiable by 2011 AUC, respectively. During the study period, there was a 26 percent reduction in the number of TTE ordered per day compared to the number ordered during the control period (2.9 vs. 3.9 TTE, p<0.001). During the study period, the proportion of inappropriate TTE was significantly lower (5% vs. 13%, p<0.001) and the proportion of appropriate TTE was significantly higher (93% vs. 84%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A simple educational intervention resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of inappropriate TTE and increased the rate of appropriate TTE ordered by an inpatient conventional medical service. This study offers a practical approach to using AUC to reduce the number of inappropriate TTEs. Further studies in other practice settings are warranted.",0,0,
162,An efficacy study of cognitive behavioral therapy in a representative sample of outpatients with psychosis,"OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapies for psychosis (CBTp) has been demonstrated sufficiently to be included in some national treatment guidelines. However, treatment efficacy does not guarantee efficacy in routine practice, where clinical expertise and patient composition may vary. Therefore, we evaluated the applicability, acceptability, and effectiveness of CBTp when routinely offered in a public mental health service. DESIGN: A prospectively recruited representative sample (N=94) of patients with psychotic disorders from a geographic catchment area in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly assigned to CBTp or treatment-as-usual. METHOD: The CBTp intervention included psychoeducation, positive symptom and comorbid problem components. The therapists negotiated goals with the patients and used treatment components from a manual. Intention-to-treat analyzes used baseline, 9-month, and 18-month data. RESULTS: Working group and customer satisfaction measurements showed excellent acceptance. Both groups improved to a similar extent on the Positive and Negative Syndrome scales, with no benefit for the CBTp group. The most commonly implemented CBTp components were comorbid disorders/personal problems and personalized psychoeducation; working with persistent symptoms was the focus of relatively few sessions. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of benefit for the CBTp group may be due to: the infrequent focus on positive symptoms (the most commonly replicated range of outcomes for CBTp); the unselected nature of the patients (rather than those with distressing symptoms or referred by physicians);"" or to inadequate therapist competence.",0,0,
163,An electronic health record-based intervention to improve tobacco treatment in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background To improve the documentation and treatment of tobacco use in primary care, we designed and implemented a three-part electronic medical record extension: (1) smoking status icons, (2) tobacco treatment reminders, and (3) a tobacco smart form that facilitated the ordering of medicines and recommendations for advice by fax and e-mail. Methods We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled study of improvement in improvement in 26 primary care practices between December 19, 2006 and September 30, 2007. The primary outcome was the proportion of documented smokers who had contacted a smoking cessation counselor. Secondary endpoints included coded documentation of smoking status and medication prescription. Results During the 9-month study period, 132,630 patients visited 315,962 study practices. Coded documentation of smoking status increased from 37% of patients to 54% (+17%) in intervention practices and from 35% of patients to 46% (+11%) in control practices (P < 0.001 for difference in differences). Among the 9589 patients who were smokers at the start of the study, more patients were recorded in the intervention practices than non-smokers at the end of the study (5.3% vs. 1.9% in control practices; p<0.001). Among 12,207 documented smokers, more patients in the intervention practices contacted a cessation counselor (3.9% vs. 0.3% in control practices; p<0.001) Smokers in the intervention practices did not receive more smoking cessation drug prescriptions (2% vs. 2% in control practices ;"" P = 0.40). Conclusion This electronic health record-based intervention improved documentation of smoking status and increased counseling support for smokers, but not the prescription of cessation drugs.",0,1,
164,An electronic medical record-based intervention to improve the quality of care in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and atypical manifestations of GERD.,"Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is widespread in primary care but often underdiagnosed and untreated. GERD can also present with atypical symptoms, such as chronic cough and asthma, and physicians may not be aware of this phenomenon. Our goal was to implement and evaluate an intervention to improve the diagnosis and treatment of GERD and atypical GERD in primary care. Method This was a primary care randomized controlled trial using a national network of US practices (the Medical Quality Improvement Consortium - MQIC) that use the same Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Thirteen practices with 53 providers were randomized to the intervention of EMR-based prompts and education, and 14 practices with 66 providers were randomized to the control group with a total of over 67,000 patients and evaluated the outcomes of GERD diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Results In patients who did not have GERD at baseline, new GERD diagnoses increased significantly (p<0.01) in the intervention group (3.1%) compared to the control group (2.3%). This remained significant after controlling for cluster formation with a diagnostic probability of 1.33 (95% CI 1.13-1.56) for the intervention group. For patients with atypical symptoms, patients in the intervention group had both higher odds of being diagnosed with GERD (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.41-2.88) and being treated for GERD (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08-1.83) than in the control group. Conclusions GERD diagnosis and treatment in primary care, particularly in patients with atypical symptoms, can be improved through the use of an EMR-based tool that includes decision support and education. However, there is significant room for improvement when using an appropriate treatment.",1,1,
165,An assessment of opioid prescribing for chronic non-malignant pain by Australian general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the quality of opioid analgesic prescribing for chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP) by general practitioners (general practitioners, primary care physicians). DESIGN: An anonymous, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The setting was five Australian general practice departments (geographically based associations of general practitioners). METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to all department members. Outcome measures were adherence to individual recommendations of locally derived CNMP practice guidelines. RESULTS: We received 404 responses (response rate 23.3%). In the previous 14 days, general practitioners prescribed long-term continuous opioids for CNMP in a median of 4 and a mean of 7.1 (+/-8.7) patients with CNMP. Guideline concordance (GLC) was poor, as no GP always followed all guideline items and only 31% of GPs typically used most of the items. GLC was highest for avoiding high dosages or fast-acting formulations. It was lowest for strategies to minimize individual and public health harm, such as B. the introduction of opioids on a time-limited trial basis, the use of contracts, and the exclusion or management of deviant behavior. GLC was positively associated with relevant education or qualifications, registration with the Australian Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, prescribers of opioid substitution therapy, and female gender. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, long-term opioids for CNMP were frequently initiated without a quality approach to drug use. Possible consequences are inadequate treatment of pain and escalating opioid-related harm. These data suggest a need for improved resource acquisition and education in the use of opioids for pain and addiction.",0,0,
166,An evidence-based guide to writing grant proposals for clinical research,"In 1863, Florence Nightingale argued that London hospitals were dangerous, especially when compared to provincial institutions. She backed up this claim with statistics published in William Fair's Registrar-General report, claiming that 24 London hospitals had mortality rates in excess of 90%, while rural hospitals had an average mortality rate of 13%. Farr had calculated mortality rates by dividing the total number of patients who died over the year by the number of patients hospitalized on a single day. Calculated as the annual number of deaths divided by the total number of inpatients during the year, the mortality rate in London hospitals was 10%. A heated debate broke out in the London medical press about how best to calculate mortality rates in hospitals. Critics claimed Farr failed to adjust for differences in the severity of the disease between urban and rural hospitals and that his numbers mislead the public. Farr and Nightingale, in turn, criticized the poor quality of the hospital data. This story reinforces the need to understand the methodological derivation of statistics used to compare vendor quality.",0,0,
167,An evolving perspective on physical activity counseling by healthcare professionals,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for many chronic diseases and a major cause of premature mortality. An increasing proportion of adults worldwide are not engaging in sufficient physical activity to prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. Healthcare professionals have been identified as a potentially powerful source of influence for those who do not meet minimum physical activity guidelines. Healthcare professionals are respected and expected advisors and reach a large and relevant segment of the population. Despite this potential, health professionals do not routinely encourage physical activity. DISCUSSION: Physicians face several known barriers to physical activity promotion, including lack of time and a lack of perceived effectiveness in changing patients' physical activity behaviors. Additionally, the evidence for effective promotion of physical activity by healthcare professionals is inconclusive. To address these issues, new approaches to physical activity promotion are proposed. These include collaborating with community-based physical activity behavior change interventions, preparing patients for effective brief counseling during a consultation with healthcare professionals, and using interactive behavior change technologies. SUMMARY: It is important that we recognize the latent risk of physical inactivity in patients presenting to clinical settings. Preparing to improve the patient's physical activity behavior should begin prior to the consultation and may include physical activity screening. Healthcare professionals should also identify appropriate community interventions to which to refer physically inactive patients. Outsourcing the bulk of a comprehensive physical activity intervention to community-based interventions reduces the clinical consultation time required to address the issue in each patient. Priorities for future research include investigating ways to encourage successful referrals and then engaging in broader community support programs to increase physical activity in inactive patients. In addition, future clinical trials of physical activity interventions should be evaluated in the context of a broader set of outcomes to provide a systematic view of comprehensive strengths and weaknesses in relation to not only effectiveness but also cost-effectiveness and the likelihood of successful translation of interventions into clinical contexts to allow.",0,0,
168,An experimental study on determinants of group judgments in clinical guideline development,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines to improve quality of care are a familiar part of clinical practice. Formal consensus procedures such as the nominal group technique are commonly used in guideline development, but little is known about factors affecting statements produced by nominal groups and their consistency with research evidence. METHODS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, behavioral therapy, brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy, and antidepressants for irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic low back pain were selected for the study. 16 nominal groups in a factorial design allowed comparison of pure primary care physicians with mixed groups of primary care physicians and specialists, providing a literature review without providing and ratings related to realistic or ideal health care resources. Participants rated appropriateness independently and again after a moderated meeting. Audio tapes from four group discussions were analyzed. RESULTS: 51% of the 192 scenarios agreed with the research results. Agreement was more likely when the group were primary care physicians only, when a review of the literature was presented, or when the evidence was consistent with the clinicians' beliefs. Assumptions about the amount of available resources had no influence. Clinical and social cues had mixed effects regardless of the research findings. The qualitative analysis showed the modifying effect of clinical experience and beliefs about research results. INTERPRETATION: Policies cannot be based on data alone"";"" Judgment is inevitable. The nominal group technique is a method to collect and aggregate judgments in a transparent and structured way. It can provide important information on the level of agreement between experts. However, the conclusions may conflict with the published literature. If this is the case, the reasons must be explicit.",0,0,

170,An experimental study of determinants of the magnitude of disagreement within clinical guideline development groups,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of design features and clinical and social cues on the level of disagreement among participants in a formal consensus development process. METHODS: Factorial design with 16 groups consisting of 135 general practitioners (GPs) and 42 mental health professionals from England. The groups assessed the appropriateness of four mental health interventions for three conditions (chronic low back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome) in the context of various clinical and social cues. The groups differed on three design features: provision of a systematic literature review (vs. not provided), group composition (mixed vs. only general practitioners), and assumptions about available health care resources (realistic vs. idealistic). Deviation was measured as the mean absolute deviation from a group's mean rating for a scenario. RESULTS: None of the design features significantly influenced the level of disagreement within the groups (all p>0.3). Disagreements differed between treatments (closer consensus for cognitive behavioral therapy and behavioral therapy than for brief psychodynamic intervention therapy and antidepressants) and indications (closer consensus for depressed patients and patients willing to try any treatment). CONCLUSION: Concerning the level of disagreement in the groups of this study, formal consensus development was a robust technique because the results were not dependent on the way it was conducted.",0,0,
171,An implementation research agenda,"In October 2006, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of England asked Professor Sir John Tooke ""On the State of Public Health"" in response to the ""Waste not, don't want"" chapter in the CMO's 2005 annual report. The high-level group made recommendations to the CMO to discuss possible avenues to improve clinical effectiveness in the UK National Health Service (NHS) and encourage clinical commitment to achieve this. The report included a brief section on the research needs that emerged from the process of writing the report, but in order to more fully identify the relevant research agenda, Professor Sir John Tooke asked Professor Martin Eccles to convene an expert group - the Clinical Efficacy Research Agenda Group (CERAG ) – to set the research agenda.

172,"An integrated safety, quality and risk management framework: an information and incident management system based on a universal patient safety classification","More needs to be done to improve safety, quality and manage risks in healthcare. Existing processes are fragmented and there is no single comprehensive source of information about what is going wrong.

173,An integrative review examining decision factors influencing mental health nurses' use of restraint,"UNLABELING: WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: There is accumulating evidence highlighting the countertherapeutic effects of the use of restraint and encouraging the minimization of this practice in mental health care. Psychiatric nurses are often the profession that uses restraint, and understanding factors influencing their decision-making becomes crucial. To date, there are no other published works that have undertaken a similarly comprehensive search on this subject. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Eight emerging issues are identified as factors influencing mental health caregiver decision-making when using coercive measures. The themes are: safety for all, restraint as a necessary intervention, restraint as a last resort, role conflict, maintaining control, staff composition, knowledge and perception of patient behavior, and psychological impact “. ""Last resort"" seems to be the mantra of acceptable coercion use, although to date there have been no studies specifically addressing what this concept actually is. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: These findings should be considered when evaluating the use of restraint in mental health settings and appropriate strategies to support the transition to minimizing restraint. As the concept of “last resort” is mentioned in many policies and guidelines at the international level without a published understanding of what this means, research should prioritize this as a crucial next step in efforts to minimize restrictions. INTRODUCTION: While mechanical and manual restraint may sometimes seem necessary as an institutional control method in psychiatric settings, there is emerging literature that highlights the potential countertherapeutic implications of this practice for patients and staff. Nurses are the profession most likely to use mechanical and manual restraint methods in mental health settings. Therefore, in-depth insight is needed to understand what factors influence nurses' decision-making regarding the use of restraints. OBJECTIVE: To investigate what influences mental health nurse decision-making when using restraint. METHOD: An integrative review using Cooper's framework was performed. RESULTS: Eight emerging themes were identified: ""Safety for all"", ""Restraint as a necessary intervention"", ""Restraint as a last resort"", ""Role conflict"", ""Maintaining control"", ""Staff composition"", ""Knowledge and perception of patient behaviour"" and ""psychological effects"". These themes highlight how ethical and safety responsibilities, as well as interpersonal and staff-related factors, influence the decision-making of mental health caregivers. CONCLUSION: Research is needed to better understand the experience and realization of the 'last resort' in the use of restraint and to provide strategies to prevent the use of restraint in mental health settings.",0,0,

176,"An ongoing struggle: a mixed-methods systematic review of interventions, barriers, and facilitators to achieve optimal self-care among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in educational settings","BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes is more common among younger children, often of preschool age, who enter the educational system with evolving diabetes-related support needs over time. It is important that children are supported in optimizing their diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring and insulin regime at school. Young people manage themselves at college/university. METHOD: Theory-based mixed-method systematic review to determine intervention effectiveness and synthesize child/parent/professional views on barriers and facilitators to achieving optimal diabetes self-care and management for children and adolescents aged 3-25 years in educational settings . RESULTS: Eleven intervention and 55 view studies were included. A meta-analysis was not possible. Focus of study Largely coordinated school diabetes counseling. Intervention studies were limited to specific contexts, mostly with a high risk of bias. Views studies were mostly of moderate quality with shared transferable results. Health plans and support from school nurses (various types) were effective. School telemedicine was effective for individual case management. Most educational interventions to increase children's or school staff's knowledge and confidence have had significant short-term effects, but longer follow-up is needed. Children, parents, and staff reported struggling with many common structural, organizational, educational, and attitudinal school barriers. Aspects of school counseling were not generally implemented (e.g. individual health plans). Children recognized and valued school staff who were trained and confident in supporting diabetes management. Research with college/university students was lacking. Supporting campus-based college/university students greatly improved knowledge, attitudes and diabetes self-care. Self-management was easier for students who juggled diabetes management with student lifestyles, such as B. The adoption of strategies to control alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: This novel mixed-methods systematic review is the first to integrate the effectiveness of the intervention with the views of children/parents/professionals matched against school diabetes guidelines. Diabetes management in general could be improved by fully implementing and reviewing the impact of the guidelines. Evidence is limited by quality and there are gaps in knowledge about what works. Telemedicine between health care providers and schools, and the support of children by school nurses are effective in certain contexts, but not all education systems employ nurses locally. More innovative and sustainable solutions and robust assessments are required. Comprehensive lifestyle approaches for college/university students need to be further developed and evaluated.",0,0,
177,An update on the management of the patient with non-ST elevation acute coronary artery syndrome,"Over 780,000 patients in the United States are diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) each year. As physicians, it is our responsibility to promptly screen, diagnose, and treat these patients. After identifying the patient with ACS and confirming that they do not have an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction that requires immediate revascularization, physicians should perform evaluation for non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). It is important to understand the latest best practice guidelines for the treatment and management of patients with NSTE-ACS, who have a high in-hospital mortality rate. Physicians must integrate the history and examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory findings to properly diagnose NSTE-ACS. Even with an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheter and percutaneous coronary intervention, early treatment with guideline-based drug therapy is essential. The focus of this review is to discuss appropriate strategies for evaluating and managing patients with NSTE-ACS based on the most recent ACC/AHA practice guidelines.",0,0,
178,Anesthesia and other treatments for shell shock: World War I and beyond,"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a major health risk factor for military personnel engaged in modern warfare. During World War I, this condition (then known as shell shock or ""neurasthenia"") was such a problem that French doctors began ""forward psychiatry"" in 1915. Some British doctors meanwhile tried general anesthesia (ether and chloroform). others preferred the use of electricity. In 1917, four British ""Forward Psychiatric Units"" were established. Hospitals for shell-shocked soldiers were also set up in Britain, including (for officers) the Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh. Patients diagnosed with more serious psychiatric conditions have been transferred to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. By late 1918, anesthetic and electrical treatments for grenade shock were gradually being supplanted by modified Freudian methods of psychodynamic intervention. The effectiveness of ""forward psychiatry"" has been disputed. In 1922 the War Office produced a report on shell shock with recommendations for preventing war neuroses. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, this seemed to have been ignored. The term ""combat fatigue"" was introduced when failure rates became alarming, and then the value of pre-selection was realized. At Maudsley Hospital, London, in 1940, barbiturate abreaction was advocated for rapid relief of severe anxiety and hysteria using iv anesthetics: somnifain, paraldehyde, sodium amytal. ""Pentothal anesthesia"" and ""narcoanalysis"" were adopted by British and American military psychiatrists. By 1945, however, medical thought gradually settled on the same approaches that seemed effective in 1918. The term PTSD was introduced in 1980. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends guidelines for management (2005).

179,Analgesia and anesthesia for the newborn: study design and ethical issues,"AIM: The purpose of this article is to summarize the clinical, methodological, and ethical considerations for researchers interested in designing future studies in neonatal analgesia and anesthesia, hopefully stimulating further research in this area. METHODS: The MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane registry databases were searched using keywords related to infant, neonatal, neonatal, analgesia, anesthesia, ethics, and study design. Cross-references and personnel files were searched manually. Studies with original data or review articles on these topics were viewed and critically evaluated by experts in the respective subject areas. Data on population demographics, study characteristics, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes were abstracted and synthesized in a systematic manner and refined by the group members. The data synthesis and results were reviewed by a panel of independent experts and presented to a wider audience including clinicians, scientists, supervisors and industry representatives at the Newborn Drug Development Initiative workshop. The recommendations were revised after extensive discussions at the workshop and among committee members. RESULTS: The design of clinical trials investigating new or currently available approaches to analgesia and anesthesia in the newborn requires consideration of study design excellence and ethical issues. Conditions requiring treatment include pain/stress from invasive procedures, surgical procedures, inflammatory conditions, and routine neonatal critical care. Study design considerations must define inclusion and exclusion criteria, a rationale for stratification, the confounding effects of comorbid conditions, and other clinical factors. Key ethical issues include the limitations of neonatal screening, obtaining informed consent, conducting risk-benefit assessments, setting allowances or rewards for participation, safety considerations, use of placebo controls, and differences between the institutional review bodies in the interpretation of federal guidelines on human research. Optimal study design requires investigators to formulate well-defined study questions, select appropriate study designs, assess drug efficacy, calculate sample size, determine study duration, identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, and avoid drug-drug interactions. Specific outcome measures may include assessment on pain rating scales, various biomarkers and their response patterns, process outcomes (eg, length of stay, time to extubation), intermediate or long-term outcomes, and safety parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Much more research is needed in this area to formulate a scientifically sound, evidence-based, and clinically useful framework for the management of anesthesia and analgesia in the neonate. Newer study designs and additional ethical dilemmas can be defined with accumulating data in this area.",0,0,
180,Analysis of investigational drug safety information submitted by clinical trial sponsors,"During the conduct of clinical trials in medical facilities, investigational drug safety information is submitted by trial sponsors in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. The present study examined reports of clinical trials conducted at Tokyo University Hospital, with a focus on the safety information provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). 202 reports (52 protocols) containing safety information were submitted to the IRB by clinical trial sponsors between April 2000 and March 2001, of which 185 contained a total of 3021 adverse event cases. Of these, 194 clinical investigator/physician reports were assessed as not associated with significant problems and the studies continued. For 157 of these 194 reports, it was considered unnecessary to inform subjects about the content of the report, including adverse events. The decision as to whether subjects should be informed about such content or not depended more on the causal relationship between the adverse events and medication intake and the predictability of the adverse events. For 8 of these 194 reports, the IRB recommended that the investigators/physicians provide information to the subjects and/or provide the IRB with detailed information on the status of those subjects. Based on these results, we propose that establishing a system for unifying and assessing drug safety information is necessary to provide safe and efficient clinical trials.",0,0,

INTERVENTIONS We randomized physicians to receive a Palm PDA (which contained the angina diagnostic software) or to continue conventional care. Physicians prospectively charted the treatment process for patients aged 30 to 75 years presenting with suspected angina pectoris over a 7-month period. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Has the treatment process for patients with suspected angina improved when their physicians had PDAs and software? The primary endpoints we considered were the frequency of orders for cardiac stress testing for suspected angina and the adequacy of referral for cardiac stress testing at presentation and for nuclear cardiac testing after cardiac stress testing. The secondary endpoint was referrals to cardiologists. RESULTS The software resulted in greater use of cardiac stress testing overall (81% vs. 50%). The absolute increase was 31% (p=0.007, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8% to 58%). There was a trend toward more appropriate use of exercise testing (48.6% with PDA vs. 28.6% controls), a 20% increase (P=0.284, 95% CI -11.54% to 51.4% ). There was also a trend toward more appropriate use of nuclear cardiology after cardiac exercise testing (63.0% vs. 45.5%), an absolute increase of 17.5% (p=0.400, 95% CI -13.9% to 48 .9%). Referrals to cardiologists did not increase (38.2% with the epidural vs. 40.9%, p=0.869). CONCLUSION A PDA-based software application can lead to improved care of patients with suspected angina in primary care offices"";"" this finding needs to be confirmed in a larger study.",0,1,

183,"Antibiotic prescribing in long-term care settings: a qualitative, multidisciplinary study","OBJECTIVES: To explore the views of healthcare professionals on antibiotic prescribing in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). Using the results to recommend intervention strategies for antimicrobial stewardship in LTCFs. DESIGN: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted. The data were analyzed by thematic content analysis. After the interviews, the emerging findings were mapped to the Theory Domains Framework (TDF), and the behavior change wheel and behavior change technique (BCT) taxonomy were used to recommend future intervention strategies. PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2012 and March 2013, interviews were conducted with 37 health professionals working in LTCFs (10 general practitioners, 4 specialists, 14 nurses, 9 pharmacists). USE: The interviews were conducted in Greater Cork. RESULTS: The main domains from the TDF that emerged were: 'Knowledge', 'Environmental Context and Resources', 'Social Influences', 'Consequence Beliefs', 'Memory, Attention and Decision Making', with the results identifying a need for ""Behaviour Regulation"". Many participants felt that antibiotic prescribing at their LTCF was satisfactory despite a lack of surveillance activities. CONCLUSIONS: Using the TDF and BCT taxonomy, this study found that antibiotic prescribing in LTCFs is influenced by many social and contextual factors. The challenges of the setting and the patient population, the belief in the consequences for the patient and the lack of implementation of guidelines and knowledge regarding antibiotic prescribing patterns are significant challenges that need to be addressed. Based on the study results and application of the TDF and BCT taxonomy, we propose some practical intervention features for antimicrobial stewardship in LTCFs.",0,0,
184,antibiotic resistance,Resistance to antibiotics is economically and physiologically costly. Controlling antibiotic resistance will require the aggressive implementation of numerous strategies. Ongoing surveillance is required to monitor known types of antibiotics and to be able to detect the development of other potential types. Early intervention is required to combat the rising resistance rate. The consistent application of hygiene measures and the controlled use of antibiotics contain the spread of antibiotic resistance. Healthcare providers must monitor compliance with control measures. Hand and environmental control measures remain a critical part of employee training activities. Active management of infections with non-pharmacological treatments should be encouraged. Motivational campaigns will reinforce positive infection control behaviors. Consistent monitoring of antibiotic use will help meet CDC guidance on combating antimicrobial resistance and maintain population health.,0,0,

186,"Sample of antimalarial drug prescribing in government hospitals and selected semi-government hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria","BACKGROUND: Malaria is a curable and preventable disease and a major public health problem in Nigeria. Chloroquine was until recently the drug of choice in its treatment in Nigeria, where artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are being promoted. Inappropriate prescribing, that is, failure to prescribe drugs according to guidelines based on scientific evidence to ensure safe, effective, and economical use, is irrational drug use behavior. Greater benefit from chloroquine or slowing the progression of resistance could be achieved through improvements in prescribing practice, drug quality and patient compliance. OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimalarial prescribing pattern and evaluate the rational prescribing of chloroquine by prescribers in state hospitals and parastatal institutions in Lagos State. METHODS: The study was conducted in all ten state general hospitals under the Lagos State Hospitals Management Board (now Lagos State Health Service Commission), one semi-state hospital and one oil company clinic using patient prescriptions. Over a period of one year (January to December 2000), 100 prescriptions each for adults and children were systematically sampled for each month. If there were fewer than 100 prescriptions in a month, all available prescriptions were used for the analysis. RESULTS: The mean number of medications per contact in all hospitals was 4.259 +/- 0.009. The average number of injections per encounter was 1.215 +/- 0.009. About 48.5% of all prescriptions contained at least one injection, while 40.9% of prescriptions contained a dipyrone injection. The average drug cost per encounter was N 147.40 +/- 0.765. The percentage of encounters with chloroquine was 82.5%, followed by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 14.2%. The percentage of prescriptions with the correct chloroquine dose was 47.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Polypharmacy exists in all hospitals. The average number of medications per contact was over 4 for most hospitals. Less than half of the prescriptions contained the correct dose of chloroquine. This study can serve as a basis for interventions in irrational prescribing.",0,0,
187,Antioxidant vitamin supplement to prevent cardiovascular disease,"Oxidative stress, in particular the oxidative modification of LDL cholesterol, appears to be of great importance in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. Various observational epidemiological studies suggest that intake of antioxidant vitamins is associated with reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Also, experimental animal studies have shown that antioxidant vitamins slow the progression of atherosclerosis. However, prospective controlled clinical trials have failed to demonstrate any benefit of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the use of antioxidants and vitamin supplements cannot be recommended as a preventive or therapeutic intervention.",0,0,

189,Antipsychotic polypharmacy in schizophrenia: benefits and risks,"Antipsychotic polypharmacy refers to the concurrent prescription of more than one antipsychotic drug for a single patient. International surveys of psychiatric service prescriptions have identified the relatively frequent and consistent use of combination antipsychotics, usually in people with pre-existing schizophrenia, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some clinical settings. A common reason for prescribing more than one antipsychotic is to achieve a greater or faster therapeutic response than has been achieved with antipsychotic monotherapy. However, the evidence on the risks and benefits of such a strategy is inconclusive and is generally not considered sufficient to justify a recommendation for its use in routine psychiatric clinical practice. Combination antipsychotics contribute significantly to the prescription of high doses, are associated with an increased burden of side effects, and are of limited value in determining the optimal maintenance regimen for a patient. The relatively widespread use of antipsychotic polypharmacy found in cross-sectional surveys reflects not only the addition of a second antipsychotic to enhance therapeutic response, but also the use of antipsychotics as needed (mainly to treat behavioral disorders) and a gradual cross-titration switch from one antipsychotic to another and supplementing clozapine with a second antipsychotic when the disease has not responded adequately to an optimized trial of clozapine. This review reviews clinical trial data and other evidence for each of these pharmacological approaches. Also reviewed are examples of systematic, practice-based interventions to reduce the prevalence of antipsychotic drug polypharmacy, most of which have had only modest success. The guidelines generally agree that when combination antipsychotics are prescribed for the treatment of refractory psychotic disorders, this should be done after other, evidence-based, pharmacological treatments such as clozapine have been exhausted. In addition, their prescription should be based on an individual study for each patient, with monitoring of clinical response and side effects, and appropriate physical health monitoring.",0,0,
190,Application of a hospital audit to the use of nebulizers: the case of the Hotel-Dieu de France-Lebanon,"PROBLEM: The aim of the study was to reduce unjustified prescriptions of nebulization therapy in order to comply with international guidelines and reduce healthcare costs. METHODS: DESIGN: We conducted a controlled, prospective study to assess the impact of local policies to improve physician behavior on adequacy and cost of implementation. BACKGROUND AND INSTITUTION: All departments of a university hospital: medical and surgical departments, intensive care units, emergency rooms and day wards. KEY CHANGE ACTION: Reducing the number of inappropriate nebulization therapy prescriptions. STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Implementation included two educational presentations, posters posted in all departments, emails to all physicians and residents, and a prescription re-evaluation a week later. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the rate of inappropriate prescriptions was 11.9% (42/358 of the patients treated with nebulizers had no indication for this treatment and 3/19 of the patients had an indication for nebulization but were not treated)”; In the postintervention, the rate of inappropriate prescriptions was 14.6% (15.7% patients with no treatment indication, but no patient with treatment indication untreated), reflecting a lack of significant impact of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The mere presentation of clinical guidelines led not a change in medical practice Effectively improving this outcome requires a different approach.",0,0,
191,Use of the MAT-CHDSP to assess guideline adherence and therapeutic goal achievement in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention,"PURPOSE: Numerous studies have documented suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD(SP)). Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are continually evolving to define appropriate patient care and reduce the risk of morbidity and death. The Medication Assessment Tool for CHD(SP) (MAT-CHD(SP)) was developed to assess adherence to guidelines for medication therapy and follow-up of patients with CHD(SP). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the MAT-CHD(SP) can be used retrospectively to assess adherence to guidelines and the achievement of therapy goals in secondary prevention of CHD. METHODS: We collected electronic medical record data from all patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting from January to March 2008 (n = 300) and applied the MAT-CHD (SP). We measured the time for data collection and MAT application, and tested reproducibility by calculating Cohen's kappa value (kappa) for between- and within-observer agreement. RESULTS: A total of 247 MAT applications were analyzed, showing an overall applicability of 66% of the 4,446 MAT-CHD(SP) criteria and high reproducibility of MAT-CHD(SP) application (kappa values 0.93 and 0.95 for intra- and interobserver) showed agreement respectively). The median time for data collection and MAT-CHD(SP) application was 11 min. Compliance with prescribing criteria was high (>75%), but cholesterol and blood pressure therapy goals were low (<50%). Documentation of lifestyle counseling achieved moderate (50-75%) or low adherence, as did therapy adjustments for patients who failed to meet therapy goals at hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: The MAT-CHD(SP) provides a means to identify both compliance and non-compliance with CHD(SP) guidelines, is applicable in the retrospective assessment of CHD(SP), and identifies potential for improved patient care.",0,0,
192,Applying theory to improve audit and feedback interventions to increase acceptance of evidence-based transfusion practices: an intervention development protocol,"BACKGROUND: Audits of blood transfusions show that approximately 20% of transfusions fall outside of national recommendations and guidelines. Audit and feedback are widely used quality improvement interventions, but the implications for clinical practice vary, suggesting room for improvement. Behavior theory, theoretical frameworks of behavior change, and behavior change techniques provide systematic processes for improving intervention. This study is part of a larger program of work to promote the adoption of evidence-based transfusion practice. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to develop two theoretically improved audit and feedback interventions"";"" one focused on content and one on delivery, examining feasibility and acceptability. METHODS: Study A (Content): A coding framework based on current evidence on audit and feedback and behavior change theory and framework is developed and applied as part of a structured content analysis to specify the key components of existing feedback documents. Prototype feedback documents with improved content and also a protocol describing principles for improving the feedback content will be developed. Study B (Delivery): Individual semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and observations of team meetings at four hospitals are used to specify and ascertain views on current audit and feedback practice. The interviews are based on a topic guide developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Analysis of transcripts based on these frameworks will provide the evidence base for the development of a protocol describing an improved intervention focused on providing feedback. Study C (Feasibility and Acceptability): Improved interventions are being tested in four hospitals. Semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and observations are used to assess feasibility and acceptability. DISCUSSION: This intervention development work reflects the UK Medical Research Council's guidance on complex intervention development, which emphasizes the importance of a robust theoretical basis for intervention design and recommends a systematic assessment of feasibility and acceptability before evaluating interventions in their full randomized trial. The workup includes an indication of current practice so that in the studies to be conducted later in this program there will be a clear distinction between the control conditions (common practice) and the interventions to be evaluated.",0,0,
193,Applying decision architecture principles to understanding HIV testing: Lessons learned from Malawi and Zimbabwe,"Improvements driven by the World Health Organization in prenatal HIV counseling in sub-Saharan Africa from 2004 to 2011 have led to a parallel increase in HIV testing. We sought to determine to what extent the application of architectural choice principles (one that introduces an opt-out option by default) influences HIV testing uptake, beyond attitudes and cognitions at the individual level. Demographic and health survey data were analyzed between 2004 and 2011 from Zimbabwe (N=1,330) and Malawi (N=4,043)—countries where more than 10% of adults are infected with HIV. We examined the influence of demographic variables, forms of knowledge about HIV, stigma of people living with HIV, attitudes towards spousal abuse, and whether or not HIV testing was offered during antenatal visits. Results showed that, accounting for secular trends in higher testing rates, support at the structural level was the strongest predictor of HIV testing, over and above individual-level attitudes and cognitions.

194,Approaches based on behavioral economics could help motivate patients and providers to slow down growth in healthcare spending,"Measures that change the environment or context in which decisions are made and 'nudge' people to make certain decisions have been relatively ignored in healthcare. This article examines the role behavioral economics-based approaches could play in 'nudging' healthcare providers and patients in ways that could slow healthcare spending growth. The fundamental insight of behavioral economics is that behavior is guided by the highly fallible human brain and is heavily influenced by the environment or context in which decisions are made. In policy areas such as pensions and personal savings, approaches based on behavioral economics have yielded remarkable results. In healthcare, such approaches have been used successfully, but in limited ways, such as the use of surgical checklists, which have increased patient safety and reduced costs. As healthcare spending grows at an unsustainable pace, we examine the role that behavioral economics-based approaches could play in offering policymakers a range of potential new tools to slow spending growth.",0,1,
195,Architectural framework: Definition of the structures for the implementation of learning health systems,"Background The vision of transforming health systems into learning health systems (LHSs) that rapidly and continuously convert knowledge into improved health outcomes at lower cost is attracting increasing interest from government agencies, health organizations, and health research communities. While existing initiatives show that different approaches can successfully realize the vision of LHS, they are too different in purpose, focus and scale to be reproduced without undue effort. In fact, the necessary structures to effectively design and implement LHS on a larger scale are lacking. In this paper, we propose the use of architectural frameworks to develop LHSs that follow an accepted vision while being adapted to their specific organizational context. Architectural frameworks are general descriptions of an organization as a system"";"" They capture the structure of its main components at different levels, the interrelationships between these components, and the principles that guide their development. Because these frameworks support the analysis of LHS and allow the simulation of their results, they act as pre-implementation decision aids that identify potential roadblocks and prerequisites for system development. This increases the chances of a successful LHS application. Discussion We present an architectural framework for LHSs that encompasses five dimensions: scientific, social, technical, and ethical goals, which are common in the LHS literature. The proposed architectural framework consists of six levels of decision-making that model these dimensions. The performance layer models goals, the science layer models the scientific dimension, the organization layer models the social dimension, the data layer and information technology layer models the technical dimension, and the ethics and security layer models the ethical dimension. We describe the types of decisions that need to be made within each level and identify methods to support decision making. Conclusion In this article, we outline a high-level architectural framework based on conceptual and empirical LHS literature. Application of this architectural framework can guide the development and implementation of new LHSs and the evolution of existing ones, as it allows for a clear and critical understanding of the types of decisions underlying LHS operations. Further research is needed to evaluate and refine its generalizability and methods.",0,0,
196,Are non-specific practice guidelines potentially harmful? A randomized comparison of the effect of non-specific versus specific guidelines on physician decision-making,"OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of two different clinical practice guideline formats to influence physician prescribing of electrodiagnostic testing in low back pain. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of practice guidelines on physicians' self-reported ordering behavior in response to a series of 12 clinical vignettes. The data are from a national random sample of 900 US neurologists, physical medicine physicians, and general internists. INTERVENTION: Two different versions of a practice guideline for the use of electrodiagnostic testing (EDT) were developed by the US Public Health Policy Agency and the Research Low Back Problems Panel. The two guidelines were similar in content but differed in the specificity of their recommendations. DATA COLLECTION: The proportion of clinical vignettes for which EDTs were ordered for appropriate and inappropriate clinical indications in each of the three physician groups was randomly assigned to receive vignettes only, vignettes plus the non-specific version of the guideline, or vignettes plus the specific version of the guideline policy. KEY FINDINGS: The survey response rate was 71 percent. The proportion of eligible vignettes for which EDTs were ordered averaged 77 percent for the no-guideline group, 71 percent for the no-guideline-specific group, and 79 percent for the guideline-specific group (p = .002). The corresponding values for the number of EDTs ordered because of unsuitable vignettes were 32 percent, 32 percent and 26 percent, respectively (p = 0.08). Pairwise comparisons showed that physicians who received the nonspecific guidelines ordered fewer EDTs for appropriate clinical vignettes than physicians who did not receive the guidelines (p=0.02). Additionally, physicians with specific guidelines ordered significantly more EDTs for appropriate vignettes (p=.0007) and significantly fewer EDTs for inappropriate vignettes (p=.04) compared to physicians with non-specific guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The clarity and clinical applicability of a guideline can be important attributes that contribute to the impact of practice guidelines.",0,0,

198,Are the clinicians of the psychiatric crisis assessment and treatment team at the forefront of psychotherapy?,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited data on the psychological interventions used by clinicians on the Crisis Assessment and Treatment (CAT) team, although practice guidelines dictate that part of their role is to provide counseling. This study aimed to catalog and categorize the spectrum of psychotherapeutic interventions used by clinicians on a CAT team operating in a metropolitan area. METHODS: Self-report, treatment episode data was collected regarding clinicians' views of the type of psychotherapeutic intervention they used and details of what they discussed with patients, as well as the location and duration of the interventions. RESULTS: Thirty-two nursing episodes were cataloged. On average, clinicians spent 74% of their total contact time with patients involved in psychological interventions. A wide range of strategies based on a broad theoretical basis was used. Aside from general approaches that support engagement, interventions could be grouped into the following categories: metastrategy ('treatment about treatment'), 'critical', 'practical', specifically psychotherapeutic (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and others), and supportive. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians saw themselves as spending the majority of patient contact time on psychological interventions that have a broad theoretical basis. Observational studies of what clinicians actually do and empirical research into their effectiveness can have implications for clinician training and supervision.",0,0,

200,Are we adequately preparing the next generation of physicians to prescribe exercise as prevention and treatment? Residents express the desire for more training in the exercise ordinance,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a key intervention for chronic disease, yet few physicians provide a prescription for physical activity (EP). EP is an important component in broader strategies to reduce noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Our aim was to assess the knowledge, competence and perspectives of general practitioners (FMR) to inform future curriculum development. METHODS: A 49-item cross-sectional survey was conducted at 396 University of British Columbia FMRs. Residents' EP knowledge, competence, attitudes/beliefs, current practices, personal physical activity level, and exercise prospects were assessed primarily using a 7-point Likert scale. RESULTS: The response rate was 80.6% (319/396). After eliminating 25 that did not meet the inclusion criteria, 294 were included in the final analysis. A majority of 95.6% of FMRs identified EP as important in their future practice, despite having low knowledge of Canadian PA guidelines (mean score 1.77/4), low self-reported competence in prescribing exercise for prevention (mean score 13.35/21) and self-rating as “somewhat incompetent” and prescribing exercise to patients with chronic conditions (mean score 11.26/21). FMR believe PA is an essential part of their patients' health (98.0%), physical inactivity is harmful (97.9%), and feel obligated to discuss PA with patients (99.7%). Few FMRs (14.9%) found their training in EP adequate and 91.0% would like more. CONCLUSIONS: FMR report EP is important but they are not adequately prepared to provide EP. In future curriculum development, medical educators should consider the low level of knowledge, low competency, perceived support from the program, and their expressed desire for more training in prescribing exercise.",0,0,
201,ARIA 2016: Treatment pathways implementing new technologies for predictive medicine in rhinitis and asthma across the life cycle,"The Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative was launched in 1999 during a World Health Organization workshop. The initial objectives were (1) to propose a new classification of allergic rhinitis, (2) to promote the concept of multimorbidity in asthma and rhinitis, and (3) to develop guidelines with all stakeholders that could be used worldwide for all countries and populations . ARIA is distributed and implemented in over 70 countries worldwide and is now focused on implementing new technologies for individualized and predictive medicine. MASK [MACVIA (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif)-ARIA Sentinel Network] uses mobile technology to develop treatment pathways for the management of rhinitis and asthma by a multidisciplinary group and by the patients themselves. An app (Android and iOS) is available in 20 countries and 15 languages. It uses a visual analog scale to assess symptom control and work productivity, and a clinical decision support system. It is connected to an interoperable tablet for doctors and other healthcare professionals. The scaling-up strategy uses the recommendations of the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing. The aim of the novel ARIA approach is to enable rhinitis patients, regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status, to lead active and healthy lives in order to reduce health and social inequalities caused by the disease.",0,0,
202,Arriba: Effects of an educational intervention on prescribing behavior in the prevention of CVD in general practice,"BACKGROUND: There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of prescribing behavioral modification education to prevent cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the impact of a brief educational intervention on the prescribing of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antiplatelet drugs (IPA), and antihypertensive drugs (AH). DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial with groups of general practitioners (GPs) in continuing medical education (CME). METHODS: Prescribing of statins, IPA, and AH was reviewed at baseline (BL), immediately after the index consultation (IC), and at the 6-month follow-up (FU). Prescribing for high-risk patients (>15% risk of a cardiovascular event in 10 years, based on Framingham's equation) and no prescribing for low-risk patients (</= 15%) were considered appropriate. Results: An intervention effect on prescription could only be determined for IPA. In general, changes in prescribing over time all aimed at higher prescribing rates and remained at FU regardless of risk status and group assignment. CONCLUSIONS: Active implementation of a brief evidence-based educational intervention on global risk in cardiovascular disease did not directly result in risk-adjusted changes in prescription. Studies over a longer period would determine whether such decision support would sustainably improve risk-adjusted prescribing.",0,0,

204,"Assessing the availability of scientific journals, databases, and health library services in Canadian health departments: a cross-sectional study","Background Evidence-based health policy logically depends on timely access to research evidence. To our knowledge, despite significant political and societal pressure to improve the use of the best available research in public health policy and program decision-making, there is no study addressing the availability of peer-reviewed research in Canada's Departments of Health. Objectives To assess the availability of (1) a targeted selection of high-quality scientific journals, (2) bibliographic databases, and (3) health library services in Canada's fourteen Departments of Health. Methods From May to October 2011, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of librarians employed by Canada's Departments of Health to collect information on the availability of scholarly journals, bibliographic databases, and health library services. The availability of scholarly journals in each ministry was determined using a sample of 48 journals selected from the 2009 Journal Citation Reports (Sciences and Social Sciences Editions). Selection criteria were: relevance to health policy based on scope note information on subject categories and journal popularity based on impact factors. Results We found that the majority of Canadian Health Departments did not have subscription access to major journals and relied heavily on interlibrary lending. Overall, based on a sample of top-ranked scholarly journals, the availability of journals via interlibrary loan, online, and print-only subscriptions was estimated at 63%, 28%, and 3%, respectively. Health Canada had 2.3 times more journal subscriptions than the provincial department average. Most organizations provided access to numerous subject-specific and multidisciplinary databases. Many organizations provided access to the library resources described through library partnerships or consortia. No professionally maintained health library was found in four out of fourteen Canadian Departments of Health (ie, Manitoba Health, Northwest Territories Department of Health and Human Services, Nunavut Department of Health and Human Services, and Yukon Department of Health and Human Services). Conclusions There is unequal availability of peer-reviewed research across Canada's fourteen Departments of Health. This inequity could pose a problem, as each province and territory is responsible for formulating and implementing evidence-based health policies and services for the benefit of its population.",0,0,
205,Assessing the impact of national guidelines on the management of children hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis,"BACKGROUND: Acute bronchiolitis is a common condition that accounts for $500 million in hospitalizations annually. Despite the frequency of bronchiolitis, its diagnosis and treatment varies. To counteract this variability, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published an evidence-based practice management guideline for bronchiolitis in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in physician behavior in the management of bronchiolitis before and after the publication of the 2006 AAP bronchiolitis guideline hospitalized with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Pre-guideline diagrams from 2004 to 2005 and post-guideline diagrams from 2007 to 2008 were collected. Evaluation and therapeutic interventions before and during hospitalization were analyzed. Data were analyzed using chi-square analysis for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred thirty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. Rates of diagnostic laboratory tests did not decrease after publication of the guideline. The number of chest X-rays received decreased from 72.9% to 66.7% after guidelines (p=0.02). Fewer children received a trial with racemic epinephrine (17.8% vs. 12.2%, P=0.006) or albuterol (81.6% vs. 72.6%, P<0.0001) according to the guidelines, and physicians were more likely to discontinue albuterol if documented in the post-guideline period (28.6% vs. 78.9%, P<0.0001). Corticosteroid use in children without RAD or a history of asthma fell according to guidelines (26.5% vs. 17.5%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the guidelines, a slight change in physician behavior was observed when treating inpatients with bronchiolitis. Additional education and training for healthcare providers is warranted to reduce unnecessary interventions and consumption of healthcare resources.",0,0,
206,Assessment of treatment-as-usual for control groups in adherence studies: exploring the use of an open-ended questionnaire to identify behavior modification techniques,"OBJECTIVE: Reporting guidelines require detailed descriptions of control group support as well as interventions. However, it remains unclear how to assess the active content (behavior modification techniques (BCTs)) of treatment-as-usual (TAU) administered to control groups in trials. The aim of this study is to pretest a method for assessing TAU in a multicenter cost-effectiveness study of an HIV treatment adherence intervention. DESIGN: HIV caregivers (N=21) completed a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire asking about TAU compliance counseling. Two coders independently encoded BCTs. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Completeness and clarity of nurse responses, intercoder reliabilities, and the types of BCTs reported were examined. RESULTS: The clarity and completeness of the nurses' responses were adequate. Twenty-three of the 26 identified BCTs could be reliably encoded (mean kappa = 0.79; mean agreement rate = 96%) and three BCTs scored below kappa = 0.60. The total number of BCTs reported per nurse ranged from 7 to 19 (M=13.86, SD=3.35). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the open-ended TAU questionnaire is a viable and reliable tool to capture the active content of support provided to control participants in a multicenter compliance intervention study. Considerable variability was observed in the number of BCTs administered to control patients, highlighting the importance of reliable detection and accurate reporting of control group support.",0,0,
207,Assessment and lifestyle management of patients with obesity: clinical recommendations from systematic reviews,"IMPORTANT: Although one-third of US adults are obese, obesity detection and treatment rates remain low. Physician commitment is critical to providing overweight or obese patients with guidance and support to address the underlying cause of many chronic diseases. OBJECTIVES: To describe current best practices for the assessment and management of obesity and how the updated (2013) guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults are based on a systematic review of evidence published by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) can be applied to a single patient. Evidence review: Systematic evidence review performed for the guidelines (2013) on managing adult overweight and obesity supports treatment recommendations in 5 areas (risk assessment, benefits of weight loss, weight loss diets, comprehensive lifestyle intervention approaches and bariatric surgery)”; For areas outside of this scope, the recommendations are supported by other guidelines (for obesity, 1998 NHLBI-sponsored obesity guidelines and those of the National Center for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canadian and US professional societies such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Society of Bariatric Physicians; for physical activity recommendations, the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans); a PubMed search identified recent systematic reviews covering depression and obesity, motivational interviewing for weight management, metabolic adaptation to weight loss, and pharmacotherapy of obesity. Step in Managing Obesity aims to screen all adults for overweight and obesity. A medical history should be taken that examines the multiple determinants of obesity, including diet and exercise patterns, psychosocial factors, drugs used to gain weight, and family characteristics. Emphasizing the complications of obesity to identify patients who will benefit most from treatment is more useful than using body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) alone for treatment decisions . The guidelines (2013) recommend that physicians provide patients who would benefit from weight loss (either BMI >/=30 with or without comorbidities or >/=25 with 1 comorbidity or risk factor) an intensive, multi-component behavioral intervention offer. Some clinicians do this in their GP offices; others refer patients for these services. Weight loss is achieved by creating a negative energy balance through changes in diet and exercise. The guidelines (2013) advocate comprehensive lifestyle management through intensive intervention. Treatment can be provided either in a doctor's office or by referral to a registered dietitian or commercial weight loss program. The usual goal is a 5% to 10% weight loss. It is not required that patients achieve a BMI of less than 25 to. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Screening and assessment of patients for obesity, followed by initiation or referral of treatment, should be integrated into primary care practice when clinicians appropriate patients for weight loss and be able to provide informed advice and support on how to achieve and maintain modest weight loss, they will address the underlying driver of many coma related disorders and can have a major impact on patient health outcomes.",0,0,
208,Evaluation of a distant collaborative program for the treatment of depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Primary care teams play an important role in the management of depression, the effectiveness of which is enhanced when inserted into a collaborative model of disease management. AIM: Report on the results of a clinical study conducted to test the effectiveness of a collaborative program between primary health teams and specialists, supported by an electronic platform. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Physicians from four community hospitals belonging to the Reloncavi Health Service network recruited 81 patients with depression aged 37 to 43 years, 84% of whom were female. Participants were divided into an active group, which participated in the collaborative program, and a control group, which received usual treatment per Department of Health guidelines for depression. The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) score after three months of intervention. RESULTS: Participants had a mean BDI-I score of 29.6 (95% CI: 27.6-31.6) and 38% of them had a high risk of suicide. There were no statistically significant baseline differences between the active and control groups. In the intervention group, the BDI-I score changed from 30.0 (95% CI 27.0 to 32.8) to 15.3 (95% CI 11.8 to 18.8). In the control group, the score changed from 29.2 (95% CI: 26.4-31.9) points to 20.8 (95% CI: 16.8-24.7). The decline was significantly higher in the intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: A program of this type can be useful in assisting primary care teams in remote areas of the country to improve treatment outcomes for depression.",0,0,
209,Evaluation of a pay-for-performance program in primary care designed by target groups.,"Background: Over the past decade, evidence for performance-related pay (P4P) has been sought as financial incentives to influence healthcare professional behavior and improve quality of care have increased. The effectiveness of P4P is inconclusive, although some reviews have reported significant effects. Aim: Assess changes in performance after implementation of a participatory P4P program. Design: An observational study with a pre- and post-measurement. Environment and topics: 65 general practitioner practices in the south of the Netherlands. Intervention: A P4P program developed by target users that includes indicators of chronic care, prevention, practice management, and patient experience (functioning of the general practitioner [GP] and organization of care). Quality indicators were calculated for each practice. By comparing the performance of the practice with a benchmark, a maximum bonus of 6890 euros per 1000 patients was determined. Key Outcome Parameters: Quality indicators for clinical care (process and outcome) and patient experience. Results: We included 60 practices. At one year, there was a significant improvement in process indicators for all chronic conditions, ranging from +7.9% improvement in cardiovascular risk management to +11.5% in asthma. Five outcome indicators improved significantly, as did patients' experiences of how GPs work and how care is organized. No significant improvements were seen in influenza vaccination coverage and cervical cancer screening utilization. The clinical process and outcome indicators as well as the patient experience indicators were influenced by baseline measures. Smaller practices showed more improvements. Conclusions: A participatory P4P program could stimulate quality improvement in clinical care and improve patients' experiences of how family doctors work and how care is organized.

210,Assessing decision support for ordering blood tests in primary care. a randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Various methods of changing blood test ordering behavior in primary care have been shown to be effective. However, randomized studies comparing these methods are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of two versions of BloodLink, a computerized clinical decision support system, on ordering blood tests from general practitioners. DESIGN: Randomized study. SETTING: 44 practices of general practitioners in the Delft region, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 60 general practitioners in 44 practices who use computerized patient records in their practices. INTERVENTION: After stratification into individual and group practices, practices were randomly assigned to use BloodLink-Restricted, which initially displays a reduced list of tests, or BloodLink-Guideline, which is based on guidelines from the Dutch College of General Practitioners. MEASUREMENTS: Average number of blood tests ordered per order form per practice. RESULTS: GPs using BloodLink-Guideline requested, on average, 20% fewer tests than physicians using BloodLink-Restricted (mean [+/-SD], 5.5 +/- 0.9 tests vs. 6.9+ /- 1.6 tests) ;"" P = 0.003, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-based decision aids are more effective in changing blood test ordering behavior than decision aids based on the initial display of a limited number of tests Guideline-driven decision support systems can effectively reduce the number of laboratory tests ordered by GPs.",1,1,
211,Evaluation of radiological referral practice and effect of computerized guidelines on radiological needs in two emergency departments.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate referral practices in emergency medical radiology compared to a set of French guidelines and to measure the efficiency of computerized guidelines for unnecessary medical imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All radiological queries were computerized in the emergency medical departments of two French teaching hospitals. Radiological inquiries were recorded during the control periods, but no action was taken. During the intervention periods, on-screen reminders displayed the appropriate recommendations. Three control and three intervention periods of 1 month each were carried out. The percentage of applications that did not meet the guidelines and the deviations in relation to control and intervention periods were measured. RESULTS: The proportion of requests that did not follow the guidelines was 33 x 2% when the guidelines were inactive and decreased to 26 x 9% when the recommendations were active (p < 0 x 0001). The three imaging tests (chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray and brain CT) accounted for more than 80% of all inquiries; more than 50% of requests for abdominal X-rays did not conform to recommendations, while this percentage was 24 x 9% and 15 x 8% for chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) of the brain, respectively. Seven situations accounted for 70% of non-compliant radiological referrals out, in these situations the knowledge of the young doctors was insufficient. CONCLUSION: While the computer provided advice tailored to the needs of individual patients, at the same time as the care, the effect of our intervention was weak. However, our study identified the few situations that accounted for the majority of unnecessary radiological inquiries."" We expect that this result could help clinicians and radiologists to develop more specific interventions for these situations. Karton, M. et al. (2002) Clinical Radiology (2002) 57, 123-128.",1,1,
212,Assessing Self-Injury in an Accident and EMS - the development of a form for assessing suicidal intent and mental status in individuals presenting to the emergency department with self-harm,"INTRODUCTION: The UK has one of the highest rates of self-harm in Europe, approximately 400 per 100,000 population (Horrocks et al. 2002). It accounts for 150,000 emergency department visits each year and is one of the top five reasons for acute medical admissions in the UK (NICE 2002). OBJECTIVES: Objectives included to examine the method of self-harm and the demographics of those presenting self-harm to the emergency department. In addition, we wanted to review the emergency department physician's assessment of suicidal risk factors and suicidal intent, and whether a psychiatric evaluation was performed with a full assessment of mental status, with referral to psychiatric services if deemed necessary. We wanted to examine current practice regarding self-harm presentations in the ED, according to NICE guidelines. METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from February to August 2009. 25 sets of medical notes were randomly compiled for patients who presented to the emergency department with self-harm. The notes were reviewed for evidence of the investigation of the event, psychiatric assessment, risk factors for suicide, and further referrals. RESULTS: 14 of the 25 patients presented had taken an overdose. 9 had inflicted another form of self-harm, namely lacerations on themselves. A mixed presentation was found in 2 cases. A psychiatric history was documented in 16 cases. 11 had a history of depression or anxiety disorders"", 1 had a known history of bipolar disorder, 1 had a past diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, and 3 patients had no history. In 9 cases, the history was undocumented. DISCUSSION : As of February through August 2009, twenty-five sets of medical records were reviewed from people presenting to the emergency department with self-harm. Of these, 12 were in the age group over 25. 17 were women and 8 were men. The majority of patients were White British ancestry. 14 had one Took an overdose; 9 had committed some other form of self-harm;"" and 2 had a mixed presentation. Suicide risk factors and suicidal intent were poorly documented, with mental status assessment found to be undocumented in all 25 cases studied. 18 were admitted to the emergency department a Declared medically fit and referred for psychiatric evaluation. These unfortunate findings could be due to the time pressures physicians face in the emergency department, namely the four-hour target, and possibly a lack of adequate training in psychosocial risk assessment. As a result of this poor documentation by the emergency department physicians, a form was created that included suicidal risk factors and the assessment of suicidal intent, in addition to a brief version of the mental status assessment. CONCLUSION: The recent Royal College of Psychiatrists report on self-harm has raised concerns that current levels of care for service users fall below the standards set in policies and guidelines, with poor ratings, unskilled staff and inadequate pathways of care (Royal College of Psychiatrists, Report CR 158 , 2010). Indeed, evidence suggests that appropriate training and intervention of emergency department staff can improve the quality of the psychosocial assessment of patients with intentional self-harm (Crawford et al. 1998).",0,0,
213,Assessing the potential effects of a recall system on reducing diagnostic error: a quasi-experimental study,"Background Computer-aided decision support systems (DSS) have primarily focused on improving clinicians' diagnostic accuracy in unusual and challenging cases. However, since diagnostic omission errors can predominantly result from incomplete workup in clinical routine, providing appropriate patient- and context-specific reminders may have a greater impact on patient safety. In this experimental study, a mix of easy and difficult simulated cases was used to assess the impact of a novel diagnostic reminder system (ISABEL) on the quality of clinical decisions made by different stages of clinicians during acute assessment. Methods Subjects of various grades (consultants, registrars, senior house officers and medical students) evaluated a balanced panel of 24 simulated cases on a test website. Subjects recorded their clinical decisions for the cases (differential diagnosis, test design, and treatment) before and after the system consultation. A panel of two pediatric consultants independently provided gold-standard responses for each case, against which the subjects' decision quality was measured. The primary endpoint was the change in the number of diagnostic omission errors (DEO). A more sensitive assessment of the system's impact was achieved using specific quality scores; in addition, the additional consultation time due to DSS usage was calculated. Results Seventy-six subjects (18 consultants, 24 registrars, 19 senior house officers, and 15 students) completed a total of 751 case episodes. The mean number of DEO fell from 5.5 to 5.0 in all subjects (repeated measures ANOVA, p<0.001); no significant interaction with subject grade was noted. The mean diagnostic quality score increased after system consultation (0.044; 95% confidence interval 0.032, 0.054). ISABEL reminded subjects to consider at least one clinically important diagnosis in 1 out of 8 case episodes and asked them to order an important test in 1 out of 10 case episodes. The median additional time for the DSS consultation was 1 minute (IQR: 30 seconds to 2 minutes). Conclusion The provision of patient- and context-specific reminders has the potential to reduce diagnostic omissions across all subject levels for a range of cases. This study suggests a promising role for the use of future memory-based DSS in reducing diagnostic error.",0,1,
214,Association between the Academic Medical Center's guidelines on pharmaceutical detailing and the physician's prescription,"Significance To regulate conflicts of interest among physicians, some academic medical centers (AMCs) in the US enacted policies between 2006 and 2012 restricting sales visits by pharmaceutical sales representatives to physicians (so-called detailing). Little is known about the impact of these guidelines on prescribing by physicians. Aim To analyze the relationship between detailed policies enacted in AMCs and physician prescribing of actively detailed and non-detailed drugs. Design, Setting, and Participants The study used multivariable difference-in-differences regression analysis to assess changes in physician prescribing before and after implementation of detailed guidelines at AMCs in 5 states (California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York). to compare. who formed the intervention group with changes in prescription, by a matched control group of similar physicians who are not subject to detailed guideline. Exposures Implementation of Academic Medical Center policies governing visits by pharmaceutical vendors to treating physicians. Key Findings and Measures The monthly market share within drug class of prescriptions written by a single physician for detailed and non-detailed drugs across 8 drug classes (lipid lowering drugs, gastroesophageal reflux disease drugs, diabetes drugs, antihypertensives, licensed hypnotics). treatment of insomnia [sleeping pills], medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, antidepressants and antipsychotics), comparing the 10-36 month period before implementation of the detailed guidelines with the 12-36 month period after implementation, subject to data availability . Results The analysis included 16-121-483 prescriptions issued between January 2006 and June 2012 by 2126 treating physicians of the 19 AMCs in the intervention group and by 24-593 physicians in the corresponding control group. The average market share of the sample at the doctor-drug-month level for detailed and non-detailed drugs prior to the enactment of the guidelines were 19.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Exposure to an AMC detailing guideline was associated with a 1.67 percentage point decrease in detailed drug market share (95% CI, ?2.18 to ?1.18 percentage points""; P?<?.001) and an increase in market share associated by non-detailed drugs of 0.84 percentage points (95% CI, 0.54 to 1.14 percentage points; P?<?.001) Associations were statistically significant for 6 of 8 study drug classes for detailed drugs (lipid-lowering drugs, drugs against gastroesophageal reflux disease)., antihypertensive drugs, sleep aids, drugs for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and antidepressants) and for 9 of the 19 AMCs that implemented policies. Eleven of the 19 AMCs regulated vendor gifts to physicians, restricted vendor access to facilities, and specifically included enforcement mechanisms.In 8 of these 11 AMCs there was a significant change in prescription On the other hand, there was a significant change in only 1 out of 8 AMCs that did not issue policies in all 3 areas. Conclusions and Relevance e Implementation of policies at AMCs that restricted drug detailing between 2006 and 2012 was associated with a modest but significant decrease in the prescribing of detailed drugs in 6 out of 8 major drug classes. However, changes have not been noted in all AMCs that have issued policies.",0,0,

216,Association of a low-frequency variant of HNF1A with type 2 diabetes in a Latino population,"Significance Latino populations have one of the highest prevalences of type 2 diabetes in the world. Objectives To investigate the association between rare protein-coding genetic variants and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a large Latino population and to investigate potential molecular and physiological mechanisms for the observed associations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Whole exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from 3,756 Mexican and US Latinos (1,794 with type 2 diabetes and 1,962 without diabetes) recruited from 1993-2013. One variant was further characterized for allelic frequency and association with type 2 diabetes in large multiethnic datasets of 14-276 participants and in experimental assays. Main outcome and measures Prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Secondary endpoints included age at onset, body mass index and effect on protein function. Results A single rare missense variant (c.1522G>A [p.E508K]) was associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence (odds ratio [OR], 5.48"", 95% CI, 2.83- 10.61;P?=?4.4?Â ¡Ã ?10?7) in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-Ã¦Ã (HNF1A), the gene responsible for adult-onset type 3 diabetes (MODY3). This variant was observed in 0.36% of participants without type 2 diabetes 2.1% of participants with it.In multiracial replication datasets, the p.E508K variant was only found in Latino patients (n?=?1443 with type 2 -diabetes and 1673 without diabetes) and was associated with type 2 diabetes (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.75-9.92; ""P?=?.0013). In experimental assays, HNF- 1A protein encoding the p.E508K mutant had reduced transactivation activity of its target promoter compared to a wild-type protein.In our data, carriers and non-carriers of the p.E508K mutation with type 2 diabetes showed no significant differences the compared clinic characteristics, including age at onset. The mean (SD) age for carriers was 45.3 years (11.2) versus 47.5 years (11.5) for non-carriers (P?=?.49), and the mean (SD) BMI for carriers was 28, 2 (5.5) versus 29.3 (5.3) for carrier noncarriers (P?=?.19). Conclusions and Relevance Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a single low-frequency variant in the MODY3-causing gene HNF1A that is associated with type 2 diabetes in Latino populations and may impair protein function. This finding may have implications for screening and therapeutic modification in this population, but additional studies are needed.",0,0,
217,Association of combatant status and sexual violence with health and psychological outcomes in post-conflict Liberia,"Initial situation The wars in Liberia since 1989 have cost the lives of tens of thousands of people and traumatized many people mentally and physically. Objectives To assess the prevalence and impact of war-related psychosocial trauma, including information on participation in Liberia's civil wars, exposure to sexual violence, social functioning and mental health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based, multi-level, randomized, cross-sectional cluster survey of 1666 adults 18 years and older using structured interviews and questionnaires, conducted in Liberia in May 2008 over a 3-week period. Main outcome measures Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, social functioning, exposure to sexual violence, and health and mental health needs among Liberian adults who have witnessed or participated in the conflicts in the past 2 decades. Results In the Liberian adult household population, 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36%-45%; n=672/1659) met symptom criteria for MDD, 44% (95% CI, 38%-49%; n=718 /1661) met symptom criteria for PTSD and 8% (95% CI, 5%-10%; n=133/1666) met criteria for social dysfunction. 1666) reported having served time in the armed forces, and 33.2% of ex-combatants (182/549) were female. Ex-combatants were more likely to experience sexual violence than non-combatants: among women 42.3% (95% CI, 35.4% -49.1%) vs. 9.2% (95% CI, 6.7% -11.7 %), males 32.6% (95% CI, 27.6% - 37.6%) vs. 7.4% (95% CI, 4.5% - 10.4% ). , 95% CI, 63%-84%) was higher than among those who had not experienced sexual violence (44%; 95% CI, 33%-53%).

218,Association of socioeconomic position with health behavior and mortality,"Context Previous studies may have underestimated the contribution of health behaviors to social inequalities in mortality because health behaviors were only assessed at the start of the study. Aim To investigate the role of health behaviors in the association between socioeconomic position and mortality, and to compare whether their contribution, when assessed at only one point in time, differs from that assessed longitudinally over the follow-up period. Design, setting and participants The Whitehall II UK cohort study, launched in 1985, includes 10,308 civil servants aged 35-55 living in London, England. The analyzes are based on 9,590 men and women followed for mortality through April 30, 2009. Socioeconomic position was derived from civil service grade (high, medium, and low) at baseline. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical activity were assessed 4 times during the follow-up period. Main outcome measures all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. Results A total of 654 participants died during the follow-up period. In analyzes adjusted for sex and year of birth, those in the lowest socioeconomic position had a 1.60 times greater risk of dying from all causes than those in the highest socioeconomic position (a rate difference of 1.94/1000 person-years). This association was attenuated by 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21%-94%) when health behaviors assessed at baseline were entered into the model, and by 72% (95% CI, 42%-154%) when if this was the case, were entered as time-dependent covariates. The corresponding attenuations were 29% (95% CI, 11% - 54%) and 45% (95% CI, 24% - 79%) for cardiovascular mortality and 61% (95% CI, 16% - 425%) and 94% (95% CI, 35%-595%) for non-cancer and non-cardiovascular mortality. The difference between the baseline assessment alone and the repeated health behavior assessments was mainly due to an increased explanatory power of diet (from 7% to 17% for all-cause mortality), physical activity (from 5% to 21% for all causes of death), and alcohol consumption (from 3rd % to 12% for all-cause mortality). The role of smoking, the strongest mediator in these analyses, did not change when baseline or repeated assessments were used (from 32% to 35% for all-cause mortality). Conclusion In a public sector population in London, England, there was an association between socioeconomic position and mortality that was largely explained by adjustment to health behaviors, particularly when behaviors were repeatedly assessed.",0,0,
219,Asthma awareness program in Russia: educating patients,"To counter the recent increase in asthma morbidity and mortality in Russia, an intervention study was conducted to improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of asthma. The US recommendations for asthma management have been adapted to educate Moscow families with children with asthma. Two hundred and fifty-two children with asthma, aged 4 to 14 years, who were being treated with their parents at eight Moscow public health clinics, were enrolled in the study to see whether US textbooks on asthma management in Russia are acceptable and effective would be. Children in four of the clinics with recent asthma attacks were randomly assigned to either the education or control groups to test whether patient education and guided asthma management would improve patient outcomes. Modern drugs were made available to both groups to see if training in US guidelines was necessary to get physicians to use the drugs. Children with recent asthma attacks in the other four clinics were defined as comparison group 1 to control for the possible effect of drug availability. All of the children in the eight clinics who did not have asthma attacks made up comparison group 2 to see if the outcomes for these children would change over time. One-year follow-up results showed a significant improvement in children's and parents' asthma self-management skills in relation to asthma treatment only in the education group. Significant increases were observed in the subgroup of children in the education group who were taking anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma control. Children in the education group had significantly increased peak flow rates and reduced diurnal peak flow variability compared to control and comparison groups. There was a significantly greater reduction in doctor visits by the educational group of children compared to the control group. Presumably, behavioral changes by parents and children related to asthma treatment and prevention skills, proper management of the disease, and access to medication could be responsible for reducing asthma morbidity in children.",0,0,
220,Attitudes towards reproduction in Latin America. Lessons from the application of modern reproductive technologies,"The use of modern reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization and related procedures, has opened up new areas of legal, religious, and public interest. 30 years ago, the development of effective methods to control reproduction sparked debate about whether couples have the right to enjoy sex without its reproductive effects. Today, assisted reproductive technology (ART) enables couples to have their own children without direct sex intermediation. The Catholic Church has responded against both contraception and ART, and specific directives have been issued to the public, the medical profession, and legislators. In a recent survey, 88.4% of the population in Latin America say they are Catholic"";"" Thus, bioethical considerations and legal implications regarding reproductive interference are strongly imbued with the moral teachings of Catholicism. In 1996, 83 physicians and scientists participating in the Latin American Assisted Reproduction Network prepared a consensus document on ethical aspects and legal implications of ART. The document contains minimal ethical guidelines that Latin American professionals want to adhere to even without legal regulations. This article examines how the medical profession, legislators, and the public respond to religious influences when confronted with difficult bioethical decisions such as the right to reproduce.",0,0,
221,Audit and feedback as a strategy for implementing guidelines in clinical practice: a model for nurses in acute care,"BACKGROUND: The transfer of research results into practice and changing provider behavior is a challenge, even if the benefits are strong. Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines for supportive care (CPG), consistent integration of these principles into practice has not been achieved. The failure of dissemination strategies has been identified as the main obstacle to successful implementation. A potentially effective approach to facilitating the transfer of research results into practice is through audit and feedback. Audit and Feedback is a summary of vendor performance over time, with or without recommendations for improving the practice. Rationale: Cancer pain is an optimal symptom to study when examining the effect of an audit and feedback intervention. It is a common condition with important implications, established guidelines are available, measurable outcomes are defined and there is room for improvement in current practice. Acute Care Nurses Practitioners (NPs) are often responsible for the monitoring and direct management of symptoms such as pain and are well placed to implement CPG and study the impact of guideline adherence on patient pain outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review of published articles, MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Library computerized databases was conducted to assess the state of the art on auditing and feedback as a strategy for changing professional practice. A behavior change model is proposed for its application in advanced nursing practice. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Recognized in medicine as a valuable intervention to improve the quality of healthcare, audit and feedback is a strategy that has not been extensively studied in nursing. Although cancer pain cannot always be completely eliminated, the majority of patients can effectively manage their pain with appropriate use of available therapies. This article reviews the literature on audit and feedback as a strategy for changing professional practice and presents a model for operationalizing the intervention.",0,1,
222,Audit and Feedback: Implications for Professional Practice and Healthcare Outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Audit and feedback continue to be widely used as a strategy to improve professional practice. It seems logical that health professionals would be asked to change their practice if they received feedback that their clinical practice was inconsistent with that of their peers or accepted guidelines. However, audit and feedback have not been consistently effective. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of audit and feedback on healthcare professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the registry and pending files of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group up to January 2004. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized audit and feedback studies (defined as any summary of clinical performance over a period of time) that reported objectively measured professional practice in a health setting or health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Quantitative (meta-regression), visual and qualitative analyzes were performed. For each comparison, we calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR), adjusted for baseline compliance where possible, for dichotomous outcomes, and the percentage and percent change relative to the mean of the post-intervention control group, adjusted for baseline performance if possible, for continuous results. We examined the following factors as possible explanations for the variation in the effectiveness of interventions across comparisons: the type of intervention (audit and feedback alone, audit and feedback with educational events, or multifaceted interventions that included audit and feedback), the intensity of the audit and feedback, the complexity of the intended behavior, the seriousness of the outcome, compliance with baseline values, and the quality of the study. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty new studies were added to this update and a total of 118 studies were included. The primary analysis included 88 comparisons from 72 studies that compared any intervention that includes audit and feedback to no intervention. For dichotomous endpoints, the adjusted risk difference of compliance with desired practice varied from -0.16 (a 16% absolute decrease in compliance) to 0.70 (a 70% increase in compliance) (median = 0.05, interquartile range = 0.03 to 0.11) and the adjusted risk ratio varied from 0.71 to 18.3 (median = 1.08, interquartile range = 0.99 to 1.30). For continuous endpoints, the adjusted percent change relative to control varied from -0.10 (a 10% absolute decrease in compliance) to 0.68 (a 68% increase in compliance) (median = 0.16, interquartile range = 0.05 to 0.37). Low baseline compliance with recommended practice and higher audit and feedback intensity were associated with larger adjusted risk ratios (greater efficacy) across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Audit and feedback can help to improve professional practice. When effective, effects are generally minor to moderate. The relative effectiveness of audit and feedback is likely to be greater when adherence to recommended practices is low initially and when feedback is more intense.",0,1,
223,Audit of a tuberculosis contact tracing clinic,"OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis contact tracing in South Glamorgan 1987-9. DESIGN Review of contact tracing clinic records and Mycobacterium Reference Unit data. The clinic's practice was compared to the 1983 recommendations of the British Thoracic Society. DISCONTINUATION Health Department Tuberculosis Control Program. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of contacts reviewed, follow-up attendance rates, number of secondary cases detected, and quality of records. RESULTS 101 index patients and 611 contacts were identified. 596 (97.5%) contacts were screened, of which 139 should not have been screened. Of 356 contacts who required a Heaf test, 237 were tested, seven declined the test, and 112 had a chest X-ray without a Heaf test. 95 contacts were tested unnecessarily. Chest X-rays were taken unnecessarily in 87 contacts, and X-rays should have been taken in seven people but were not. 34 contacts received inappropriate follow-up appointments and seven were missed during follow-up. Tuberculosis was diagnosed in five asymptomatic contacts, all at initial screening and in all close contacts of index patients with lung disease. CONCLUSION Inadequate data, non-adherence to contact tracing guidelines, and lack of definition of the term “highly contagious index case” resulted in many contacts being unnecessarily screened or traced. IMPACT The efficiency of contact tracing would be improved by reporting swab results and index case ethnicity on the reporting form, clearly categorizing contacts as close or causal, and clearly defining the term highly contagious.",0,0,
224,Australian and New Zealand Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Depression,"BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) coordinates the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Department of Health. METHOD: The CPG team reviewed the outcomes literature, consulted physicians and patients, and performed meta-analyses of outcome research. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: Establish an effective therapeutic relationship; provide the patient with information about the condition, the reasons for treatment, the likelihood of a positive reaction and the expected time frame; consider the patient's strengths, life stresses, and supports. The choice of treatment depends on the skill of the physician and the circumstances and preferences of the patient and should be guided by, but not dictate, these guidelines. For moderate depression, all recognized antidepressant drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are equally effective;"" Clinicians should consider both the treatment burden and benefits, including side effects and toxicity. For major depression, antidepressant treatment should be preceded by psychotherapy precede it. For depression with psychosis, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or a tricyclic in combination with an antipsychotic are equally helpful. Treatments for other subtypes are discussed. Caution should be exercised in individuals taking other medications or with medical conditions. If responding to any Adequate study with first-line treatment is poor, another evidence-based treatment should be used Second opinions are useful Depression has a high rate of recurrence and efforts to reduce it are critical interpretation",0,0,
225,Author Conflict of Interest Disclosures in Vascular Surgery Journals,"OBJECTIVES: Advances in vascular surgery are increasingly technology-driven, and relationships between surgeons and the medical device industry can be complex. This study reviewed conflicts of interest (COI) disclosures in the vascular surgery journals in relation to several selected technology-driven topics including endovascular stent grafts (EV), carotid stenting (CAS) and peripheral arterial interventions (PI) to suggest further directions. METHODS: The authors' COI disclosures were reviewed from all clinical articles published in 2008 and 2009 in each of the six vascular surgery journals relating to three selected topics (EV, CAS, and PI). The rate of COI disclosure was assessed as a function of journal, subject, article type (randomized trial, case series, case report, review, or meta-analysis), and authors' region of origin. Second, the consistency of authors' disclosures was assessed by reviewing articles by the same author and topic. RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-five articles from the six journals were reviewed. A COI was declared for 125 (19.7%) of these papers. This rate differed between journals (range: 3.2%–34.1%; P<0.0001). The disclosure rate did not differ between topics (range: 12.8%-21.2%; P=0.12), article type (range: 14.7%-30%; P=0.28), or region of origin (range: 0% - 33.3%; ""P=0.09). There were 116 cases in which the same author wrote articles describing the same general topic. COI disclosure was consistent in most of these cases (72.4% ), but inconsistent in 32 cases (27.6%) The most common (P = 0.006) inconsistencies concerned the same article type in different journals (46.9%) or in the same journal (25%).CONCLUSIONS: Disclosure rates of COI and inconsistencies in disclosures in the vascular surgery literature are at least partly due to differences in journal reporting guidelines, while a smaller proportion of these discrepancies are due to the behavior of individual authors Journals should adopt a consistent requirement for a separate COI statement in which all relevant financial arrangements are disclosed.",0,0,

227,Automated auditing of hand hygiene with and without intervention,"BACKGROUND: Daily feedback from continuous automated audits with a peer reminder intervention has been used to improve compliance. Compliance rates from covert and overt automated audit phases with and without intervention were compared to mandatory human audits. METHODS: An automated system was installed to covertly detect hand hygiene events with each press of the alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispenser for 5 months. The open phase included key clinicians who were trained to share daily rates with clinicians, set compliance goals, and encourage each other to comply for 6 months. The intervention was continued for another 6 months without any refresher. Quarterly Human Audits were conducted during the procedure by Hand Hygiene Australia (HHA) in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Percentage point (PP) differences between compliance rates were used to determine change. RESULTS: The HHA rates for June 2014 were 85% and 87% on the medical and surgical wards, respectively. These rates were 55 PPs and 38 PPs higher than the June 2014 covert automation rates for the medical and surgical wards of 30% and 49%, respectively. During the intervention phase, mean compliance at the medical ward did not change from its covert rate, while the surgical ward improved by 11 PPs to 60% compared to the covert phase. On average, compliance did not change during the procedure without a refresher on the medical ward, while the mean rate on the surgical ward decreased by 9 PP. CONCLUSIONS: Automation provided a unique opportunity to respond to daily rates, but compliance will return to pre-intervention levels once active intervention ceases or human investigators leave the ward unless clinicians commit to a change.",1,1,
228,Automated identification of postoperative complications within an electronic medical record using natural language processing,"Context Currently, most automated methods for identifying patient safety incidents rely on administrative data codes"";"" However, free text searches in electronic patient files could represent an additional monitoring approach. Objective To evaluate a natural language processing search method for identifying postoperative surgical complications in a comprehensive electronic medical record. Design, Setting, and Patients Cross-sectional study of 2,974 patients who underwent inpatient surgical procedures at 6 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical centers from 1999 to 2006, sepsis, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction, identified through medical record review under the VA program for improvement in surgical quality were identified. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the natural language processing approach to identify these complications and compared its performance to patient safety indicators using discharge coding information. Results The proportion of postoperative events per sample was 2% (39 of 1924) for acute renal failure requiring dialysis, 0.7% (18 of 2327) for pulmonary embolism, 1% (29 of 2327) for deep vein thrombosis, 7% (61 of 866) for sepsis, 16% (222 of 1405) for pneumonia and 2% (35 of 1822) for myocardial infarction. Natural language processing correctly identified 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67%-91%) of acute renal failure cases compared to 38% (95% CI, 25%-54%) for patient safety indicators. Similar results were obtained for venous thromboembolism (59%, 95% CI, 44%-72% vs. 46%, 95% CI, 32%-60%), pneumonia (64%, 95% CI, 58%-70% vs 5%, 95% CI, 3%-9%), sepsis (89%, 95% CI, 78%-94% vs. 34%, 95% CI, 24%-47%) and postoperative myocardial infarction (91%, 95% CI, 78% - 97%) vs. 89%, 95% CI, 74% - 96%). Both natural language processing and patient safety indicators were highly specific to these diagnoses. Conclusion In patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures in VA hospitals, processing natural language analysis of electronic medical records to identify postoperative complications had higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared to patient safety indicators based on discharge coding.",0,0,
229,Availability and prescribing practices of anti-malarial drugs in the private health sector in Yemen,"INTRODUCTION: Although the Yemeni government changed the national malaria treatment policy in November 2005 from chloroquine to artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combinations as first-line treatment and lumefantrine + artemether as second-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, physicians in public and private health facilities continued to prescribe chloroquine because of little knowledge of the new treatment policy. METHODOLOGY: A non-randomized study to pre- and post-evaluate the training and reporting interventions on prescribing behavior and availability of antimalarial drugs among clinicians and pharmacists in the private sector in three governorates in Yemen was conducted. RESULTS: Adherence to the new national guidelines for antimalarial drugs by private sector clinicians improved from 21% pre-intervention to 38% post-intervention, as artesunate + SP was prescribed as first-line treatment. Prescribing of lumefantrine + artemether as second-line antimalarial treatment also improved from 18% pre-procedure to 22% post-procedure. Unfortunately, the combination of halofantrine + SP continued to be widely prescribed by physicians in the city of Sana'a (18%). Artesunate + SP and quinine significantly increased their commercialization from 8% pre-intervention to 22% post-intervention (P-value 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence for the usefulness of the educational intervention on national guidelines for malaria treatment. In addition, involving private health care providers in reporting processes will promote prudent prescribing and availability of antimalarial drugs.",0,0,
230,Available screening tools for adults suffering from bipolar affective disorder in primary care: An integrative literature review,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of six tools used in primary care for screening for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). BPAD has a history of being underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, followed by inappropriate treatment, leading to detrimental flare-ups, suicide, and an increased risk of comorbidities. DATA SOURCES: An electronic search was performed to identify articles in the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, National Guideline Clearinghouse, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and PsycARTICLES. Additional information was also gathered from the NIH, CDC, Healthy People 2020, the Black Dog Institute, and the Center for Quality Assessment and Improvement for Mental Health. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that primary care physicians are often the first and sometimes only providers, underscoring the importance of early detection and screening of BPAD in primary care. By implementing appropriate screening tools and adhering to recommended treatment and intervention guidelines, relapse prevention is increased and comorbidities are diagnosed more frequently, resulting in an overall improved quality of life. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Primary care physicians play an important role in adequate screening for BPAD and implementation of recommended treatments to increase relapse prevention and promote a healthier and more socially successful quality of life.",0,0,
231,Barriers and enablers to implementing guideline recommendations for multiple stroke: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Putting evidence into practice is an important final step in the evidence-based practice process. Medical record audits can be used to examine how well the practice compares to published evidence and to identify gaps between evidence and practice. After providing audit feedback to professionals, local barriers to practice change can be identified and addressed with targeted behavior change interventions. This study aimed to identify barriers and prerequisites for the implementation of multiple stroke policy recommendations in an Australian stroke unit. METHODS: A qualitative methodology was used. A sample of 28 health, nursing and medical professionals participated in a group or individual interview. These interviews took place after employees received audit feedback and identified areas for practice change. Questions focused on barriers and requirements for implementing the guideline recommendations for managing: upper extremity sensory impairments, mobility including balance while sitting, vision, anxiety and depression, neglect, swallowing, communication, education for stroke survivors and caregivers, Advice on returning to work and driving.Qualitative data were analyzed for subjects using theoretical domains described by Michie and colleagues (2005).RESULTS: Six group and two individual interviews were conducted, spanning six disciplines Barriers varied between disciplines.The six main barriers identified were: (1) Beliefs about the abilities of individual professionals and their discipline, and about the abilities of patients (2) Beliefs about the positive and negative consequences of implementing the recommendations (3) Recalling and observing best practices (4) Knowledge and skills required to implement best practice;"" (5) intent and motivation to implement best practices; and (6) resources. Some barriers also paved the way for change. For example, occupational therapists needed new knowledge and skills (a barrier) to better manage sensitivity and neglect impairments, while physical therapists generally knew how to implement best practice mobility rehabilitation (an enabler). CONCLUSIONS: The results complement current knowledge about barriers to change and implementation of several guideline recommendations. The biggest challenges included sex education and depression screening. Limited knowledge and skills were a common obstacle. Knowledge of specific interventions was required before implementation could begin and to maintain treatment accuracy. Providing detailed online intervention protocols and manuals can help physicians overcome the knowledge barrier.",0,0,
232,Barriers and facilitations associated with nonsurgical management of osteoarthritis patients in orthopedic practice,"INTRODUCTION: International evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) recommend starting with (a combination of) non-surgical treatments and resorting to surgery only when a patient is not responding adequately to non-surgical treatment addresses treatment options. Despite these recommendations, there is strong evidence that nonsurgical treatments are not optimally used in orthopedic practice. Improving the uptake of non-surgical treatments requires more insight into the barriers and enablers of these treatments. Therefore, this study investigated the barriers and facilitations associated with the use and prescription of various non-surgical treatments for osteoarthritis of the hip and knee in orthopedic practice among patients and orthopedic surgeons in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted two internet-based surveys among 172 orthopedic surgeons and 174 OA patients. Univariate association and multivariable regression techniques are used to identify barriers and promoters associated with the use of nonsurgical treatments. RESULTS: Most of the barriers and relief experienced by patients were associated with the use of physical therapy, lifestyle counseling, and nutritional therapy. Among orthopedic surgeons, most were associated with the prescription of acetaminophen, diet therapy, and physical therapy. Examples of barriers and supporters among patients included “People around me have had positive experiences with surgery” (moderator for osteoarthritis education) and “Advice from people around me to keep moving” (moderator for lifestyle and nutrition advice ). Examples of orthopedists were “Lack of guideline knowledge” (barrier to lifestyle advice), “Agreements/consultation with GP” and “Easy communication with a nutritionist” (facilitator for nutritional therapy). Belief in the effectiveness of these treatments was also associated with increased prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to improve the use of nonsurgical treatments in orthopedic practice should aim to change orthopedic surgeon beliefs, communicate with other OA care providers, and involve the patient's environment in OA treatment.",0,0,
233,Obstacles and facilitators to the implementation of VA household basic services on Indian reservations: a multi-case qualitative study,"Background Veterans Health Affairs (VA) home primary care (HBPC) is an evidence-based interdisciplinary approach to non-institutional long-term care developed in urban settings to provide long-term care to vulnerable elderly patients. Under the authority of a memorandum of understanding between the VA and Indian Health Service (IHS) to improve access to healthcare, 14 VA Medical Centers (VAMC) have independently initiated plans to expand HBPC programs to rural Indian reservations, and 12 VAMC have successful programs implemented. The purpose of this study is to describe barriers and facilitators to implementation in rural indigenous communities, with the goal of informing planners and policymakers for future program expansions. Methods A qualitative comparative case study approach was used, with each of the 14 VAMC treated as a case. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as the basis for an open-ended interview guide, telephone interviews (n = 37) were conducted with HBPC staff and clinicians and local/regional managers who participated in or oversaw the implementation. The interviews were transcribed, coded, and then analyzed using CFIR domains and constructs to describe and compare experiences and to identify facilitators, barriers, and adaptations that were common across VAMC and HBPC programs. Findings Within the VAMC, there were significant differences in local contexts. Nonetheless, implementation was typically facilitated by key individuals who were able to build trust in VA healthcare in Native American communities. The guidelines encouraged clinical collaboration, but collaborations generally occurred on an ad hoc basis between VA and IHS clinicians to optimize patient resources. All programs required some adjustments to remove barriers in rural areas, such as B. distances, caseloads, or delays in hiring additional clinicians. VA funding opportunities facilitated the expansion and maintenance of these programs. Conclusions Since program expansion is the responsibility of the HBPC program director, there is little exchange of experience between the VA institutions. Collaborative learning opportunities would benefit federal health organizations to extend other medical services to additional Native American communities and other rural and underserved communities, as well as coordinate with other health organizations. The CFIR structure was an effective analysis tool to compare programs that address multiple inner and outer settings.",0,0,
234,Obstacles and requirements for evidence-based practice in perinatal care in the SEA-ORCHID project,"Rationale, Aims, and Objectives: The South-East Asia Optimizing Reproductive and Child Health in Developing Countries (SEA-ORCHID) project aimed to improve maternal and infant health outcomes in nine hospitals in Southeast Asia by supporting evidence-based perinatal health care. In this investigation, we aimed to identify and examine the factors that may have acted as barriers or enablers to evidence-based practice change in each of the hospitals. METHODS: During the final 6 months of the intervention phase of the project, semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 179 nurses, midwives, and physicians from the maternal and neonatal departments in each of the nine participating Southeast Asian country hospitals. RESULTS: The interviews identified several factors that participants believed had a significant impact on the effectiveness of the SEA-ORCHID intervention. These included knowledge, skills, hierarchy, multidisciplinarity and leadership, beliefs about consequences, resources, and the nature of behavior. The success of the SEA-ORCHID intervention in improving practice may reflect the extent to which tailored strategies have been effective in overcoming these barriers. CONCLUSION: Effective interventions to align practice with evidence rely on identifying and removing barriers to practice change. The barriers identified in this study may be useful to those designing similar clinical practice improvement projects, as well as ongoing practice improvement efforts at the SEA-ORCHID hospitals.",0,0,
235,Barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening among underserved women in the District of Columbia,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify, from the perspective of medically underserved women in the District of Columbia (DC), barriers to breast and cervical cancer screening services that may influence intent to engage in breast and cervical screening behaviors” to any relationship between determine attitudes and influence of significant others on intended behaviors;' and to identify a relationship between the location where services are provided and underserved women's intentions to engage in screening behaviors. DESIGN: cross section, correlation. SETTING: Breast and cervical cancer screening clinics in DC. SAMPLE: 339 medically underserved adult women. METHODS: Face-to-face investigator-led interviews. KEY RESEARCH VARIABLES: Demographic and contextual variables, as well as attitudes and influence of significant others. Intend to have a monthly mammogram, Pap test, or breast self-examination (BSE). RESULTS: Intention to have a mammogram was positively associated with the influence of important caregivers and negatively associated with indifferent healthcare professionals. The intention to have a Pap test was positively related to one's own attitude towards the test and to the influence of important caregivers. The intention to carry out BSE was positively related to attitudes towards and previous carrying out of BSE and the influence of significant others. No significant relationships were observed between intent to engage in screening behaviors and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Factors influencing women's attitudes toward screening and intent to perform these behaviors include prior screening behaviors, the influence of significant others, and relationships with healthcare professionals. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are well placed to develop and test intervention strategies designed to improve access to and adherence to recommended screening guidelines in medically underserved people. Findings from this study could potentially guide the development and evaluation of such strategies sensitive to this particular population.",0,0,
236,Barriers to the implementation of preconception nursing guidelines as perceived by primary care physicians: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Despite strong evidence for the benefit of preconception interventions in improving pregnancy outcomes, the provision and utilization of preconception care and periconceptional folic acid supplementation remain low. Primary care physicians play a pivotal role in providing preconception care. Understanding primary care physicians' perceptions of the barriers and requirements for implementing preconception care allows for more appropriate targeting of quality improvement interventions. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine the barriers and prerequisites for the provision and uptake of guidelines on preconception care from the perspective of general practitioners, using theoretical areas related to behavior change. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups composed of 22 general practitioners recruited from three regional general practice support organizations. The questions were based on the theoretical domain framework, which describes 12 domains related to behavior change. The GPs' responses were grouped into predefined themes using a deductive process of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Beliefs about abilities, motivations and goals, environmental context and resources, and memory, attention and decision-making were the key domains identified in the barrier analysis. Some of the perceived barriers identified by GPs were time constraints, the lack of women presenting in the preconception phase, the multiple competing preventive priorities within the GP practice, issues related to cost and access to preconception care, and absenteeism of resources to assist in providing care guidelines prior to conception. Perceived enablers identified by GPs included the availability of preconception care checklists and patient brochures, handouts, and waiting room posters that outlined the benefits and availability of preconception care consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified some of the barriers and enablers to the provision and adoption of preconception care guidelines as perceived by general practitioners. The relationship of these barriers to a theoretical domain framework provides a clearer understanding of some of the psychological aspects involved in GP behavior in relation to the provision and use of preconception care. Further research to prioritize these barriers and the theoretical areas to which they relate is needed before a methodologically rigorous intervention can be designed, implemented, and evaluated.",0,0,
237,Barriers to the use of therapies to reduce the risk of breast cancer,"Evidence from randomized clinical trials supports the use of tamoxifen, raloxifene, exemestane, and anastrozole to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, mostly estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Revised clinical guidelines now strongly recommend that physicians offer high-risk drugs to women to reduce their risk of breast cancer. Although only a small proportion of eligible women receive risk-reduction drugs, this suggests a higher uptake in women with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ. Barriers to prescribing risk-reduction drugs include inadequate risk assessment training among physicians, a lack of reimbursement for prevention counseling, and the unavailability of easily accessible and easy-to-use predictive tools for estimating risk-benefit profiles. Strategies to improve acceptance among women have focused on providing breast cancer risk education and information that accurately conveys the risks and benefits of risk-reduction medications. Priority research areas identified to improve the use of risk reduction drugs are (1) the development of risk assessment tools that more accurately identify women most likely to benefit, (2) the identification of circulating or tissue Biomarkers that can predict and monitor treatment responsiveness, and (3) better understanding of patient-related barriers, including patients' subjective beliefs and experiences.",0,0,
238,Baseline depression severity as a moderator of depression outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy: An individual patient data meta-analysis,"IMPORTANT: Current guidelines recommend treating major depression with pharmacotherapy. Both randomized clinical trials and traditional meta-analyses have significant limitations when testing for moderators of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic literature review, collect primary data from studies, and analyze depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant drugs (ADM). DATA SOURCES: A total of 14902 abstracts were examined from a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials from 1966 to 1 January 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials comparing CBT and ADM in patients with a DSM-defined major depressive disorder were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study authors were asked to provide primary data from their study. Primary data from 16 of 24 identified studies (67%) involving 1700 outpatients (794 from the CBT condition and 906 from the ADM condition) were included. Missing data were imputed using several imputation methods. Mixed-effects models adjusted for study-level differences were used to examine baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at seventeen points (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: There was a major effect of ADM versus CBT on HAM-D (beta = -0.88""; P = 0.03) and a non-significant trend on BDI (beta = -1.14; P = 0, 08, statistical trend test).), but no significant differences in response (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; P=0.12) or remission (OR, 1.18; P=0.22). No modest reduction in depressive symptoms between CBT and ADM in outcome (beta = 0.00; P = 0.96).Similar results were observed using the BDI.Severity of depression at baseline also did not moderate the likelihood of response (OR, 0.99 ; P = 0.96).77) or remission (OR, 1.00; ""P = 0.93) between CBT and ADM. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline depression severity did not moderate differences between CBT and ADM on the HAM-D or BDI or in response or remission. This finding cannot be extrapolated to other psychotherapies, individual ADMs, or inpatients. However, it offers new and substantive evidence relevant to researchers, physicians and therapists, and patients.",0,0,
239,Baseline feature of a randomized trial evaluating the impact of disease management programs on prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive and long-term patient education programs to improve self-management can help patients better manage their condition. Using disease management programs (DMPs) prepared for each of the risk factors according to clinical practice guidelines, we assess their impact on stroke prevention. METHODS: This is a randomized study conducted in patients with ischemic stroke within 1 year of its onset. Subjects in the intervention group received a 6-month DMP, which included training in self-management by a nurse and support in collaboration with the GP. Those in the usual care group received usual outpatient care. The primary endpoints are stroke recurrence and stroke death. Patients were enrolled for 2 years, with plans for a 2-year follow-up after the 6-month training period (total 30 months). RESULTS: A total of 321 eligible subjects (mean age 67.3 years; 96 women [29.9%]), including 21 subjects (6.5%) with transient ischemic attack, were enrolled in this study. Regarding risk factors for stroke, 260 patients (81.0%) had hypertension, 249 patients (77.6%) had dyslipidemia, 102 patients (31.8%) had diabetes mellitus, 47 patients (14.6%) had atrial fibrillation and 98 patients (30.5%) ) had chronic kidney disease. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of subject characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes the rationale, design, and basic characteristics of a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effect of DMPs for the secondary prevention of stroke. Subject follow-up is ongoing and will end in 2015.",0,0,

241,Behavior change without communication for behavior change: nudging handwashing among elementary school students in Bangladesh.,"Communicating behavior change to improve handwashing with soap can be labor and resource intensive, but high-quality results are difficult to achieve. Nudges are environmental stimuli that trigger unconscious decision-making processes to stimulate behavioral change. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed an inexpensive set of nudges to encourage handwashing with soap after using the toilet in two primary schools in rural Bangladesh. We conducted direct observation of behavior at baseline, after deployment of traditional handwashing infrastructure, and at multiple time periods after targeted handwashing nudges (1 day, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks). No additional hand washing training or motivational messages were given. Handwashing with soap among schoolchildren was low at baseline (4%) and increased to 68% the day after the nudges were completed and to 74% at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the intervention. Findings indicate that nudge-based interventions have the potential to improve handwashing with soap among schoolchildren in Bangladesh, and specific areas for further investigation are discussed.",0,1,
242,Behavior counseling after primary care alcohol abuse screening: A systematic review and meta-analysis for the United States Prevention Services Task Force,"Background: Alcohol abuse, which spans the spectrum from hazardous drinking to alcohol dependence, is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Purpose: To evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescents and adults who abuse alcohol. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and reference lists of published literature (January 1985 to January 2012, restricted to English language articles). Study selection: Controlled studies of at least 6 months duration enrolling alcohol abusers identified through primary care screening and evaluating behavioral counseling interventions. Data Extraction: One reviewer extracted data and a second verified accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned quality scores and assessed the strength of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 23 included studies generally excluded people with alcohol dependence. The best evidence was for short (10 to 15 minutes) multi-contact interventions. Adults receiving behavioral interventions reduced consumption by 3.6 drinks/week from baseline (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/week [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8 drinks/week],” 10 studies; 4332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported heavy drinking episodes (risk difference 0.12 [CI 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 studies; 2737 participants), and 11% more adults reported less than recommended limits to drink (risk difference 0.11 [CI 0.08 to 0.13]; 9 studies). ;"" 5973 participants) over 12 months compared to controls (moderate weight of evidence). There was insufficient evidence to conclude on accidents, injuries or alcohol-related liver problems.

243,Behavioral Counseling Interventions to Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections: Statement of Recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,"DESCRIPTION: New US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for behavioral counseling for adolescents and adults to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of counseling. The review included studies evaluating behavioral counseling interventions delivered in primary care, those deemed feasible in primary care, and those to which patients might be referred from primary care. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends high-intensity behavioral counseling for all sexually active youth and adults at increased risk for STIs. (B recommendation) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefit-harm balance of behavioral counseling to prevent sexually transmitted infections in non-sexually active adolescents and adults without an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

244,Behavioral counseling to promote physical activity and a healthy diet to prevent cardiovascular disease in adults: A systematic review for the U.S. Prevention Services Task Force,"Background: Poor diet and lack of exercise can worsen cardiovascular health, yet most Americans do not follow recommendations on diet and physical activity advice to prevent cardiovascular disease. Data sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2001 to January 2010), experts and existing systematic reviews used a priori inclusion criteria and critically assessed each study using design-specific quality criteria. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for several intermediate health and behavioral outcomes. however, other direct evidence of a reduction in disease morbidity is lacking. High-intensity nutritional counseling, with or without exercise counseling, resulted in changes in body mass index (obesity) of 0.3 to 0.7 kg/m2, 1.5 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.1 mm Hg) in systolic blood pressure, ?0.7 mm Hg (CI, ?0.6 to ?0.9 mm Hg) in diastolic pressure, ?0.17 mmol/L (CI, ?0.09 to ?0.25 mmol/L) (?6.56 mg/dL [CI, 3.47 to 9.65 mg/dL]) total cholesterol level and 0.13 mmol/L (CI, 0.06 to 0.21 mmol/L) ( 5.02 mg/dL [CI, 2.32 to 8.11 mg/dL ]) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Moderate- and high-intensity counseling resulted in moderate-to-large changes in self-reported diet and exercise behaviors. Limitations: Meta-analyses for some outcomes showed high statistical heterogeneity or evidence of publication bias. Only 11 studies followed results beyond 12 months. Conclusion: Counseling to improve diet or increase physical activity altered health behaviors and was associated with modest improvements in obesity, blood pressure, and lipid levels.

246,Behavioral programs for type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis,"Background: Behavioral programs can improve outcomes for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but there is a wide variety of behavioral interventions and uncertainty about how to optimize the effectiveness of these programs. Purpose: To identify factors that moderate the effectiveness of behavioral programs for adults with type 2 diabetes. Data sources: 6 databases (1993 to January 2015), conference proceedings (2011 to 2014) and reference lists. Study Selection: Duplicate screening and selection of 132 randomized controlled trials evaluating behavioral programs versus usual treatments, active controls, or other behavioral programs. Data Extraction: One reviewer extracted and another verified data. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias. Data Synthesis: Behavioral programs were grouped based on program content and delivery methods. A Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that most lifestyle and diabetes self-management education and support programs (typically offering 11 contact hours) resulted in clinically important improvements in glycemic control (0.4% reduction in hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ). ), while most diabetes self-management education programs without additional support, especially those offering 10 or fewer contact hours, have yielded little benefit. Programs with higher effect sizes were more often delivered in person than via technology. Lifestyle programs led to the largest reductions in body mass index. Reductions in HbA1c appeared to be greater in participants with a baseline HbA1c of 7.0% or greater, in adults younger than 65 years of age, and in minority groups (subgroups with 75% nonwhite participants). Limitations: All studies had an intermediate or high risk of bias. Subgroup analyzes were indirect and therefore exploratory. Most outcomes were reported immediately after the interventions. Conclusion: Diabetes self-management training that provided 10 or fewer hours of contact with delivery staff was of little benefit. Behavioral programs appear to benefit those with suboptimal or poor glycemic control more than those with good control. Primary source of funding: Health Research and Quality Agency.

247,Behavioral Sexual Risk Reduction Counseling in Primary Care for Preventing Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Prevention Services Task Force,"Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common and preventable. Purpose: To update a previous systematic review of the benefits and harms of sexual risk reduction counseling for STD prevention for the US Preventive Services Task Force. Data sources: Selected databases from January 2007 to October 2013, manual searches of reference lists and gray literature, and studies from the previous review. Study selection: English-language studies of fair or good quality conducted on adolescents or adults. Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data and a second reviewed the abstraction. The quality of the study was checked twice. Data synthesis: 31 studies were included: 16 (n=56,110) were newly published and 15 (n=14,214) were from the previous review. Most studies have targeted people at increased risk for STIs based on sociodemographic characteristics, risky sexual behavior, or history of an STI. High-intensity (>2 hours) interventions reduced STI incidence in adolescents (odds ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.60]) and adults (odds ratio, 0.70 [CI, 0 .56 to 0.87]). Lower-intensity interventions have generally not been effective in adults, but some approaches have shown promise. Although moderate-intensity interventions can be effective in adolescents, data have been very sparse. Reported behavioral outcomes were heterogeneous, most likely demonstrating benefit with high-intensity interventions at 6 months or less. No consistent evidence was found that sexual risk reduction counseling was harmful. Limitations: Low-risk populations and adolescent males were underrepresented. The reliability of the self-reported behavioral outcomes was unknown. Conclusion: Intensive sexual risk reduction counseling can reduce sexually transmitted infections in primary care and allied settings, particularly among sexually active adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

248,Behavioral therapy with or without biofeedback and electrical pelvic floor stimulation for persistent postprostatectomy incontinence,"Context Although behavioral therapy has been shown to improve postoperative continence recovery, there have been no controlled studies of behavioral therapy for incontinence after prostatectomy lasting longer than 1 year. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral therapy in reducing persistent postprostatectomy incontinence and to determine whether biofeedback and pelvic electrical stimulation technologies improve the effectiveness of behavioral therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, randomized, controlled study of 208 community-dwelling men, ages 51 to 84, with persistent incontinence 1 to 17 years after radical prostatectomy was conducted at a university and 2 Veterans Affairs continence clinics (2003-2008). performed and included a 1-year follow-up after active treatment. 24% of the men were African American, 75% white. Interventions After stratification by type and frequency of incontinence, participants were randomized to one of 3 groups: 8 weeks of behavioral therapy (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies), behavioral therapy plus dual-channel electromyograph biofeedback in the office, and daily electrical pelvic floor stimulation at home at 20 Hz, current up to 100 mA (behaviour plus) or delayed treatment, which served as a control group Reduction in mean number of incontinence episodes after 8 weeks of treatment, documented in 7-day bladder diaries. ) after behavioral therapy and from 26 to 12 (51% reduction; 95% CI, 37%-65%) after behavior plus therapy. Both reductions were significantly greater than the reduction from 25 to 21 (24% reduction; 95% CI, 10%-39%) observed among controls (P=0.001 for both treatment groups). However, there was no significant difference in the reduction in incontinence between the treatment groups (p=0.69). Improvements lasted up to 12 months in the active treatment groups: 50% reduction (95% CI, 39.8%-61.1%; 13.5 episodes per week) in the behavioral group and 59% reduction (95% CI, 45.0% - 73.1%; "" 9.1 episodes per week) in the behavior plus group (p = 0.32). Conclusions In patients with postprostatectomy incontinence for at least 1 year, 8 weeks of behavioral therapy resulted reduced episodes of incontinence compared to a delayed treatment control group.The addition of biofeedback and electrical pelvic floor stimulation did not result in greater efficacy.",0,0,
249,Behavioral therapy of obesity in primary care patients: a systematic review,"IMPORTANT: In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approved intensive behavioral weight loss counseling for approximately 14 in-person, 10- to 15-minute sessions over 6 months for obese primary care beneficiaries when delivered by physicians and others CMS-defined general practitioners. AIM: To conduct a systematic review of behavioral counseling for overweight and obese patients recruited from primary care, as provided by primary care physicians, alone or with trained interventionists (e.g., medical assistants, registered dietitians) or by trained interventionists, who work independently, work. REVIEW OF EVIDENCE: We searched PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and June 2014 that recruited overweight and obese patients from primary care and received behavioral counseling (i.e. diet, exercise and behavioral therapy) for at least 3 months, with at least 6 months of follow-up after randomisation; included at least 15 participants per treatment group and objectively measured weights;” and had a comparison test, an intention-to-treat analysis, and a turnover of less than 30% at 1 year or less than 40% at longer follow-up. RESULTS: Review of 3304 abstracts identified 12 studies with 3893 participants that met inclusion/exclusion criteria and specified quality assessments. No studies were found in which general practitioners provided consultations according to the CMS guidelines. Mean 6-month weight changes from baseline in the intervention groups ranged from a loss of 0.3 kg to 6.6 kg. In the control group, the mean change ranged from an increase of 0.9 kg to a decrease of 2.0 kg. Weight loss in both groups generally decreased with longer follow-up (12-24 months). Interventions that prescribed both reduced energy intake (e.g., >/= 500 kcal/day) and increased physical activity (e.g., >/= 150 minutes of walking per week) with traditional behavioral therapy generally resulted in a greater weight loss than interventions without all 3 specific components. In the previous studies, more treatment sessions, delivered in person or over the phone by trained interventionists, were associated with greater mean weight loss and patients were more likely to lose 5% or more of their baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Intensive behavioral counseling can induce clinically meaningful weight loss, but there is little research on primary care physicians providing such care. The present results suggest that a range of trained interventionists, counseling in person or by telephone, could be considered for the management of overweight or obesity in patients encountered in primary care.",0,0,
250,Behavior change strategies to reduce the blood pressure-related burden of disease: Findings from a global implementation research program,"BACKGROUND: The Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases comprises the majority of the world's public research funding organizations. It focuses on implementation research to address the burden of chronic disease in low- and middle-income countries and among vulnerable populations in high-income countries. Its first research call funded 15 projects focused on reducing the burden of disease related to blood pressure. In this study, we describe a reflexive mapping exercise to identify the behavior change strategies implemented in each of these projects. METHODS: Using the behavior change wheel, each team assessed the ability, opportunity, and motivation of the different actors who were integral to each project (e.g., community members, non-physician health workers, and physicians in projects focused on service delivery). The teams then mapped the interventions they implemented and identified the major policy categories in which those interventions were implemented. Provided guidance on using the behavior change wheel to help ensure consistency of responses across teams. Ratings were iteratively discussed and refined in several group sessions. RESULTS: There were marked differences in the perceived skills, opportunities, and motivations of the different actors targeted for behavior change strategies. Despite this variation, there was a high degree of synergy in the intervention functions, with most teams employing complex interventions involving education, training, empowerment, environmental restructuring, and persuasion strategies. Similar policy categories were also targeted across teams, particularly in the areas of policy, communication/marketing and service delivery, with some teams focusing on fiscal measures, regulation and legislation. CONCLUSIONS: The large differences in the willingness to change behavior among the key actors in these projects suggest that the interventions themselves are received differently, despite the similarity of the approaches used. The results underscore the importance of contextual factors in the success and failure of research programs. Future outcome and process assessments of each project will build on this exploratory work and provide a better understanding of factors that might influence the scale-up of intervention strategies.",0,0,

252,Beliefs and attitudes about breast cancer and screening practices among Arab women living in Qatar: a cross-sectional study,"BACKGROUND: Despite rising breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, breast cancer screening (BCS) rates among women in Qatar remain low. Previous studies point to the need for a better understanding of the many complex beliefs, values, and attitudes that influence the health-oriented behaviors of Arab women in order to develop culturally appropriate and effective breast cancer intervention strategies in the Middle East. This study examines beliefs, attitudes, and BCS practices of Arabic-speaking women in Qatar. Methods: From March 2011 to July 2011, a multi-centre, cross-sectional, quantitative survey was conducted in Qatar among 1,063 (87.5% response rate) Arabic-speaking female Qatari citizens and non-Qatar residents aged 35 years or older. Associations between beliefs and BCS practice were estimated using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Participants who adhered to BCS guidelines (BCS practice = Yes) were compared to those who did not (BCS practice = No). RESULTS: In addition to low awareness and participation rates in BCS, a quarter of the participants said their doctors had discussed breast cancer with them, and less than half of the women surveyed believed breast cancer could be prevented. Women who practiced BCS were more likely to have a doctor talk to them about breast cancer and believe they were in good to excellent health, that cancer could be prevented, or that cancer was hereditary. The majority wanted to know if they had cancer and felt that their medical care needs were met. The main reasons given for not planning BCS were lack of referral, fear and embarrassment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a variety of channels (healthcare providers, media, breast cancer survivors, community leaders) should be leveraged to create culturally appropriate breast cancer intervention programs and to raise awareness about breast cancer, BCS, and the benefits of early breast cancer detection. Deploying these measures will reduce breast cancer mortality rates among Arabic-speaking women living in the state of Qatar.",0,0,
253,Beliefs about mammography screening in women presenting to the emergency department for non-urgent care,"INTRODUCTION: One in 8 women in the US will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. Despite evidence that mammography is an effective method of early detection, certain at-risk groups, such as For example, those using the ED as a medical facility do not follow mammography screening guidelines and experience differential mortality from breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in opinion about mammography screening among women visiting the emergency department for non-urgent care, and ultimately to develop interventions that promote mammography for this at-risk population. METHODS: We examined the relationship between the stage of readiness to introduce mammography behavior and barriers, benefits, and perceived vulnerabilities by issuing risk, benefit, and barrier scales in a sample of 110 women presenting to the emergency department of a public hospital non-urgent complaints or sat in the emergency room waiting room. We also collected socio-demographic information and maturity level. RESULTS: Mammography adherence was approximately 60%. Most of the women who didn't follow current guidelines were thinkers. Those who did not consider getting tested were significantly less likely to consider themselves at risk of developing breast cancer. Women who had greater barriers to mammography felt less benefit from mammography. African-American women felt less benefit from mammography. DISCUSSION: Mammography advertising is appropriately placed in the emergency department waiting room given the suboptimal rate at which this population is being screened. Opinions on mammography differ among women at various stages of mammography introduction and among women from minority groups. Understanding these differences will allow population-specific interventions in this setting. Emergency room nurses are an important, and sometimes the only, point of contact for patients who routinely visit the emergency department. As such, they have a valuable opportunity to deliver promotional messages for cancer prevention. It is critical that caregivers in this setting understand the complexities of providing this information and the need to do so.",0,0,
254,Beneficial and harmful effects of enhanced feedback on physicians' clinical teaching performance,"PURPOSE: To assess whether clinical teaching skills could be improved by providing teachers with enhanced student feedback. METHOD: A 1994 randomized, controlled study involved 42 treating physicians and 39 resident physicians from the Indiana University School of Medicine, who taught 110 students on a one-month rotation basis. Before the lesson rotation, the teachers of the intervention group received norm-related, graphical summaries of their teaching performance as evaluated by the students. At mid-month, teachers in the intervention group received student assessments, supplemented by individualized instructional effectiveness guidelines based on the Stanford Faculty Development Program framework. Linear models were used to analyze mean student ratings of mid-month and month-end instructional behavior. Independent variables included performance ratings, intervention status, teacher status, classroom experience, and interactions with baseline ratings. RESULTS: Complex interactions with output were observed for most instructional categories at mid-month and end-month. The teachers in the intervention group with high baseline performance scores had higher student ratings than the control group teachers with similar baseline scores; the teachers in the intervention group with low baseline performance scores were rated lower than the teachers in the control group with comparable baseline scores. RESIDENTS with moderate or high baselines were rated higher than treating physicians with comparable baselines.” The performance of RESIDENTS with low baselines was similar to that of treating physicians with comparable baselines. CONCLUSION: Baseline performance is important to target those teachers who are most likely to benefit from expanded student feedback. A potential deterioration in teaching performance warrants a re-examination of the distribution of student ratings among low-achieving teachers.",0,0,
255,Benefits and harms of pharmacological treatment of urinary incontinence in women,"Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) in women impairs quality of life. PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic literature review on drugs for urgent UI in women. Data sources: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCIRUS and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 1966 to November 2011. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English. Data extraction: Outcome rates and risk of bias were extracted using a standardized form to summarize the absolute risk differences and calculate the number of attributable events per 1000 patients treated with 95% CIs. Data synthesis: 94 RCTs were eligible. Pooled analyzes showed that among the medications for urgent UI, per 1000 women treated, continence was restored in 130 with fesoterodine (CI 58 to 202), 85 with tolterodine (CI 40 to 129) and 114 with oxybutynin (CI 64 to 163) , 107 with solifenacin (CI, 58 to 156) and 114 with trospium (CI, 83 to 144). Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 31 per 1000 subjects treated with fesoterodine (CI, 10 to 56), 63 with oxybutynin (CI, 12 to 127), 18 with trospium (CI, 4 to 33), and 13 with solifenacin (CI, 1 to 26). The studies' conflicting definitions of reduction in UI and quality of life made evidence synthesis difficult. Limitation: Evidence for improvements in quality of life and comparative drug efficacy was limited, and evidence for the effects of race, severity of UI at baseline, and comorbidities on treatment outcome was insufficient. Conclusion: Overall, medications for urgent UI showed a similarly small benefit. Therapeutic decisions should take into account the damage profile. Evidence of long-term adherence and safety of the treatments is lacking. Primary source of funding: Health Research and Quality Agency.",0,0,
256,"Benzodiazepines, opioids, and driving: a review of experimental research","PROBLEMS: Road traffic accidents are a significant contributor to the overall burden of injuries in Australia, with the risk of injury being linked to the presence of drugs and/or alcohol in the driver's blood. Increasingly, prescription drugs are among the most commonly discovered drugs, with the most notable being benzodiazepines and opioids. However, there is a lack of experimental research on the effects of prescribed psychiatric drugs on driving behavior. APPROACH: This paper reviews experimental studies examining the effects of prescribed doses of benzodiazepines and opioids on driving ability and suggests future research directions. MAIN FINDINGS: There is increasing epidemiological evidence that the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines and opioids is associated with an increased risk of accidents. However, the current experimental literature remains unclear. Limitations in study methods have led to conflicting results. IMPLICATION: There is limited experimental evidence to inform guidelines and guidelines on the fitness to drive of patients taking prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. CONCLUSION: Further experimental research is needed to elucidate the effects of these drugs on driving under different conditions and in different medical contexts. This will ensure that physicians prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids are well informed and can adequately advise patients on the risks associated with driving while taking these drugs.",0,0,

258,Best practice in the management of primary nocturnal enuresis in children: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal wetting is the involuntary nocturnal loss of urine in a child of an age and physical condition when it should be dry. The prevalence of this condition in Australia has been estimated at 18.9% in children aged 5 to 12, with up to 19% of boys and 16% of girls by the age of 5 wetting the bed at least once a month. Up to the age of 13, bedwetting is more common in boys and more common in girls from that age. Nocturnal bed-wetting has a spontaneous cure rate of about 14%, however up to 3% of children remain enuretic as adults. Although this condition is pathologically benign, it can have serious social and psychological effects on the sufferer, including effects on self-esteem, academic success, parental disapproval, and even sexual activity later in life. Despite the amount of information available on the treatment of enuresis, the majority of research has been conducted outside of Australia. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop treatment guidelines for children's night-time wetting that are specific to Australian clinical practice. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered systematic reviews or concurrent controlled trials (randomized controlled trials (RCT), pseudo-randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials (CCT), interrupted time series (ITS), and controlled before-and-after studies (CBA)) on To study the effectiveness of measures to treat night-time wetting in children up to 16 years of age. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all available evidence. Cochrane and other health technology assessment websites were searched for existing systematic reviews. For more recent randomized controlled trials and controlled trials (1990 to 2007), Pubmed, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched. Reference lists of all articles found were searched for relevant studies. These reviews and guidelines have been summarized and presented to an advisory panel of continence advisors and clinicians to ensure relevance to Australian clinical practice. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: The methodological quality of all studies was assessed by two reviewers using the JBI forms for critical evaluation of experimental studies in the JBI-MAStARI software. This tool was used to identify all sources of bias. In the event of differences of opinion between the two experts, a third expert decided. RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews, eight new studies, and two guidelines were used in the development of these guidelines. Brief treatment recommendations include: CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of night-time wetting and the negative psychosocial consequences that can result from this condition, treatment is both readily available and effective. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The practical management of night-wetting in children should begin with treating both daytime-wetting and any signs of constipation. Subsequently, less invasive behavioral therapies should be tried. If these measures fail, the use of alarms with or without a short course of desmopressin can be tried. Other interventions have yet to prove definitively effective and should be viewed with caution. However, it should be emphasized that the vast majority of children will become continent at some point in the future, with or without the benefit of interventions. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: While it is clear that some behavioral methods, alerts, and desmopressin can be effective interventions, the evidence for other treatments is less conclusive. However, the observation that even alarms and/or desmopressin do not work in all children suggests that investigations to determine the effectiveness of other interventions (particularly behavioral and complementary treatments) should take the form of large, carefully designed RCTs.",0,0,
259,Best Strategies for Implementing Clinical Pathways in an Emergency Department: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Cluster Trial,"Background The clinical pathway is a tool that operationalizes the best evidence recommendations and clinical practice guidelines in an accessible format for point-of-care management by multidisciplinary health teams in hospitals. While high-quality, expert-developed clinical pathways have many potential benefits, their impact has been limited by variable implementation strategies and suboptimal research designs. The best strategies for implementing paths in hospital environments are still unknown. The aim of this study is to develop and comprehensively evaluate the best strategies for effective local implementation of externally developed clinical pathways. Design/Methods We will develop a theory-based and knowledge-based intervention strategy to implement two pediatric treatment pathways: asthma and gastroenteritis. Using a balanced incomplete block design, we will randomize 16 community emergency departments to receive the intervention for one clinical pathway and serve as a control for the alternative clinical pathway, and thus conduct two clustered randomized controlled trials to evaluate this implementing intervention. A minimization procedure is used to randomize locations. Intervention centers receive a tailored strategy to support the full implementation of the clinical pathway. We will assess the effectiveness of the implementation strategy by measuring relevant processes and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome of the process is the existence of an appropriately completed clinical pathway on the map for relevant patients. The primary clinical outcomes for each clinical pathway include: Asthma¡Âªthe proportion of asthmatic patients adequately treated with corticosteroids in the ED and at discharge"";"" and Gastroenteritis¡ª the proportion of relevant patients adequately treated with oral rehydration therapy. Data sources include chart audits, administrative databases, environmental scans and qualitative interviews. We also conduct an overall process assessment to assess implementation strategy and an economic analysis to assess implementation costs and benefits. Discussion This study will contribute to the evidence supporting effective strategies for implementing clinical pathways and ultimately reduce the research gaps in practice by operationalizing the best evidence-based nursing recommendations through the effective use of clinical pathways.",0,0,
260,Best practice intervention for the care of clients who are self-mutilating,"PURPOSE: To describe the development of a best practice intervention to guide Nurse Practitioners (NPs) who care for individuals who are self-mutilating. DATA SOURCES: The evidence on which the guideline was based includes six descriptive studies and clinical expert opinions. The framework for guideline development is a systematic process to obtain and analyze the best available evidence, develop a theory-guided intervention, and propose a system for ongoing assessment of the intervention's effectiveness. Conclusions: The guide is an information sheet that includes the definition of self-mutilation, background of the problem, target group concerned and intervention. The three components of the intervention are (a) the NP's self-evaluation of values, beliefs, and assumptions about self-mutilators; (b) a targeted, in-depth assessment of the client; and (c) therapeutic strategies to address the emotional, social, and biological dimensions of self-mutilation. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This best-practice intervention for the care of self-injurious clients provides NPs with guidance on how to effectively address avoidable, self-injurious behavior. Further studies are needed to examine the effectiveness of using the guideline and the intervention.",0,0,
261,Better medicine by default,"Background. The American healthcare system is switching to electronic doctor appointments. These computerized systems are unique in that they allow for custom job interfaces. While these systems offer great benefits, there are also potential pitfalls, as behavioral science has shown that the actual format of electronic interfaces can influence decision-making. In particular, current research examines how errors in electronic prescription templates affect treatment decisions and treatment errors by physicians. methods. 45 residents filled out order kits for 3 medical case studies. Participants were randomly assigned to receive order sets with either ""opt-in"" defaults (options visible but not selected) or ""opt-out"" defaults (options visible and preselected). The results compare error rates between conditions and examine the type and severity of errors most commonly made with opt-in and opt-out defaults. Results. Compared to opt-in defaults, opt-out defaults led to a larger number of items ordered and in particular to increased commission errors (overordering). While opt-in defaults resulted in fewer orders, they also resulted in more omission errors. Taking into account the severity of the errors, the failure effects appear to be limited to less severe errors. Conclusion. The specifications used in electronic prescription records influence medical treatment decisions when the impact on a patient's health is minor. This pattern suggests that physicians cognitively override wrong standard decisions, but only up to a point, and it implies trade-offs that maximize accuracy and minimize cognitive effort. The results indicate that default values for low-impact items on electronic templates require careful attention, as physicians are unlikely to override them.",1,1,
262,Better practices in collaborative mental health care: an analysis of the evidence base,"OBJECTIVES: Conduct a systematic review of the experimental literature to identify better practices in collaborative mental health care in primary care. METHODS: A review of the Canadian and international literature using Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, the Cochrane Library and other databases identified over 900 related reports, of which 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. A systematic review and descriptive analysis is presented with the main conclusions and best practices. RESULTS: A successful collaboration requires preparation, time and supportive structures, building on pre-existing clinical relationships. Collaborative practice is likely to be most developed when clinicians are co-located and most effective when the location is familiar and non-stigmatizing to patients. The degree of collaboration does not appear to predict clinical outcome. Improved collaboration coupled with treatment guidelines or protocols offer important advantages over any intervention alone for major depression. Systematic follow-up was a strong predictor of a positive outcome in cooperative treatment for depression. A clear correlation between collaborative efforts to increase drug intake and clinical outcomes was not apparent. Collaboration alone has not been shown to result in skill transfer in PCP knowledge or behaviors in treating depression. A restructuring of services aimed at supporting changes in the practice patterns of primary health care providers is also required. Improved patient education has been part of many studies with good results. Education was generally provided by someone other than the PCP. Collaborative interventions that are part of a research protocol can be difficult to sustain over the long term without ongoing funding. Consumer choice of treatment modality may be important to treatment in collaborative care (e.g., the ability to choose psychotherapy over medication). CONCLUSIONS: There is now a wealth of experimental literature assessing the impact of improved collaboration on patient outcomes, mainly in depressive disorders. Better practices in collaborative mental health care are beginning to emerge.",0,0,

In addition, the participants were asked to rate the usefulness of various sources of information and to describe the information sources they used according to the aspects of practical knowledge addressed. The respective heads of department were asked about the sources of medical knowledge accessible in their clinic. In almost all hospitals, doctors had access to a library and the Internet. However, the departments differed with regard to their information management (frequency and type of medical training, quality management, participation in research activities). In line with other studies, the most commonly cited sources of knowledge were textbooks, journals, and clinical studies. For most sources, the utility rankings closely matched the user behavior rankings. Both were only weak predictors for inter-physician and guideline compliance. They relate more to the intra-departmental homogeneity of practical knowledge than to cross-departmental and guideline conformity. Homogeneity within the department is enhanced through the use of current, published and evidence-based sources and up-to-date interaction with clinical colleagues. Conformity with the guideline referred to the use of databases and specialist journals. Preference for colleagues from outpatient practices reduced both inter-physician and guideline compliance. It seems that there is still untapped potential for departmental knowledge management, e.g. B. medical education, implementation and use of guidelines and current discussions that can improve the homogeneity and guideline conformance of the practical knowledge that clinicians apply.",0,0,
264,Between control and therapy: An evolutionary concept analysis of special observation in acute psychiatry,"OBJECTIVE: The special observation is a seriously invasive and resource-intensive procedure. For further investigations and practice, it is necessary to conceptualize this measure scientifically. Methods: Evolutionary concept analysis. RESULTS: The identified histories, features and consequences of a particular observation range between control and therapy as well as patient safety and professional coverage. Antecedents include legitimacy (note, evaluation, regulation), resources (internal policies, architectural structures, information), and contextual factors (security needs, personal attitudes). The attitudes identified are organization (qualification, change of caregiver, duration, location), intervention (relationship, reassessment, transparency) and the tension between control and therapy. The consequences consist of side effects (patients, caregivers, resources) and conflicts (ethical dilemmas, role conflicts). CONCLUSION: Society and discipline have influenced the concept over time, and a distinction between the supervisory and control pattern versus a therapeutic approach is recommended.",0,0,
265,Between scientific application and therapy: The ethical consideration,"The development of life sciences and biotechnology over the past thirty years has had a tremendous impact on medicine. New techniques have emerged and new types of treatment have been and are being introduced. Theories about the pathogenesis and causes of disease are changing while new therapeutics are constantly being introduced. The way in which new technologies and medicines are introduced increasingly contains an experimental phase in which animals and humans are used to test the results of the research. These experiments are usually carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, Helsinki 1964, Tokyo, 1975). The guidelines of this declaration deal with the ethical aspects of experiments involving human beings. Although the guidelines are said to have global relevance, the fact remains that some of them are being discussed in several regions of the world. They seem to have a cultural background (e.g. respect for the individual) and life scientists sometimes argue that for this reason they must be considered non-scientific constraints. Based on a general philosophical and ethical view, this paper argues that ethical guidelines are at the core of biomedicine and biology itself. It is in the common interest of researchers, clinicians, patients and scientists to consider the ethical implications of research results before it can be determined that valuable knowledge will be gained. The implementation of monoclonal antibodies in clinical practice can be seen as an example for this reasoning.",0,0,
266,Beyond screening for domestic violence: a systems model approach in a managed care setting,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of domestic violence screening guidelines has been challenging. The multi-faceted “systems model” can provide a powerful tool to improve domestic violence screening, identification and intervention in healthcare settings. METHODS: We developed: (1) a systems model approach using tools for effective referral, assessment, and reporting of domestic violence; (2) materials for distribution to patients; (3) training for social services and mental health clinicians assessing domestic violence; and (4) strong ties to the community INSTITUTION: A nonprofit managed care facility in Richmond, California PARTICIPANTS: Staff and members of the managed care plan by clinicians; (2) increased awareness of the health facility as a resource for domestic violence support;"" and (3) increased member satisfaction with the health plan's efforts to address domestic violence. RESULTS: The number of clinician referrals and patient self-referrals to an evaluator by on-site domestic violence increased by more than two-fold A pre- and post-intervention telephone survey of members seen for routine assessment revealed an increase in member recall of domestic violence issues Post-intervention, statistically significant increases in perceptions of the Members observed the health plan's concern about the health effects of domestic violence (p<0.0001), and member satisfaction with the health plan's efforts to address this issue (p<0.0001). approach improved within lb a year providing domestic violence services in a managed care health setting and influencing the behavior of clinicians and the experience of health plan members.

267,Big pharma and healthcare: unresolvable conflict of interest between private company and public health,"seminal paper on game theory showed that individual profit maximization inevitably compromises the common good, and since the problem has no technical solution, ""it requires a fundamental extension of morality"" (1). We propose here that public health as a public good is now emerging as a severe example of this problem. Recent events and reports increasingly point to a disconnect between the interests of the pharmaceutical industry and those of public health. Johnson & Johnson illegally and effectively promoted Propulsid to children off-label, despite internal company documents raising safety concerns. The drug-trial death was described as a ""trade secret."" Regarding Vioxx, Topol wrote: ""Unfortunately, it is clear that Merck's commercial interest outweighed its concerns about the toxicity of the drug"" (2). Scientists and editors of major journals are increasingly raising concerns about the type and quality of published evidence, which often focuses on the effectiveness of new products. Industry, which funds over 80% of trials, is creating a research agenda that is more driven by marketing than clinical considerations. Intelligent statistical and epidemiological tactics help to achieve the desired results. The budget for marketing is far larger than for research. Massive advertising to doctors and the general public is becoming more sophisticated: ghostwriting, professional guidelines, targeting consumer groups, and manipulating media to spread disease. Pervasive lobbying and political affiliations limit the independence of regulators. Duty to shareholders, which outweighs public health considerations, is not unique to the pharmaceutical industry. The chemical, tobacco and food industries use similar tactics: they proclaim doubts about safety issues, buy researchers, infiltrate universities, boards, media and legislatures. In contrast, high-performing and cheap health-promoting activities that have poor industry support because they are too cheap and unpatented are grossly underutilized: behavior modification technologies (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation), palliative care, and the use of old, more effective, and safer medicines - all could benefit from industry's marketing and quality tools. With the sick, the poor and the least educated being hardest hit, the successes of the free market seem to pose insurmountable challenges to social justice in public health.",0,0,
268,Binge eating disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: The best treatment options for binge eating disorder are unclear. PURPOSE: To summarize evidence on the benefits and harms of psychological and pharmacological therapies for adults with binge eating disorder. DATA SOURCES: English language publications in EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Academic OneFile, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to November 18, 2015 and in MEDLINE up to May 12, 2016. STUDY SELECTION: 9 wait-list-controlled psychological studies and 25 placebo-controlled studies covering pharmacology (n = 19) or combination studies (n = 6) treatment. All were randomized trials with low or moderate risk of bias.DATA EXTRACTION: 2 reviewers independently extracted study data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the strength of evidence.DATA SYNTHESIS: Therapist-led cognitive-behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, and second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) reduced binge -Eating frequency and increased binge eating abstinence (relative risk, 4.95 [95% CI, 3.06 to 8.00], 2.61 [CI, 2.04 to 3.33] and 1, respectively, 67 [CI, 1.24 to 2.26]) . Lisdexamfetamine (mean difference [MD], -6.50 [CI, -8.82 to -4.18]) and SGAs (MD, -3.84 [CI, -6.55 to -1.13]) reduced Binge eating and compulsive eating and SGAs reduced symptoms of depression (MD, -1.97 [CI, -3.67 to -0.28]). Headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, sleep disturbance and sympathetic nervous system excitation were more common with lisdexamfetamine than with placebo (relative risk range 1.63 to 4.28). Other forms of cognitive behavioral therapy and topiramate also increased abstinence and reduced the frequency of binge eating and associated psychopathology. Topiramate reduced weight and increased sympathetic nervous system arousal, and lisdexamfetamine reduced weight and appetite. LIMITATIONS: Most study participants were overweight or obese white women aged 20 to 40 years. Many therapies have only been investigated in individual studies. Outcomes were measured inconsistently across studies and rarely assessed beyond the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behavioral therapy, lisdexamfetamine, SGAs, and topiramate reduced binge eating and associated psychopathology, and lisdexamfetamine and topiramate reduced weight in adults with binge eating disorder.",0,0,
269,Biomedical and Behavioral Research in Nursing Homes: Guidelines for Ethical Inquiry,"As nursing homes become increasingly important sites for biomedical and behavioral research, researchers must address the ethical issues of increased vulnerability and the high prevalence of mental and physical disorders in nursing home populations. Obtaining valid informed consent is just one of the many difficult issues faced by the nursing home investigator. Efforts should be made to involve nursing home residents, as well as family members and staff, in reviewing the research. The benefits and burdens of research protocols should be shared equitably, and potential conflicts of interest for staff and physicians should be minimized or their potential adverse effects mitigated. Adequate attention to these ethical concerns can facilitate research in nursing homes while protecting vulnerable residents. We offer suggested guidelines for conducting research ethically in nursing homes to stimulate discussion among investigators, nursing home staff and residents, residents' families, and ethicists.",0,0,
270,Center for Bipolar Disorder for Pennsylvanians: Conducting an Efficacy Study to Improve Treatment for Patients at Risk,"OBJECTIVE: Adolescents, older adults, African Americans, and rural residents are less likely to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder than their middle-aged white urban counterparts, receive appropriate treatment, remain on treatment once identified, and have positive outcomes. The Bipolar Disorder Center for Pennsylvanians (BDCP) study was designed to address these differences. This report highlights the methods used to recruit, screen, and enroll a cohort of hard-to-recruit individuals with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Study centers included three specialty bipolar disorder clinics in a university setting and one rural behavioral clinic. The study process was standardized and the entire study staff was trained in the study processes. Several strategies were used for recruitment. RESULTS: It was possible to implement the identical assessment and screening protocol in institutions regardless of whether they had implemented research protocols in the past. This protocol could also be used across the age range, in urban and rural settings, and in a racially diverse cohort of participants. The four sites enrolled 515 people with bipolar disorder as a result of these methods (69 African American and 446 non-African American). Although clinical characteristics at baseline did not differ appreciably between African Americans and non-African Americans, treatment pathways differed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous recruitment and assessment procedures can be successfully implemented in different settings and with different patient cohorts, facilitating access to quality treatment for individuals who often do not receive adequate treatment for bipolar disorder.",0,0,
271,Books and reading: evidence-based standard of care whose time has come,"Reach Out and Read (ROR) is the only clinical activity to advance child development in primary care that has been systematically evaluated across the United States. The ROR intervention is straightforward: Physicians provide advice on the benefits of reading aloud and provide books directly to at-risk children and parents to take home at each pediatric visit for children aged 6 months to 5 years. ROR builds on a significant body of evidence of the value of reading to young children. The studies evaluating ROR in different sites from people of different racial backgrounds and numerous outcome measures are consistently positive. From its first single site at Boston City Hospital in 1989 to over 4,600 clinical sites in 2010, over 30,000 clinicians distributed over 6.2 million books annually to 3.9 million children across the United States. Future efforts for ROR include the integration of mental health competencies found in the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines as part of the training of board specialists and physicians in the ROR paradigm, quality improvements to ensure fidelity to the intervention, and an expanded involvement of pediatric clinicians in local early childhood/school readiness collaborative efforts. Finally, the most important goal for the future is to take over the advice on reading aloud and the development-appropriate allocation of books to families at risk as best practice from official bodies.",0,0,
272,Borderline personality disorder in adolescence,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a common and serious mental disorder associated with severe functional impairment and a high rate of suicide. BPD is usually associated with other psychiatric and personality disorders, a high burden on families and caregivers, sustained resource use, and high treatment costs. BPD was a controversial diagnosis in adolescents, but it is no longer justified. Recent evidence indicates that adolescent BPD is as reliable and valid as that in adults, and that adolescents with BPD may benefit from early intervention. As a result, adolescent BPD is now recognized in psychiatric classification systems and in national treatment guidelines. This review aims to educate practitioners in the field of adolescent health about the nature of adolescent BPD and the benefits of early detection and intervention. BPD diagnosis and treatment should be considered part of routine adolescent mental health practice to improve the well-being and long-term prognosis of these individuals.",0,0,

274,Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines,"BACKGROUND: While there are international guidelines and various national guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, asthma remains poorly controlled in many children and adults. In this paper, we address the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining issues related to the use of asthma guidelines, particularly in primary care. DISCUSSION: Clinical practice guidelines based on evidence from randomized controlled trials are considered the most rigorous and accurate. However, current evidence-based guidelines are overwhelmingly written from the perspective of the patient with a clear diagnosis of asthma and tend to fail to account for the heterogeneity of asthma or to account for individual patient variations in terms of treatment or their needs, as well as differences in practice settings or local differences in the availability and cost of therapies. The results of randomized controlled trials designed to demonstrate treatment efficacy under ideal conditions may not apply to ""real world"" clinical practice where patients are not selected, monitoring is less frequent and efficacy - the usefulness of treatment in routine clinical practice – is the most relevant finding. In addition, most guidelines look at asthma in isolation, rather than considering other factors that may affect asthma and response to asthma therapy, particularly age, allergic rhinitis, cigarette smoking, adherence, and genetic factors. When these associations are recognized, guidelines rarely provide practical recommendations for treatment in these scenarios. Finally, there is evidence that general practitioners are not confident in the applicability of asthma guidelines in their practice, particularly when guideline writers work primarily in specialist practices. CONCLUSION: The development of country-specific guidelines, or ideally local guidelines, could provide more practical solutions for asthma care and could take into account regional factors influencing patient choice and treatment adherence. Pragmatic clinical trials and well-designed observational studies, in addition to randomized controlled trials, are needed to assess the effectiveness of therapies in practice, and such evidence must also be considered by guideline authors. Finally, practical tools are needed to diagnose and assess asthma and factors responsible for poor control, such as associated allergic rhinitis, impaired adherence and smoking behavior, to complement the treatment information provided in the clinical practice guidelines for asthma.",0,0,
275,"Breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening behaviors among African-American women: the Black Beautician Health Advancement Program","BACKGROUND: African American women have a higher death rate from breast cancer than their white counterparts. Studies have shown that this is partly caused by the detection of cancer at a later stage, underscoring the importance of promoting early detection of breast cancer in this population. This study examined whether a cohort of African American women living in San Diego had sufficient basic breast cancer screening knowledge to guide the development of a breast cancer awareness effort, to focus the health promotion efforts of other health educators and clinicians, and to adhere to commonly recommended screening guidelines. METHODS: African American women (N=1,055) from San Diego, California, participated in a beauty salon survey on breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices. The ages of the women ranged from 20 to 94 years, with a mean age of 42.20 (SD = 13.53) years. Thirty-four percent reported having completed college and/or graduate school education, and 52% reported having completed college or post-high school education. 75 percent of those surveyed said they work outside of their home. The participating estheticians and their salons were recruited for the study through word of mouth from highly respected African American community leaders. RESULTS: Salon clients reported low adherence to recommended breast cancer screening guidelines. Of the 1,055 participants, 31% said they perform breast self-exams every month. Of participants 40 years and older, 57% reported having had a clinical breast exam and 43% reported having had a mammogram in the past year. Awareness of breast cancer was associated with adherence to screening guidelines. While women recognized the serious health threat that breast cancer poses and that early detection of breast cancer is important, only 30% of women said they felt well informed about the disease. Many participants lacked basic knowledge about breast cancer. The Health Belief Model posits that access to such information is an essential element in developing screening behaviors. CONCLUSION: The data from this study reflect a continuing need for increased breast cancer education for African American women. Given the considerable amount of mainstream information that is available about breast cancer, these data reinforce the need for more breast cancer awareness programs that are clearly aimed at catching the attention of African American women.",0,0,
276,Bridging the Gap Between Pragmatic Intervention Design and Theory: Using Behavioral Science Tools to Modify an Existing Quality Improvement Program to Implement “Sepsis Six”,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis has a 40% mortality rate that can be halved if the evidence-based ""Sepsis Six"" package of care is implemented within 1 hour. UK audit shows low implementation rates. Interventions to improve this have had minimal impact. Quality improvement programs could be further developed by using theoretical frameworks (Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)) to modify existing interventions by identifying influences on clinical behavior and selecting appropriate content. The aim of this study was to illustrate the use of this process to modify an intervention developed using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles and partially successful in improving the implementation of Sepsis Six in a hospital was. METHODS: Factors influencing implementation were examined using the TDF to analyze interviews with 34 health professionals. The nursing team that designed and moderated the intervention used the data to select modifications using the Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy (v1) and the APEASE criteria: affordability, feasibility, efficacy, acceptability, safety, and equity.

This study examines the large-scale implementation of the National Multidisciplinary Guideline for Schizophrenia in the Netherlands. DESIGN: /st> observational study, prospective study, with repeated measures. SETTING: Thirty psychiatric teams in different regions of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine clinicians from diverse professional backgrounds and 1489 patients with schizophrenia. INTERVENTION(S): Six evidence-based interventions for schizophrenia were delivered as part of a quality improvement collaboration: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) or its adapted version Functional Assertive Community Treatment (FACT), cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, family interventions, individual mediation support, and pharmacotherapy. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT(S): Occupational performance, social functioning, and recidivism rates. RESULTS: Improved professional performance according to guidelines. The availability of (F)ACT improved from 23 to 60%. Individual placement support improved from 20% to 53%. Complete treatment plans were established for 38% of patients and routine outcome monitoring was implemented in most teams. Social functioning improved slightly (HoNOS mean: from 6.2 to 5.6). Relapse rates did not improve over the course of the study.

279,"Brief, physician-initiated smoking cessation strategies for clinical oncology settings: a study coordinated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group","PURPOSE: Although tobacco use increases the risk of recurrence, reduces treatment effectiveness, and worsens quality of life in cancer patients, about one-third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Since the patients are in regular contact with oncologists, the effectiveness of medical smoking cessation treatment was evaluated. METHODS: Cancer patients (n=432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a smoking intervention administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician. The primary endpoint was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry. RESULTS: At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in dropout rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention groups (14.4%), and there was no significant difference between the groups with the usual care (13.6%) and intervention groups (13.3%) at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking by 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, started smoking after age 16, reported at baseline that they had received advice on smoking in the past 6 months self-help to quit smoking or used treatment, and more showed a basic desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and demonstrated a greater baseline desire to quit smoking. Finally, physicians demonstrated greater adherence to the NIH model for physician smoking management among patients in the intervention group compared to the usual treatment group. CONCLUSION: While training physicians in treating cancer patients for smoking cessation may improve physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician interventions for smoking cessation do not result in significant increases in long-term smoking cessation rates in cancer patients.",0,0,

281,Capacity building for antiretroviral administration in South Africa: a qualitative assessment of the PALSA PLUS training program for nurses,"BACKGROUND: South Africa recently started a national antiretroviral treatment program. This has created an urgent need for training nurses in antiretroviral treatment (ART). The PALSA PLUS program provides guidelines and training for primary health care (PHC) nurses in the management of adult pulmonary disease and HIV/AIDS, including ART. A process evaluation was conducted to document the training, examine perceptions of the value of training, and compare the PALSA PLUS training approach (used at intervention sites) to the provincial training model. The evaluation was conducted in parallel with a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of PALSA PLUS nursing training (study reference number ISRCTN24820584). METHODS: Qualitative methods were used, including participant observation of training sessions, focus group discussions, and interviews. The data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Nurse acceptance of PALSA PLUS training was high, not only in terms of ART-specific components, but also in terms of lung health. The continuous on-site training of all PHC nurses, as opposed to the one-time central training offered for ART nurses only in non-interventional clinics, enhanced the nurses' experience of supporting their work by not only providing continuous experiential learning, supervision and emotional support, but also for the ongoing review of any infrastructure and system level changes required to facilitate healthcare provider behavior change and policy implementation. Training all PHC nurses to use the PALSA PLUS guideline as opposed to ART nurses alone was also seen as better integrating AIDS care into the clinical context. CONCLUSION: The PALSA PLUS training has successfully engaged all PHC nurses in a comprehensive approach to a range of diseases affecting both HIV positive and negative patients. PHC nursing education for integrated systems-based interventions should be prioritized on the ART funding agenda. However, behavior change training for individual providers is just one aspect of the ongoing system-wide interventions needed to bring about lasting improvement in patient care in the context of an overburdened and underfunded PHC system.",0,0,

Given recent concerns about the effectiveness of these structures, it is time to consider an evidence-based approach to their development and assessment. Aim To document an assessment framework for clinical networks by drawing on the network assessment literature and a 5-year study of clinical networks. Method We searched literature in three areas: network assessment, factors supporting or inhibiting network evolution, and robust methods for measuring network properties. This material was used to create a framework needed for effective development assessment. Results The architecture of the framework identifies three phases of clinical network development"";"" Partner selection, network design and network management. At each stage there are indications of factors that act as facilitators and obstacles to network growth. These factors can be used to measure progress using appropriate methods and tools. The framework can provide network growth and support informed decisions about progress.

METHOD: Consensus-building process involving a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and State Department of Education staff. RESULTS: The white paper represents the group's consensus on the essential components of a nationwide educational infrastructure to support the management of students with mTBI. The nature and recovery process of mTBI is briefly described, with particular reference to its impact on academic learning and performance. State and local policy considerations are then emphasized to encourage the implementation of a consistent process. Five key components to building a nationwide infrastructure for students with mTBI are outlined, including (1) definition and training of the interdisciplinary school team, (2) professional development of the school and medical communities, (3) identification, assessment, and progress monitoring protocols, (4) a flexible set of intervention strategies to meet students' recovery needs; and (5) systematized protocols for active communication among medical, school, and family team members. It is emphasized that research is required to guide effective program implementation. CONCLUSION: This guiding framework aims to support the development of support structures for recovering students with mTBI to optimize academic outcomes. Until more evidence is available on academic housing and other school-based support, education systems should follow current best practice guidance.",0,0,
284,"Building Trust: The History and Ongoing Relationships Between DSD Clinicians, Researchers, and Patient Advocacy Groups","Individuals born with sex development differences or disorders (DSD) have been marginalized from society and the healthcare system. The standards of care in the mid-20th century were based on fixing the child with DSD through hormonal and surgical intervention; these treatments and diagnoses were almost never disclosed to the child, and sometimes they were not disclosed to the parents. This led to secrecy, shame and stigma. As these children grew up and demanded access to their medical records, realizing the depth of the secrecy led to the formation of activist groups that rocked the medical community. Despite shaky beginnings, advocates, health professionals, and researchers have been able to bring about changes in the standard of care.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included: physical functioning, pain intensity, and psychological variables assessed before and after the program;” and medical certificate and work attendance, assessed before the program and recorded after six months. RESULTS: Significant advances were made in pain intensity, physical and psychological functioning, and medical certification. The mean effect size of the intervention was medium to large (d = 0.70). At the six-month follow-up, there was no significant change in employment status. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study suggest that independent rural and community-based practitioners working together using an integrated treatment program can achieve positive outcomes for injured workers with pain disability and outcomes similar to those experienced by metropolitan pain sufferers clinics are reported.",0,0,
288,Can computer-generated evidence-based treatment proposals improve evidence-based management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? A randomized controlled trial.,"objective. The translation of evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice has been inconsistent. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of guideline-based treatment suggestions submitted to physicians as they wrote prescriptions at computer workstations. study setting. Inner-city academic practice for general internal medicine. study design. Randomized controlled trial with 246 physicians (25 percent faculty general practitioners, 75 percent internal medicine residents) and 20 ambulatory pharmacists. We enrolled 706 of their primary care patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. When writing prescriptions or filling out prescriptions at computer workstations, half of the physicians and pharmacists selected at random were given supply suggestions for drugs and monitoring. A 2×2 factorial randomization of practice sessions and pharmacists resulted in four patient groups: physician intervention, pharmacist intervention, both interventions, and controls. Data Extraction/Collection Methods. Adherence to guidelines and clinical activity were assessed using patients' electronic medical records. Health-related quality of life, medication adherence, and satisfaction with care were recorded using telephone questionnaires. main results. During their year in the study, patients made an average of five scheduled primary care visits. There were no differences between groups in adherence to care recommendations, overall or condition-specific quality of life, satisfaction with physicians or pharmacists, medication adherence, emergency department visits, or hospital stays. Physicians who received the intervention had significantly higher overall healthcare costs. Physicians' attitudes towards the guidelines were mixed. Conclusions. Treatment recommendations shown to physicians and pharmacists at computer workstations did not impact the delivery or outcomes of treatment for patients with reactive airway disease.",1,1,
289,Can handheld computers improve compliance? A (Palm) pilot study of primary care physicians in British Columbia,"OBJECTIVE To study whether Palm Prevention, a free software tool for Palm OS Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) that provides quick access to patient-specific prevention guidelines at the point of care, improves adherence to five preventive interventions in primary care. DESIGN Prospective intervention pilot study. SETTING Vancouver, BC, and Vicinity. PARTICIPANTS Eight general practitioners. INTERVENTIONS Each physician used Palm Prevention for five preventive interventions during routine check-ups in 10 patients (n=80). Charts from consenting patients were reviewed to document the recommended maneuvers. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Adherence rates to five evidence-based guidelines selected by the Canadian and US Prevention Task Forces and incorporated into Palm Prevention. RESULTS Intervention and control physicians were similar in their familiarity with and use of epidurals and recruited similar patients for the study. Intervention and control groups had similar screening rates for hypertension. The intervention improved adherence to the remaining four guidelines: cervical cancer screening increased by 22% (only absolute increases are reported), hyperlipidemia screening increased by 30%, colorectal cancer screening increased by 27%, and acetylsalicylic acid prophylaxis in high-risk patients by 38% % increased Participants were interviewed after the study;"" all indicated that they found the software helpful and would continue to use Palm Prevention. Usage statistics showed that study participants used the tool outside of the study: During the two-month intervention, users took between 28 and 68 individual patients enrolled in the program CONCLUSION This pilot study suggests that PDAs are useful in improving prevention and facilitating the transfer of knowledge into practice, particularly with recent guidelines.",0,1,
290,Can lineage clinicians master the conceptual complexities of dialectical behavior therapy? An evaluation of a State Department of Mental Health training program,"Dialectical-behavioral therapy for borderline personality disorder has quickly gained widespread popularity, with an indication of the development of educational initiatives by the Department of Mental Health in at least two states in the United States. Efficacy data published by the treatment's originator, Marsha Linehan, and her colleagues likely explain, at least in part, this popularity. However, the complexity of DBT raises a fundamental question related to these broader applications: Can clinicians from different backgrounds achieve a common and differentiated understanding of treatment theory? Clinical usefulness of treatment relies heavily on ease of dissemination (APA, Template for developing guidelines: Interventions in mental disorders and psychosocial aspects of physical disorders. Washington, DC: Author, 1995) and in this regard DBT - a complicated, multi-faceted approach - might appear vulnerable. This vulnerability is compounded when institutional adoption involves the collaboration of numerous clinicians who, despite different roles, still need to develop a common understanding of treatment. Through a detailed survey of DBT knowledge, we assessed the conceptual proficiency of 109 clinicians trained through an initiative of the State Department of Mental Health. Exam performance correlated specifically with DBT training. Prior training or background in behavioral therapy accounted for little variation, suggesting that clinicians filling different roles gained adequate intellectual mastery of this complex model.",0,0,
291,"""Can patient practice be increased simply by implementing agreed national guidelines?"" An observational study","OBJECTIVE: To increase the autonomous exercise time of patients in the stroke unit of a nursing home. INTERVENTION: Nurses stimulated and exercised patients using four interventions (muscle strengthening, sitting balance and reach, rising from a chair, walking) from the evidence-based guidelines for clinical nursing rehabilitation after stroke. DESIGN: An observational study. The exercise time of elderly stroke patients in this study was compared to the time observed in our previous study in the same setting. SETTING: Rehabilitation units of a nursing home in the Netherlands. PROJECTS: Seventeen frail stroke patients, including 8 males, 9 females, with a mean age of 75.8 (SD +/- 9) and 17 subjects with the same characteristics, who participated in a previous observational study. MAIN MEASURES: The time spent on therapeutic activities was measured using the behavioral mapping method. RESULTS: The time spent in therapeutic activities increased significantly from 103.5 minutes measured in our previous study to 156.5 minutes in this study (Z = 2.86""; P < 0.005;"" d' = 1.09). The mean Barthel Index score was 8.8 (SD +/- 4.1). The patients with more options were more active, resulting in a significantly positive Barthel Index-therapy time relationship (r=0.73, P</=0.001). Conclusions: Autonomous exercise time in elderly fragile comorbid stroke patients increased during weekdays. Patients who are stimulated and challenged by caregivers train harder and more within their capabilities. Because this guide is specifically designed for caregivers, caregivers can encourage stroke survivors to be more involved in autonomous practice, thereby contributing to their recovery.",0,0,
292,Can psychological models bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and clinician behavior? A randomized controlled trial of an intervention to influence dentist intention to adopt evidence-based practice,"OBJECTIVE: The delay between publication of clinical practice evidence and implementation by clinicians can be decades. Research using psychological models shows that changing intention is very important for behavior change. This study evaluated an intervention (trying alternative measures) to change dentists' intent to implement evidence-based practices (EBP) for third molar (TM) management. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial/postal. SETTING: Basic care. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Dentists were randomly selected from the Scottish Dental Practice Board register, then randomly assigned to intervention or control groups and sent a questionnaire. The intervention group listed management alternatives to TM extraction prior to their TM extraction intention, the control group did not. Based on psychological models for reducing the frequency of a behavior (EBP is weighted against TM extraction), prior listing of alternatives should reduce extraction intent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intent to extract TMs. RESULTS: A total of 99 dentists - 70 men, 29 women”; Mean age = 41.42 years (SD = 8.62) participated in the study. The intervention significantly influenced intention to extract TMs as desired. Despite similar backgrounds and knowledge of treatment alternatives, participants in the intervention group had significantly lower extraction intent: control group mean (SD) = 0.39 (1.99); Intervention group mean (SD) = -0.78 (1.89); mean difference (SE) = 1.17 (0.42);"" 95% confidence interval for the difference = 0.34 to 1.99. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this intervention, which was successful, is a proximal predictor of Behavior related to dental EBP may lead to improved EBP in a service-level study Basing implementation interventions and study methodology on psychological models can effectively bridge the gap between clinical guidelines and practice.",0,1,
293,Can we address depression in visual rehabilitation facilities? Professionals' perspectives on the barriers to the integration of problem-solving treatments,"PURPOSE: Given the high prevalence of untreated depression in adults with visual impairment, low-vision rehabilitation (LVR) is a relevant context for the integration of early, evidence-based psychological interventions. This study aims to identify the perceived barriers and intermediaries to staff-delivered primary care telephone troubleshooting (PST-PC), offered as an integrated component of LVR. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews, developed using the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), were conducted with 21 LVR experts and one clinical psychologist involved in the delivery of PST-PC. Barriers and intermediaries at the practitioner, client, intervention and organization levels were identified with thematic analysis using a 'theoretical' approach. RESULTS: Prominent barriers were a lack of role recognition for PST-PC practitioners (n=32), unmet customer expectations with PST-PC (n=28), dissatisfaction with phone delivery (n=27), and limited organizational awareness of PST- pc (n=39). Supporting factors included a recognized need for evidence-based psychological services (n=28), clients experiencing benefits in early sessions (n=38), PST-PC promoting practical skills (n=26), and comprehensive PST- PC training (n = 26). = 36). CONCLUSIONS: PST-PC may provide an accessible early intervention for LVR clients with depressive symptoms. Ongoing physician education, clinical support, and treatment eligibility screening of potential LVR clients are likely to improve delivery in this environment. Implications for rehabilitation Depression is common among adults participating in low-vision rehabilitation (LVR) programs, but few receive support. Clinical guidelines recommend offering integrated care models within rehabilitation facilities as early intervention for mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Integrated primary care telephone problem-solving treatment (PST-PC), delivered by trained LVR practitioners, is a practical, competency-based model that has the potential to improve access to early psychological intervention in LVR clients with depressive symptoms . LVR clients are often elderly, have multiple comorbid health conditions, and significant levels of functional disability, requiring flexibility in providing PST-PC and specialist staff training, as well as support in working with older and more complex clients.",0,0,
294,"Can we improve adherence to guidelines for treating lower urinary tract infections? A simple, versatile intervention in emergency services","OBJECTIVES: To improve antibiotic prescribing behavior of primary care physicians in large-scale on-call services for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (LUTI) in women aged 20-80 years, considered to be one of the most common bacterial infections in primary care. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used in two regional large after-hours services. In one region (the intervention region) a simple, varied intervention was offered over a period of 16 weeks. During the two washout periods, at 5 and 17 months, we observed diagnoses and prescriptions. The main outcome measure was the proportion of appropriate and inappropriate prescriptions. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with LUTI ranged from 1.0% to 2.1%. The relative proportion of appropriate prescriptions in the intervention region rose from 26.9% to 69.4%, but then fell to 40.8%. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, multifaceted intervention to manage LUTI during out-of-hours care can improve the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, although the improvement may not last in the longer term.",0,1,

Healthcare providers should provide practical information about the wide range of contraceptive options and their potential non-contraceptive benefits, and help women and their partners determine the most appropriate method of use. (III-B) 11. Health care providers should help women and men to develop the skills necessary to negotiate contraceptive use and the correct and consistent use of a chosen method. (III-B) 12. Preventive measures should include discussion and management of the risk of sexually transmitted infection, including appropriate recommendations for condom use and double protection, STI screening, post-exposure prophylaxis, and vaccination for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus. (III-B) 13. Healthcare providers should emphasize the use of condoms not only for protection against sexually transmitted infections, but also as a backup method when compliance with a hormonal contraceptive might be suboptimal.

297,"Canadian guidelines for the evidence-based treatment of tic disorders: behavioral therapy, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation","This clinical guideline provides recommendations for non-pharmacological treatments of tic disorders. We performed a systematic literature search for clinical trials on the treatment of tics. One evidence-based review (including 30 studies) and 3 behavioral intervention studies, 3 deep brain stimulation (DBS) studies, and 3 transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies met our inclusion criteria. Based on this evidence, we have made strong recommendations for the use of habit reversal therapy and exposure and response prevention, preferably embedded in a supportive, psychoeducational program and with the option to combine either of these approaches with pharmacotherapy. Although there is evidence for the effectiveness of DBS, the quality of this evidence is poor and the risks and burdens of the procedure are delicately balanced with the perceived benefits. Our recommendation is that this intervention continues to be viewed as an experimental treatment for severe, medically refractory tics that have severely reduced quality of life. We recommend that the procedure should only be performed within the context of research studies and by physicians who are experts in DBS programming and tic management. There is no evidence to support the use of TMS in the treatment of tics. However, the procedure has a low rate of known complications and could continue to be evaluated as part of research protocols. The recommendations we give are based on the current state of knowledge and further study may lead to a revision in the future.",0,0,
298,Canadian Survey of Clinical Status at Dialysis Initiation 1998-1999: a multicenter prospective survey,"OBJECTIVES: Recent growth in end-stage renal disease populations has prompted increased efforts to understand the impact of dialysis-initiating status on long-term outcomes. Our main goal was to increase the understanding of current Canadian nephrology practice between October 1998 and December 1999. METHODS: Fifteen renal centers in 7 provinces participated in a prospective data collection study. The main outcome of interest was the clinical status at the start of dialysis, determined by: residual renal function, willingness to undergo chronic dialysis as measured by the presence or absence of a permanent peritoneal or hemodialysis line, hemoglobin and serum albumin. Uremic symptoms at dialysis initiation were also recorded, but in some cases these symptom data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: Data were collected from 251 patients during 1-month periods. Patients started dialysis at mean calculated creatinine clearance values of approximately 10 mL/min with an average of 3 symptoms. 35% of dialysis patients had been known to nephrologists for less than 3 months. These patients are more likely to start without permanent access and with lower hemoglobin and albumin levels. Even of those known to nephrologists, only 66% had permanent access. CONCLUSIONS: Patients starting dialysis in Canada appear to do so in relative agreement with published guidelines regarding when to start. Despite increased awareness of kidney disease, a significant number of patients continue to begin dialysis without prior nephrologist care. Those seen by nephrologists have suboptimal clinical and laboratory parameters according to current guidelines. This survey serves as an important basis for future comparisons after implementation of training strategies for referring physicians and nephrologists.",0,0,
299,Cancer among adolescents in France between 1988 and 1997,"We report a cancer pathway in adolescents from referral to diagnosis and treatment to follow-up in France. All cancer cases between 15 and 19 years old, diagnosed between 1988 and 1997 and recorded by nine French population cancer registries (10% of the French population) were included. Treatment of adolescent cancer by pediatricians was rare. An adolescent's journey through cancer care can be summarized as follows: initial visit to the primary care physician, referral to an adult oncologist for hematologic malignancies and medical or surgical specialists for solid tumors, treatment in the adult unit, and follow-up by an adult oncologist, an adult medical practitioner or surgeon specialist or general practitioner. Only 9% of 15-19 year olds participate in a clinical trial (6% and 3% in adult and pediatric clinical trials, respectively). Inclusion rate varies by diagnosis, higher in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (39%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (27%), and acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (20%). Only 4% of adolescent cancers were treated in shared adult and pediatric wards, particularly soft tissue sarcoma (14.9%), malignant bone tumors (13.4%), central nervous system tumors (6.2%) and NHL (4th .4%). Whatever the reasons for non-participation in clinical trials, an ideal model that requires communication and collaboration between all adult and pediatric specialists involved in adolescent cancer care should reduce the large gap in access to collaborative groups.",0,0,
300,Cancer awareness among primary care physicians in an underserved community,"INTRODUCTION: Urban minority groups, such as those living in north Manhattan, are generally underserved when it comes to cancer prevention and screening. GPs are in a crucial position when it comes to advising their patients on these issues and ordering screening tests for their patients. METHODS: Eighty-four primary care physicians in two intervention communities who received educational visits about cancer screening and prevention were compared with 38 physicians in a nearby community who received no intervention. In pre- and post-test interviews over an 18-month period, physicians were asked about their attitude, knowledge (relative to American Cancer Society guidelines), and likelihood of breast, cervical, colon, and cervical counseling and screening prostate asked cancer. RESULTS: The comparison of the two physician surveys revealed no statistically significant differences in knowledge about cancer prevention or screening. However, at post-test, physicians in the intervention group identified significantly fewer barriers to practice than physicians in the control group (p<0.05). While the educational visits to inner-city GPs did not appear to significantly alter overall cancer prevention practices, a positive dose-response relationship was demonstrated in the subset of participants who received three or more project contacts. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered significant changes in attitudes based on academic detailing among city primary care physicians practicing in north Manhattan. A significant pre-test sensitization effect and low numbers may have obscured overall changes in cancer prevention and physician screening behaviors due to the intervention.",0,0,
301,Cancer-related and treatment-related fatigue,"Fatigue is a distressing and persistent symptom for patients with gynecologic cancer and survivors. Debilitating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is caused by both the disease and its treatment. Although awareness and investigation of CKD has increased in recent years, consistent assessment has not been a priority in routine medical practice. The pathophysiological mechanisms that induce CKD remain unclear, and effective pharmacological interventions have yet to be established. Based on the literature and our own research, this review focuses on recent advances in understanding the nature and causes of CKD and on several promising treatment modalities. Given the prevalence and severity of CKD in the gynecologic cancer patient population, the establishment of standardized fatigue measurement and management methods in routine clinical oncology care is of paramount importance. However, whether CKD has an underlying inflammatory cause is still hypothetical, and no mechanism-driven symptom intervention is currently used clinically, although the development of such interventions would offer patients better symptom control. To advance translational and clinical fatigue research, anatomical pathway studies and well-designed clinical investigations are required, focusing on the development of mechanism-driven interventions based on physiological-behavioural fatigue research, the implementation of guidelines for experimental designs, and the discovery of biomarkers for Identifying individuals at high stress risk for CKD. Validated patient-reported outcome measurements are an essential part of such clinical trials. Because there are numerous subscales, one-dimensional measures, and multidimensional measures, clinicians and researchers should consider individual circumstances, good clinical practice, and research goals as a guide to selecting the most appropriate fatigue measurement instrument. In addition, education about CKD should be made available to all patients and their caregivers, as accurate and age-appropriate information about conditions such as CKD can alleviate much of the stress and anxiety that arises from poor communication about this debilitating condition.",0,0,
302,Interactions with cardiac drugs and psychotropic drugs: importance and recommendations,"Understanding the cardiac drug interactions associated with the concomitant prescription of psychotropic drugs is critical for the practicing cardiologist and general practitioner, as well as for the psychiatrist. In both psychiatry and cardiology, there has been an explosion in the use of new drugs without widespread knowledge of their potential interactions. The increasing trend towards polypharmacy, the use of psychotropic drugs by cardiologists and general practitioners caring for cardiac patients, and the increasing aging of the population pose major challenges for practitioners. Finally, there is a need for models/paradigms to predict possible drug interactions - e.g. B. the cytochrome p450 scheme. This paper describes a method for identifying, understanding, and codifying the interactions between psychotropic drugs and cardiac drugs, a systematic approach to updating this key database, and specific interactions between cardiac psychotropic drugs. In particular, this document 1) describes the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical significance, 3) describes the potential mechanisms of the interactions, and 4) provides recommendations for the clinician. Because the majority of original clinical trials, whether for cardiac drugs or psychotropic drugs, do not include studies comparing these two drug domains simultaneously, their interactions are often not known until their combined use in the clinical setting, using the patient as a ""guinea pig"" , "" and through subsequent reporting.",0,0,
303,Cardiac rehabilitation and risk factor management after myocardial infarction. Clinical and economic evaluation,"The increasing scarcity of available and limited health care resources and the increased demands on health care have made considering the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of health services, such as B. the secondary prevention of heart disease, a necessity. There is considerable evidence that changing cigarette smoking habits, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and physical inactivity, either individually or in combination, are effective in reducing the number of clinical events in secondary prevention of heart disease. Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action with regard to costs and consequences. Data generated during economic assessments of health services, such as B. the modification of risk factors in the secondary prevention of heart disease, are useful in the development of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies. Smoking cessation is the most cost-effective intervention for patients with established cardiac disease, while treatment for hyperlipidemia and referral for cardiac rehabilitation are very cost-effective per quality-adjusted life-year and relatively cost-effective per life-year saved. Management of risk factors, performed by a team of cardiovascular specialists and other physicians together with appropriately trained healthcare professionals, is the cornerstone of optimal care in both the primary and secondary prevention of heart disease.",0,0,
304,Cardiac Rehabilitation: Unraveling the Complexities of Referrals and Current Delivery Models,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines recommend strategies to reduce risk factors for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndromes, but referral to and completion of programs to provide this advice are inadequate. PURPOSE: In this article, we describe the complexity of the factors affecting the referral and delivery of evidence-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in an Australian context and provide guidance for solutions for clinicians and policy makers to consider. The ecological approach is used as a framework for synthesizing evidence. The approach includes 5 categories whose characteristics can act as barriers and enablers to the promotion and adoption of health behaviors, and includes (a) interpersonal factors, (b) interpersonal factors, (c) institutional factors, (d) community networks, and (e ) public order. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the context of strong evidence for efficacy, this review highlights systematic shortcomings in the implementation of CR, an important intervention that has been shown to improve patient outcomes and prevent cardiac events. Recommendations from this review include standardizing program delivery, improving data collection, leveraging technological innovation and social networking to facilitate the delivery of information and support, and establishing a coherent, consistent message through cross-organizational collaboration in CR. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: These pathways indicate potential solutions to improve CR uptake and secondary prevention.",0,0,
305,Care in Specialized Medical and Mental Health Units Compared with Standard Care for Elderly People with Cognitive Impairment Admitted to a General Hospital: Randomized Controlled Trial (NIHR TEAM Trial),"GOAL Development and evaluation of a best-practice model for general medical acute care of older people with cognitive impairment. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial adjusted to account for the limitations imposed by a busy medical admissions system. RECRUITMENT Large general acute hospital in the UK. PARTICIPANTS 600 patients over the age of 65 admitted for acute medical care who were identified as “confused” on admission. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to a specialist medical and mental health unit designed to provide best practice care for people with delirium or dementia, or to standard care (acute geriatric or general medicine units). Characteristics of the department included a ""joint staffing of medical and mental health workers"", improved staff training in delirium, dementia and person-centered dementia care, provision of organized, goal-oriented activities, changing the environment to meet the needs of people with cognitive impairments , delirium prevention, and a proactive and inclusive approach to caregivers.RESULTS There was no significant difference in days spent at home between the specialty and standard care groups (median 51 vs. 45 days, 95% confidence interval for the difference -12 to 24; P=0.3).The median index hospital stay was 11 versus 11 days, mortality 22% versus 25% (-9% to 4%), readmission 32% versus 35% (-10% to 5%) and new admissions to the nursing home 20% compared to 28% (-16% to 0) for the specialist department or the state ard care group. Patients who returned home spent a median of 70.5 versus 71.0 days at home (-6.0 to 6.5). Patients in the specialty department spent significantly more time with positive mood or engagement (79% vs. 68%, 2% to 20%; P=0.03) and experienced more interactions with staff that met emotional and psychological needs (median 4 vs. 1 per observation; P<0.001). More caregivers were satisfied with care (overall 91% vs. 83%, 2% to 15%; P=0.004) and strong dissatisfaction was lower (5% vs. 10%, -10% to 0%; P= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Specialist care for people with delirium and dementia improved patient experience and caregiver satisfaction, but there were no convincing benefits related to health status or service utilization. Patient experience and caregiver satisfaction may be more appropriate measures of success for frail elderly people approaching the end of life STUDY REGISTRATION Clinical Studies NCT01136148.",0,0,
306,Caring for Adults with Developmental Disabilities: Effects of a Continuing Education Course for Primary Caregivers,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effects of interdisciplinary, guideline-based further education on measures for the care of adults with developmental disabilities (DD). DESIGN: Before-after study with a control group. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven primary care providers (physicians, registered nurses and registered nurses). INTERVENTION: Participants either received only reference material on primary care for people with DD (control group) or participated in a continuing education course on primary care for people with DD (intervention group) in addition to the reference material. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported 5 key measures related to the care of adults with DD: frequency of use of guidelines, frequency of completion of regular health assessments, frequency of assessment of patients presenting with behavior changes, level of comfort in caring for adults with DD, and primary care knowledge of adults with DD. RESULTS: Over time, the intervention group showed significant increases in 4 of the 5 key measures of care compared to the control group: frequency of guideline application (P<0.001), frequency of rating patients' behavior change (P=0.001). 03), level of comfort in caring for people with DD (P=0.01), and knowledge of primary care in relation to adults with DD (P=0.01).

307,Caring for the menopausal patient: a nurse's perspective,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of hormone therapy (HT) and other treatment options for early postmenopausal women. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical studies, selected peer-reviewed literature, and current clinical practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies on HT may not be directly applicable to healthy, early postmenopausal women who experience hot flashes. HT is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms. The benefits of HT in relieving menopausal symptoms likely outweigh the risks in this population. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: GHI results underscore the importance of individualized care based on a woman's medical history, medical needs, and desired outcomes. Nurses can help their patients put recent results into perspective. If HT is used, caregivers should consider using lower doses and reassess the need for therapy annually.",0,0,
308,Monitoring of CD4 cell count and viral load in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: cost-effectiveness study,"AIM To investigate the cost and cost-effectiveness of quarterly monitoring of CD4 cell count and viral load in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). DESIGN profitability study. SETTING A randomized trial in a home ART program in Tororo, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS People living with HIV who were members of the AIDS Support Organization and had a CD4 cell count < 250 × 10(6) cells/L or World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes calculated for the study period and projected 15 years into the future included costs, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs); $ per DALY averted). Cost inputs were based on the study and other sources Clinical inputs from the study In the base case, we assumed that point estimates reflect true differences even if they are not significant We performed univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyzes INTERVENTIONS Three surveillance strategies: clinical surveillance with quarterly CD4 cell counts and measurement of viral load (clinical/CD4/viral load); clinical surveillance and quarterly CD4 counts (clinical/CD4);"" and clinical surveillance alone. RESULTS Using intention to treat (ITT) results per 100 people starting ART, we found that clinical/CD4 surveillance and 117.3 DALYs prevented (ICER = $174 per DALY) compared to clinical monitoring alone. Monitoring adds $142,458 and eliminates 27.5 DALYs ($5,181 per DALY) The superior ICER for clinical/CD4 monitoring is robust to input value uncertainty, and this strategy compares favorably to clinical/CD4/viral load monitoring dominant (less expensive and more effective) in a quarter of the simulations If the clinical inputs are based on the as-treated analysis from 90 days (after the start of laboratory monitoring), then the clinical/CD4/viral load exercise Surveillance dominated by other strategies. CONCLUSIONS Based on this study, routine CD4 cell count monitoring is significantly less expensive than adding routine viral load testing to the monitoring strategy and less expensive than ART compared to clinical surveillance alone.",0,0,
309,Cervical cancer screening in adolescents: an evidence-based internet educational program to improve practice among advanced nurses,"BACKGROUND: The literature reports large differences in the level of knowledge and application of recent changes in guidelines for cervical cancer screening in clinical practice. Evidence-based screening guidelines for cervical cancer prevention and screening offer healthcare providers an opportunity to improve practice patterns among adolescent girls by reducing psychological distress, healthcare costs, and morbidity associated with over-screening. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot interventional study was to determine the impact of a web-based continuing education program (CEU) on the knowledge of advanced nurse practitioners (APNs) of current evidence-based recommendations for cervical cancer screening and their application in practice. This paper presents a process improvement project as an example of a way to disseminate updated evidence-based practice guidelines among busy healthcare providers. METHODS: This web-based CEU program was designed, tested and evaluated specifically for APNs. The program addressed their level of knowledge about cervical cancer and its relationship to the high-risk human papillomavirus. It also looked at the new guidelines for the early detection of cervical cancer and the application of these guidelines in clinical practice. RESULTS: The results of the study indicate that there are gaps in knowledge about early detection of cervical cancer in adolescents in APNs. However, when provided with CEU education, APNs' level of knowledge increased and their self-reported behavior in clinical practice changed, in line with the new guidelines for cervical cancer screening. LINKING EVIDENCE TO PRACTICE: The provision of convenient and easily accessible up-to-date electronic content that CEU provides promotes the adoption of clinical practice guidelines, thereby reducing the potential of morbidities associated with over-screening for cervical cancer in adolescents and young women are connected.",0,0,
310,Challenges and opportunities associated with the deployment of next-generation durable insecticide nets for malaria control: a case study from Burkina Faso,"Background The decline in malaria incidence in Africa can be largely attributed to the increase in malaria vector control activities, primarily the use of long-lived insecticide nets (LLINs). conventional LLINs, there is an increasing urgency to implement alternative tools that control these resistant populations. The aim of this study was to identify potential challenges and opportunities for faster access to next-generation LLINs in Burkina Faso, a country with areas of high concentrations of, to identify insecticide resistance Methods An analytical framework was used to guide interviewee selection, data collection and analysis Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants in April 2014 in Burkina Faso Interviews were conducted in French and English, audio recorded and transcribed and entered into NVivo 10 for data management and analysis. They are coded according to the framework themes and then analyzed to provide a description of key points and to explain patterns in the data. Findings Respondents reported that the political architecture in Burkina Faso is characterized by a strong framework of actors contributing to policy-making and strong national research capacities contributing indirectly to national policy changes through collaboration with internationally-led research. Funding has a significant impact on the potential adoption, availability and affordability of next-generation LLINs. This gives significant power to international donors who fund vector control. National decisions about sourcing LLINs have been limited to quantity and delivery dates.” The potential to control insecticide resistance was not part of the decision-making process. In addition, there was no World Health Organization (WHO) at the time of the study. Guidance on where and when next-generation LLINs might have a positive impact on malaria transmission, severely limiting their acceptability, availability, and affordability Conclusions This study shows that access to next-generation LLINs has been severely hampered by the lack of global guidance Burkina Faso, where WHO recommendations are being adopted relatively quickly, clear WHO recommendation and adequate funding will be key to accelerate access to next-generation LLINs.",0,0,
311,"Mutability, Trust, Common Sense, and Affirmation: Comprehensive Assessment of Suicide Risk","AIM: The authors, in collaboration with NSW Health, recently developed a comprehensive framework for assessing suicide risk. This paper describes key concepts in the assessment of suicide risk by mental health professionals. METHODS: A framework for conducting a comprehensive suicide risk assessment was derived from the literature, analysis of incidents, and clinical experience. The framework has been subject to a consultation process involving clinicians from the mental health services in the NSW area. The aim was to provide physicians with a standardized conceptual map for assessing suicide risk. A MEDLINE search was conducted for publications dealing with ""suicide"" and ""suicide risk assessment"" from 1980 to 2002. The recommendations of sentinel event reviews conducted in a NSW area psychiatric service in 1999-2002 were reviewed. Findings from a visit to a coroner's family support group for people betrayed by suicide also influenced the development of the guidelines. RESULTS: A framework for assessing suicide risk is proposed. The framework promotes a reflective style of practice and encourages clinicians to evaluate their judgment and limitations. The risk assessment is always performed as part of a full clinical assessment and an assessment of the person's current predicament and psychosociocultural context. The concepts of changeability, confidence in assessment, common sense, and the importance of affirmation are built into the framework. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health clinicians can use a framework for assessing and documenting suicide risk. Assessing suicide risk can result in a suicide risk rating, for which minimum standards of care can be mandated.",0,0,
312,Changes and challenges: Coping with ADHD in a fast-paced world,"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) disrupts the lives of children and adults. Left undiagnosed and untreated, ADHD can have serious lifelong consequences. Research has identified diagnostic cues, neurotransmitter pathways, and psychiatric comorbidities associated with ADHD, as well as effective pharmacological, behavioral, and psychosocial interventions. Stimulants have been the basis of ADHD therapy for more than 50 years. The availability of new sustained-release (XR or ER) and longer-acting (LA) formulations and novel active ingredients allow for broader and more individualized treatment options. Stimulant side effects are generally mild, short-lived, and responsive to adjustments in dosage or timing. ADHD treatment outcomes can be improved through the use of clear treatment guidelines and tools that help clinicians implement them efficiently and effectively. The Texas Children's Medication Algorithm Project (CMAP) provides a system of algorithm-driven treatment decisions that is evidence-based and easy to implement. AIM: (1) To review the psychological components of attention, the neurotransmitter pathways associated with ADHD, and the range of therapeutic options for ADHD, with emphasis on recent introductions to the therapeutic armamentarium”; (2) discussion of the rare psychiatric and cardiovascular side effects associated with stimulants; (3) review abuse liability, comorbidities, and proposed approaches to these issues;"" and (4) review the development and use of CMAP and offer resources for its implementation in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: The pathophysiology of ADHD is associated with dysfunction of the fronto -subcortical networks and a dysregulation of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and nicotinic neurotransmitter systems. An additive effect of several genes as well as environmental influences contributes to the clinical picture. Treatment with stimulants and non-stimulants has been shown to be effective in different subgroups, with the effectiveness of specific agents most likely being related to the primary neurotransmitters involved The availability of formulations containing XR, ER, LA, and transdermal stimulants, as well as alternative non-stimulant agents, offers new options for the pharmacotherapy of ADHD Issues associated with stimulant abuse liability have been eliminated by the availability of ER formulations that have reduced potentiating effects associated with short-acting preparations. Medication outcomes in ADHD can be improved by using evidence-based algorithms such as CMAP. Keys to success are appropriate initial assessment and diagnosis, use of sustained-release products, adequate dose titration, and use of clinical rating scales with feedback from caregivers and teachers. Optimal treatment results can be achieved through appropriate pharmacotherapy in combination with psychosocial interventions.",0,0,
313,"Changes in the attitudes, self-efficacy, intention, knowledge and skills of insurance physicians regarding the guidelines for depression following an implementation strategy","INTRODUCTION: To improve guideline adherence by panellists (IPs), an implementation strategy was developed and evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. This implementation strategy included a multifaceted training program for a group of IPs in the use of the depression guidelines. In this study, we report the impact of implementation strategy on physician attitudes, intent, self-efficacy, and knowledge and skills as behavioral determinants of guideline adherence. Any associations between these self-reported behavioral determinants and levels of compliance were also determined. Methods: Immediately before and 3 months after the implementation of the multifaceted training, the intervention (n = 21) and a questionnaire measuring behavioral determinants based on the ASE model (attitude, social norm, self-efficacy) were completed by the control group (n = 19 ). Questionnaire items were grouped to form scales of ASE determinants. The internal consistency of the scales was calculated using Cronbach's alphas. Differences between groups in changes in ASE determinants and the association of these changes with improvements in compliance were analyzed using an analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the scales of the ASE determinants proved to be sufficiently reliable with Cronbach's alphas of at least 0.70. At the 3-month follow-up, the IPs with the implementation strategy showed significant improvement over the IPs in the control group for all ASE determinants examined. Changes in knowledge and skills were only weakly associated with improvements in guideline adherence. Conclusions: The implementation strategy developed for insurance physicians can increase their attitude, intention, self-efficacy, and knowledge and skills in applying the guidelines for depression. These changes in the behavioral determinants may indicate positive changes in the IPs' behavior towards the use of the depression guidelines. However, only changes in the knowledge and skills associated with applying the policies were associated with improvements in the IPs' actual performance in applying the policies.",0,0,
314,Lifestyle changes after nurse counseling: 1-year results of the Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle Study,"OBJECTIVES: The Groningen Overweight and Lifestyle (GOAL) Study primarily aims to prevent weight gain by caregivers (NP) guided by a standardized computerized software program. Because favorable changes in physical activity (PA) and diet can improve health regardless of weight (loss), insight into the impact on lifestyle habits is essential. We examined the 1-year effects of lifestyle counseling by NP on PA and diet compared to usual GP care (GP-UC). DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Eleven general practice locations in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 341 GOAL participants with overweight or obesity and either hypertension or dyslipidemia or both who completed an FFQ and a brief Health Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH) Assessment Questionnaire at baseline and at 1 year. RESULTS: At 1 year, the NP group spent 33 min/week more walking compared to the GP-UC group, which spent -5 min/week walking (P=0.05). No significant differences were found between the NP and GP-UC groups in the percentage of subjects adhering to the PA guidelines. In both groups, nutrient intake changed in a favorable direction and participants adhered to dietary guidelines more often, but with no overall difference between the NP and GP-UC groups. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of an increase in walking (based on self-reported data) in the NP group, there were no intervention effects on PA and diet. Positive changes in nutrient intake were observed in both groups.",0,0,
315,Changes in caregiver knowledge and behavior after brief training on Healthy Eating and Activity Sharing (HEAT) guidelines.,"INTRODUCTION: Primary care providers, particularly pediatric nurses, are a key force in combating the adolescent obesity epidemic. However, the majority of nurses report poor knowledge of their ability to adequately prevent and manage pediatric obesity. In response, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners (NAPNAP) developed the evidence-based Healthy Eating and Activity Together (HEAT) Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) to improve provider behavior and effectiveness. METHOD: 35 practicing nurse practitioners attending the NAPNAP annual conference underwent an intensive 4-hour HEAT-CPG training session. Before and after the training, data was collected on providers' knowledge, practices and barriers to preventing obesity in adolescents. RESULTS: Results after exercise indicated significant improvements in (a) physician's knowledge (assessment of patient's growth, family history, psychosocial functioning, diet, and physical activity)""; (b) physician's intent to improve behavior ( d Use behavior modification and counseling aimed at changing the behavior of patients and families);"" and (c) practitioners' report of increased confidence in ability to address barriers. DISCUSSION: The study results show preliminary support for the HEAT CPG as an effective tool aimed at helping providers improve their ability to maintain healthy weight in patients. Future research is needed to verify the impact of HEAT CPG on long-term improvements in care.",0,0,
316,Changes in nursing home residents during innovation based on the theory of gerotranscendence,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate how residents were affected when an intervention based on the theory of gerotranscendence and guidelines derived from it were introduced in a nursing home. BACKGROUND: The notion that communication is essential in staff-resident interactions is widely accepted in both theory and practice, as is the notion that communicative behavior influences patient outcomes. To date, no studies have focused on whether residents are influenced by staff's use of guidelines derived from gerotranscendence theory. DESIGN: The study was exploratory in nature and used a qualitative approach. Methods: Data was collected through resident interviews and participatory observations; a qualitative content analysis was carried out. SAMPLE SIZE: six residents. RESULTS: The study shows that many residents reviewed and reflected on their lives and that this aspect changed over the study period. The descriptions of the situation of some residents showed that certain changes in the social life on the ward had occurred as a result of the intervention PRACTICAL RELATION: A challenge for gerontology nurses to know and provide the best care and individualized treatment for each resident;"" it involves a holistic approach that helps residents in their aging process.

318,Changing clinical behavior by specifying guidelines,"The problems of getting people to act on evidence-based guidelines are widely recognized.1 A review of 41 systematic reviews found that the most promising approach was to use a variety of interventions, including audit and feedback, reminders and education. 1 The effective interventions have often involved complicated procedures and have always been complementary to the provision of guidelines. None of the studies used the simplest intervention—that is, changing the wording of the guidelines. We examine the importance of precise behavioral recommendations and suggest how some current policies could be improved.",0,1,
319,"Changing physician behavior: a training program to disseminate a new clinical pathway for hospital management of hip fractures in elderly patients in Lazio, Italy","Rationale and Objectives: Concerns about patient safety have increased interest in approaches to improve physician performance, but dissemination of clinical guidelines and conventional medical education have often failed. This study examined the impact of a training program based on experience reflection on the quality of care for hip fracture patients in Lazio, Italy. Methods: Five hospitals participated. The study consisted of the development of a clinical pathway, a preparatory phase and the pedagogical intervention itself, which included a course followed by monthly audits with reflection on practice, guided by the analysis of patient files. Data on the quality of care of patients with hip fractures were collected from the routine information system for the time before and after the intervention. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients who underwent surgery within 48 hours of admission (from 7% in 2006 to 26.4% in 2007) and a significant reduction in the mean length of hospital stay (from 18.8 to 16.4 days). . Some process indicators of treatment quality were high post-procedure, although non-recommended practices were still routinely used (e.g., urinary catheterization in 72.2% of patients). When comparing the hospitals, there were differences in the changes. CONCLUSION: An educational intervention that combined dissemination of a clinical pathway with external auditing focused on reflection on practice was effective in promoting behavioral change in physicians. The persistence of non-recommended practices and the differences between hospitals indicate that multiple factors affect performance and affect the effectiveness of interventions.",0,0,
320,Modifying human behavior to prevent disease: the importance of targeting automatic processes.,"Much of the global burden of disease is associated with behaviors—overeating, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity—that people recognize as unhealthy and yet continue to engage in, even when undesirable consequences occur. To date, interventions aimed at changing such behaviors have largely encouraged people to reflect on their behavior. These approaches are often ineffective, consistent with the observation that much human behavior is automatic and triggered by environmental stimuli, resulting in actions that are largely unaccompanied by conscious reflection. We propose that interventions targeting these automatic behavioral bases may be more effective. We discuss specific interventions and propose ways to determine if and how interventions targeting automatic processes can improve global disease prevention efforts.",0,1,
321,Rethinking: Bounded rationality and heuristic processes in exercise-related judgments and decisions.,"Theories currently used to understand, predict, and promote physical activity and exercise represent information-processing models of the mind. A fundamental assumption underpinning these theories is that human judgment and decision-making processes are rational. Therefore, interventions derived from these models aim to improve ""data input"" (e.g., to provide complete, accurate, and compelling information about health benefits) with the expectation that rational analysis of that data will result in the desired behavioral ""output."" will lead. Given the modest effectiveness of interventions based on these models, we designed two experiments that tested the validity of the rationality assumption, focusing specifically on exercise-related judgments and decisions. In Experiment 1, exercise ratings were modified by moving an arbitrary anchor, the presence of which should not affect these ratings. In Experiment 2, the mere addition of a third ""bait"" exercise option increased the preference between a targeted exercise session and an alternative. Together, these experiments demonstrate that important motivational variables, including perceived desirability of exercise, affective attitude, intention, affective prognosis, and exercise decisions, can be manipulated in a predictable direction without providing new relevant information, but only by targeting specific, well-known ones characterized heuristics. Therefore, these data provide evidence that the ""limited"" nature of human rationality is also manifested in exercise judgments and decisions. Researchers and exercise practitioners should consider incorporating heuristic processes into theoretical dual-process models of physical activity and exercise behavior.

322,Changing physician behavior to improve disease prevention,"Physicians often fail to provide the nationally recommended screening services for their patients. To address this, we reviewed selected literature on physician behavior change using the organizational construct of the transtheoretical “change readiness” model. This model suggests that behavior evolves through phases from pre-contemplation, through contemplation, to preparation, initiation, and maintenance of change. Traditional medical education can influence knowledge and beliefs, but rarely leads to behavioral change. However, motivational strategies such as practice feedback reports and influential peers can encourage level shifting. Successful interventions aimed at physicians preparing for change often use a practice systems approach that appeals not only to physicians but also to practice staff and patients. We illustrate how the change readiness model can guide the design and implementation of interventions and describe strategies used in a nationwide randomized controlled trial to improve primary care physician cancer prevention counseling and early detection. Partners for Prevention's multi-stage interventions include support from a health insurance carrier, a motivational videotape, a task-based practice manual, diagram flowcharts, patient activation forms, practice feedback reports, a designated prevention coordinator in each practice, and regular phone calls and office visits by project staff.",0,0,
323,Changing medical behavior: what helps?,"OBJECTIVES: There are various interventions for guideline implementation in clinical practice, but the impact of these interventions is generally unclear. We conducted a systematic review to identify effective ways to implement clinical research and clinical guidelines to change physician practice patterns in surgical and general practice. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of reviews. METHODS: We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed) for systematic reviews published in English that assessed the effectiveness of different implementation methods. Two reviewers independently assessed suitability for inclusion and methodological quality, and extracted relevant data. RESULTS: 14 reviews covering a wide range of interventions were identified. Intervention methods used include: audit and feedback, computer-based decision support systems, continuing medical education, financial incentives, local opinion leaders, marketing, passive information dissemination, patient-mediated interventions, reminders, and multiple interventions. Active approaches such as B. academic detailing, led to larger effects than traditional passive approaches. According to the results of 3 reviews, 71% of the studies included in these reviews showed a positive change in physician behavior when exposed to active educational methods and multifaceted interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Active forms of medical education and diverse interventions proved to be the most effective methods of translating guidelines into mainstream practice. In addition, active approaches to modifying physician performance have been shown to improve practice to a greater extent than traditional passive methods. Further primary research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in a surgical setting.",0,1,

The behavior of 165 physicians in 2 settings (suburban and urban) was examined. After collecting baseline clinical data, including systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a series of interventions were performed, including academic detailing. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 10.4% in suburban patients with cardiovascular disease in the intervention group (p=0.001) and by 10.5% in the extended intervention group (p=0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 1.11% (P=0.357) in the intervention group and by 5.13% (P<0.001) in the boosted intervention group. In urban hypertensive patients, systolic blood pressure decreased by 5.03% (P=0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 7.01% (P<0.001). Combining urban and suburban data, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 9.32% (p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure decreased 4.00% (p<0.001). Providing clinical outcomes to physicians, reviewing national guidelines, and setting expectations associated with modest practice system innovations can lead to significant, measurable clinical improvements.",0,0,

326,Chapter: A review of self-management support in (occupational) musculoskeletal pain disorders.,"The overview of self-management interventions for chronic diseases and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) presented in this chapter is narrative in nature. Individual qualitative and quantitative research studies as well as systematic reviews and other relevant reviews were considered. Four major databases were searched for relevant peer-reviewed literature published in the past 10 years. Publications prior to this period were included in the review if the work was considered seminal in terms of its contribution to the self-management knowledge base in the context of interest. The following terms were used as keywords and linked to Boolean operators: self-care, self-management, chronic illness, chronic illness, thematic patient education, patient-centred care, health behavior, back pain and musculoskeletal disorders. Because the focus of the review was on people of working age, the cutoffs used included English speakers and adults aged 15 to 64. Relevant gray literature and references from key authors in the field were also consulted. We did not formally assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The identified peer-reviewed studies were then examined for intervention components conceptually closely linked to self-management and involvement of chronic diseases, particularly MSDs, and otherwise excluded.

327,Chapter: Behavioral Economics and Treatment Engagement.,"Behavioral economics is a field that integrates concepts from psychology and economics to explain how individuals make decisions. In recent years, this area has been increasingly integrated into healthcare to promote a healthier lifestyle. Typically, participants receive monetary incentives when a target behavior or goal is objectively confirmed. In this chapter we describe this evidence-based treatment, commonly referred to as emergency management. This chapter is divided into four parts. The Background section provides an overview of the historical background of incentive-based interventions as used in the treatment of substance abuse. The Application of Incentive-Based Interventions to Medical Goals section describes the application of these interventions to other medical goals, such as: B. vaccinations, medical check-ups, diabetes monitoring, physical activity and weight-loss programs. The Basic Elements and Concepts Embedded in Incentive-Based Interventions section explains basic concepts and elements embedded in effective incentive-based interventions, and the final section discusses issues related to the use and dissemination of incentive programs.

328,Chapter: Escaping Cognitivism: Exercise as a Hedonic Experience.,"Determining their social relevance should be a strategic goal of movement psychology. However, progress toward this goal has been slower than anyone in the field would have liked. In this chapter we have argued that the failure to provide intervention methods that can reliably and meaningfully increase physical activity levels may in part be due to an overly narrow metatheoretical perspective. We have shown that all the major theories that have been in vogue in movement psychology in recent decades are derivatives of the same (cognitivist) metatheoretical framework. As such, they all share a key limitation, namely their relative disregard for the motivational properties of affective constructs such as core affect, moods, and emotions. Research over the last 15 years has shown that the old adage ""Exercise makes people feel better"" is wrong. Therefore, the central thrust of this chapter has been to underscore the urgent need for the field of movement psychology to transition into the post-cognitivist era.

329,Characteristics of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients in Swiss primary care,"BACKGROUND: Although a variety of treatment guidelines for patients with type 2 diabetes are available, the majority of patients do not achieve the recommended goals. Our aim was to characterize primary care type 2 diabetes patients in Switzerland who are missing HbA1c treatment goals and to uncover factors associated with poorly controlled HbA1c levels. METHODS: Cross-sectional study embedded in the cluster-randomized controlled Chronic Care for Diabetes study. Type 2 diabetes patients with at least one HbA1c measurement >/= 7.0% during the past year were recruited from Swiss primary care. Data assessment included diabetes-specific and general clinical measures, treatment factors, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: 326 type 2 diabetes patients from 30 primary care practices with a mean age of 67.1 +/- 10.6 years participated in the study. The patient findings for HbA1c were 7.7 +/- 1.3%, for systolic blood pressure 139.1 +/- 17.6 mmHg, for diastolic blood pressure 80.9 +/- 10.5 mmHg and for low density lipoprotein 2.7 +/- 1.1. 93.3% of the patients suffered from at least one comorbidity and were treated with 4.8 +/- 2.1 different drugs. No determining factor was significantly associated with HbA1c in the multiple analysis, but a significant clustering effect of general practitioners on HbA1c could be found. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients, no ""bullet points"" could be identified that could be easily addressed by any type of intervention. It is precisely in this subset of diabetic patients, who would benefit most from appropriate interventions to improve diabetes control, that there appears to be a complex interaction between diabetes control, comorbidities, primary care management, and patient health behaviors. So far, this interaction has only been insufficiently described and understood.",0,0,
330,Characteristics of successfully implemented telemedicine applications,"Background In recent years, interest in the use of telemedicine applications in clinical practice has increased. Significant effort has been invested in trials and trial services. Still, surprisingly few applications have progressed beyond the research and development phase. The aim of this study is to examine characteristics of successfully implemented telemedicine applications. Methods An extensive search of the telemedicine literature was conducted to identify relevant articles. After a defined selection process, a small number of articles describing features of successfully implemented telemedicine applications were identified. These articles were qualitatively analyzed using key Grounded Theory (GT) techniques, including densification and categorization. The analysis resulted in a description of characteristics considered important for a successful implementation of telemedicine. Then these features were discussed in the light of Science and Technology Studies (STS) and the concept of “social negotiation”. Findings Telemedicine applications introduced into routine practice are typically characterized by the following six characteristics: 1) problems in the provision of local services were clearly identified, 2) telemedicine was seen as an advantage, 3) telemedicine was seen as a solution to political and medical issues, 4) there was collaboration between project promoters and users, 5) issues of organizational and technological arrangements were addressed, and 6) the future operation of the service was considered. Conclusion Our results support research that argues that technologies are not fixed entities that move from invention through dissemination to routine use. Rather, it is the interaction of technical and social factors that produces a specific result. The success of a technology depends on how this interaction is handled in the implementation process.",0,0,
331,The survival of children in the third world: a functional analysis of oral rehydration therapy dissemination campaigns,"PIP: Behavior analysts performed a functional analysis of different intervention strategies used in 14 oral rehydration therapy (ORT) campaigns in 10 developing countries. The intervention researchers manipulated histories, behaviors, and/or outcomes to improve diarrhea management. The strategies used radio announcements, posters and brochures to encourage behavior change. Only 2 campaigns (Thailand and Egypt) limited their intervention to these precursors. Only 3 programs manipulated histories, behaviors and consequences. The 1983 campaign in Bangladesh included schooling for siblings and home visitation as part of vocational training and as a result offered incentives for trainers (US$30). The 1985 project in The Gambia used health workers to educate mothers at home about ORT and awarded lucky baby lottery prizes (rice, sugar and soap). The skills training component of the 1984 campaign in Honduras included one-on-one instruction. A radio course on breastfeeding, school lessons for siblings and an illustrated health manual. The consequences were games and prizes for radio shows, free calendars, keychains, t-shirts and a trip to Tegucigalpa. The only program limited to a training component was the South India campaign in 1976. The training included the training of nurses to instruct mothers in the management of diarrhea. An obstacle in all campaigns was that the ORT does not immediately improve externally diarrhea and vomiting. Those campaigns that included a qualification component were more effective than those that did not. Behavior analysts could contribute to ORT campaigns by developing simple and effective training programs and developing economical and effective mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of such campaigns.",0,0,

333,Screening and treatment practices of pediatric health care providers for childhood obesity,"This study evaluated physicians' screening and treatment practices for childhood obesity. A 26-question survey was delivered to pediatric providers in person or by mail, email or fax throughout Louisiana. Fifty-seven providers participated in the survey, the majority in primary care clinics. Five providers met at least four out of seven clinical guidelines, but no provider met all guidelines. While 88% of providers screened for obesity, 7% met guidelines for referring obese patients to weight management services. Six providers offered interventions that included all of the recommended components (ie, diet, physical activity, and behavioral counseling). One intervention met intensity guidelines (ie, > 25 hours for at least six months). Barriers to service delivery included a lack of reimbursement and poor family compliance. Solutions should be found to overcome treatment barriers to improve the delivery of health services to children with obesity.",0,0,
334,Childhood tonsillectomy: who is referred and what are the treatment options? Baseline findings from the North of England and Scotland Study of Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy in Children (NESSTAC),"BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomies are commonly performed, but there is variability in tonsillectomy rates. Clinicians use guidelines, but complex psychosocial influences on childhood tonsillectomy include anecdotal evidence of parental enthusiasm. Studies show that preferential treatment improves outcome. Despite the enthusiasm with which tonsillectomy is offered and sought, there is little evidence of its effectiveness. This led to a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy in children with recurrent sore throat. OBJECTIVE: To compare the characteristics of children enrolled in the randomized trial with those recruited into a parallel, non-randomized trial to determine trends in referral and patient preferences for treatment. DESIGN: Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial with parallel non-randomized preference study comparing surgery to medical management in children aged 4 to 15 years with recurrent sore throat related to five secondary ENT departments in northern England or western England Central Scotland. RESULTS: Centers assessed 1546 children"";"" 21% were not candidates for tonsillectomy. Among older children (8-15 years), girls were referred to secondary care significantly more frequently. Of 1015 eligible children, 268 (28.2%) consented to randomization, while 461 (45.4%) consented to the parallel non-randomized preference study, with a strong preference for tonsillectomy. Participants who reported hindering progress in school or who had more experience with persistent sore throats were more likely to seek a tonsillectomy. Referred boys were more likely than girls to choose medical treatment. Socioeconomic data showed no effect. CONCLUSION: Preference for tonsillectomy reflects educational impact and recent experience rather than age or socioeconomic status.",0,0,
335,Children in the taxi: a chance for paediatricians and emergency doctors to save lives?,"AIM: Child restraint devices (child seats, booster seats and seat belts) are effective in reducing the risk of injury"";"" however, a pattern of parental non-use or abuse of safety seats remains. The aim of this study was to assess parents' knowledge of and compliance with the National Highway and Traffic Association's safety seat guidelines in personal automobiles and taxi cabs of children presenting for emergency care. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-two caregivers of children (aged 2 weeks to 19 years) presenting for care in the pediatric emergency department of a city university hospital were approached to fill out a questionnaire administered by an interviewer, and 225 completed it . The questionnaire included knowledge, attitude and behavioral questions about protective equipment for children of different ages. RESULTS: Eleven (47.8%) of 23 children aged 1 year and younger reported frequently or always using child safety seats while traveling in private automobiles, compared to 8 (22.2%) of 36 children aged 12 and under 1 year or younger who reported using these in-car taxis (P < 0.05). Seventeen (85%) of 20 children older than 8 years reported frequently or always using seat belts in private cars versus 10 (41.7%) of 24 in taxis (P < 0.01). One hundred fifty-four (99.3%) of 155 subjects knew the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommended safety seat position for their child. Most parents believed in the effectiveness of child safety seats in preventing vehicle injuries and indicated that they would be more likely to use safety devices if they were given information about their use in the emergency room. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this survey shows that the use of safety seats in taxis is lower than in private cars and that this is more due to the inconvenience of transporting these seats to and from the taxi than to financial considerations or a lack of knowledge about their effectiveness. Strategies should be sought to increase the availability of child safety devices in taxis. The emergency room and pediatric office or clinic can be a place for an educational intervention for parents and caregivers about child safety.",0,0,

337,Cognitive performance and selective attention of children after recent community violence,"Research has shown robust relationships between community violence and psychopathology, but relatively little is known about how community violence can affect cognitive performance and attention. The present study estimates the effects of police-reported community violence on the performance of 359 urban children on a computer-assisted neuropsychological task using a fixed-effects quasi-experimental design. Living near a recent violent crime predicted faster but slightly less accurate task performance for the full sample, evolutionarily adaptive patterns of ""alert"" attention (ie, less attention to positive stimuli, more attention to negative stimuli) for children who reported weak trait anxiety and possibly maladaptive patterns of ""avoidant"" attention in very anxious children. These results suggest that community violence can directly affect children's cognitive performance, while also having differential (and possibly orthogonal) effects on attention delivery, depending on the children's level of biological behavioral risk. Implications for mental health and sociological research are discussed.",0,0,
338,Chiropractic care for pediatric and adolescent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Psychostimulants are the first line of therapy for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. Evidence suggests that up to 30% of stimulants prescribed do not show clinically significant results. In addition, many children and adolescents suffer from side effects of these drugs. As a result, parents are looking for alternative interventions for their children. Complementary and alternative medicine therapies for behavioral disorders such as AD/HD are on the rise, with as many as 68% of parents having sought help from alternative medicine professionals, including chiropractors. AIM: The review aims to answer the question of whether chiropractic care can reduce symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity in pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. METHODS: Electronic databases (Cochrane CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, Index to Chiropractic Literature) were searched for English-language chiropractic studies from early to July 2009 and AD /HS. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to selected studies. All randomized controlled trials were evaluated using the Jadad score and a checklist developed based on CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. RESULTS: The search yielded 58 citations, 22 of which were intervention studies. Of these, only three studies were identified for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD cohorts. The methodological quality was poor and none of the studies qualified based on the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for pediatric and adolescent AD/HD. The claim that chiropractic care improves pediatric and adolescent AD/HD is supported by little scientific evidence. In the interests of child and adolescent health, if chiropractic treatment for AD/HD is to continue, more rigorous scientific research must be conducted to study the efficacy and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment. Appropriately sized RCTs using clinically relevant outcomes and standardized measures to examine the effectiveness of chiropractic care compared to no treatment/placebo control or standard of care (pharmacological and psychosocial care) are needed to determine whether chiropractic care an effective alternative intervention for children and adolescents is AD/HD.",0,0,
339,Wise Choices in Headache Medicine: The American Headache Society's list of five things doctors and patients should question,"To raise awareness of tests and practices associated with poor quality treatment in headache medicine, the American Headache Society (AHS) joined the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely initiative. The AHS President has established an ad hoc AHS Choosing Wisely Working Group. The committee surveyed AHS members to create a list of candidates for the AHS ""Top 5"" list of low value treatments in headache medicine. Through a process of literature review and consensus, the final five-item list was selected. The draft recommendations went through several rounds of revision and a process of external review. The AHS Board of Directors approved the final list of the ""Five Things."" The five recommendations approved by the AHS board are: (1) do not conduct neuroimaging studies in patients with stable headaches who meet criteria for migraine; (2) do not perform computed tomography imaging for headache when magnetic resonance imaging is available, except in emergency situations; (3) do not recommend surgical deactivation of migraine trigger points outside of a clinical trial; (4) do not prescribe opioid or butalbital drugs as first-line treatment for recurrent headache disorders;"" and (5) do not recommend prolonged or frequent use of over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches. We recommend that headache medicine specialists and other physicians who evaluate and treat headache disorders should use this list when discussing treatment with patients.",0,0,
340,Choose Wisely: The American College of Rheumatology's top 5 list of things doctors and patients should question,"AIM: We wanted to develop a list of 5 tests, treatments, or services commonly used in rheumatology practice whose necessity or value should be questioned and discussed by physicians and patients. METHODS: We used a multi-step process that combined consensus methodology and literature reviews to arrive at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) top 5 list. Rheumatologists from different practices created items using the Delphi method. Items with high content agreement and perceived high prevalence became a survey of ACR members, who represent over 90% of the US rheumatology workforce. To increase the response rate, a nested random sample of 390 rheumatologists underwent more intensive survey follow-up. The samples were combined and weighting procedures applied to ensure generalizability. Articles with high ratings were subjected to a literature search. The final points were then selected and formulated by the task force. RESULTS: 105 unique articles were suggested and narrowed down to 22 articles during the Delphi rounds. A total of 1,052 rheumatologists (17% of those contacted) took part in the member-wide survey, while 33% took part in the nested random sample. The characteristics of the respondents were similar in both samples. Based on survey results and available scientific evidence, 5 items (relating to antinuclear antibodies, Lyme disease, magnetic resonance imaging, bone absorptiometry, and biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis) were selected for inclusion. CONCLUSIONS: The ACR Top 5 list is intended to encourage discussion between physicians and patients about rheumatology care practices that should be questioned and to support rheumatologists in delivering quality care.",0,0,
341,Choose Wisely: The American Society for Radiation Oncology's Top 5 List,"PURPOSE: To highlight 5 interventions patients should question as part of the Choosing Wisely campaign. This initiative, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation, encourages conversations between doctors and patients about treatments and tests that may be overused, unnecessary, or potentially harmful. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Potential items were initially compiled using an online survey. They were then evaluated and refined by a working group from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Clinical Affairs and Quality, Health Policy and Government Relations Councils. Literature reviews were conducted to support the recommendation and report and to provide references for each point. A final list of 5 items was then selected by the ASTRO Board of Directors. RESULTS: ASTRO's 5 recommendations for the Choosing Wisely campaign are as follows: (1) Do not start whole-breast radiotherapy as part of breast-conservation therapy in women aged >/= 50 with early-stage invasive breast cancer without a shorter course of radiation in treatment plans to consider""; (2) do not initiate management of low-risk prostate cancer without discussing active surveillance; (3) do not routinely use extended fractionation regimens (>10 fractions) for palliation of bone metastases; (4) do not do not routinely recommend proton beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer outside of a prospective clinical trial or registry;"" and (5) do not routinely use intensity-modulated radiation therapy to deliver whole-breast radiation therapy as part of breast-conservation therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The ASTRO list for the campaign "" Choosing Wisely” highlights radiation oncology interests rventions that should be discussed between physicians and patients before initiating treatment. These 5 elements offer opportunities to offer higher quality and less expensive care.",0,0,
342,Chronic care model and shared care in diabetes: randomized study of an electronic decision support system.,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a specialized telemedicine intervention to improve diabetes care using the Chronic Care Model (CCM). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS As part of the CCM, between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2003, 97 primary care physicians at 6 primary care practices in Rochester, MN, referred 639 patients to a local diabetes counselor. At first referral, physicians were centrally randomized to receive telemedicine intervention (specialist advice and evidence-based communications on medication management for cardiovascular risk) or no intervention, blinding outcome assessors and data analysts to group assignment. After each subsequent clinical encounter, endocrinologists reviewed a summary of the patient's electronic medical record and emailed treatment recommendations and supporting evidence to treating physicians. The control physicians received regular emails with general information on cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Outcome measures included diabetes care processes (diabetes test completion), outcomes (metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, estimated coronary artery disease risk), and patient costs (payer perspective). RESULTS During the intervention, 951 (70%) of the 1361 endocrinological reviews detected performance gaps and resulted in a report; GPs reported using 49% of messages in patient care. At a mean follow-up of 21 months, the intervention did not significantly improve metabolic outcomes or reduce the estimated risk of coronary artery disease compared to the control group (adjusted mean difference -1%; 95% confidence interval -19% to 17%). The intervention group emerged lower costs (P=0.02), but no diabetes-related costs. CONCLUSION Specialized telemedicine did not significantly increase the value of CCM in primary care.",0,1,
343,Health risk behaviors in chronic illness in people with a mental illness,"OBJECTIVE: In people with mental illness, modifiable health risk behaviors contribute significantly to increased morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. This study examined the prevalence of and interest in changing such behaviors among clients of community mental health services in Australia. METHOD: A telephone interview was conducted with clients from the Australian Community Psychiatric Service. Participants reported four unhealthy behaviors: tobacco smoking, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Participants were classified as Vulnerable based on Australia's national guidelines. At-risk participants were asked if they were considering improving their health-risk behaviors over the next month. The association between psychiatric diagnosis and risk, as well as interest in improving health risk behaviors, was examined. RESULTS: The risk prevalence was highest for insufficient vegetable consumption (78.3%), followed by insufficient fruit consumption (60%), smoking (50.7%), physical inactivity (46.8%), short-term alcohol risk (40.3% ) and chronic alcohol use risk (35.3%). A majority of at-risk participants considered improving their health-risk behaviors related to smoking, physical inactivity, and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake (65.1%, 71.1%, and 53.3%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic factors, no diagnostic categories were associated with risk for any behavior. Those diagnosed with depression were more interested in quitting smoking and increasing physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the diagnosis, a high prevalence of unhealthy behaviors was found in chronic diseases, with many participants expressing an interest in improving these behaviors. Such findings reinforce recommendations that preventive treatments that address patients' chronic disease risks are routinely provided by psychiatrists.

344,Competence network for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an intermittent, often chronic disease that primarily affects young people in their 20s and 30s, affecting their quality of life and socioeconomic performance. The triggering factors for the development of IBD have not been fully clarified: in addition to environmental factors, there are clear indications of other genetic factors that influence the risk of disease and the pattern of intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease. Pathophysiological findings lead to new therapeutic possibilities, which are carried out in large clinical studies with the significant participation of the CED competence network. The comprehensive structure of the network of university and non-university clinics and laboratories, the self-help organization DCCV and its vertical cooperation with general practitioners nationwide offers the opportunity to describe the diseases from a scientific and medical point of view at the same time. The IBD competence network thus provides the basis for the standardized integration of patient information, for the development of guidelines and the establishment of a quality management system, and thus leads to an improvement in scientific and clinical research.",0,0,
345,Cigarette smoking prevalence among adults living with HIV compared to the general adult population in the United States,"Background: The adverse health effects of cigarette smoking and HIV infection are synergistic. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of current cigarette smoking and smoking cessation rates between healthcare professionals living with HIV and adults in the general population. Design: Nationally representative cross-sectional surveys. Setting: United States. Patients: 4,217 adults living with HIV who participated in the Medical Monitoring Project and 27,731 US adults who participated in the 2009 National Health Interview Survey. Measurements: The main exposure was cigarette smoking. Outcome measures were weighted cigarette smoking prevalence and smoking cessation ratio (ratio of former smokers to sum of former and current smokers). to 45.1%) were current cigarette smokers, 20.3% (CI 18.6% to 22.1%) were ex-smokers, and 37.3% (CI 34.9% to 39.6%) had never smoked. Compared to the US adult population, in which an estimated 20.6% of adults smoked cigarettes in 2009, adults living with HIV smoked almost twice as often (adjusted prevalence difference, 17.0 percentage points [CI, 14.0 to 20.1 percentage points]) , but were less likely to quit smoking (rates, 32.4% vs. 51.7%). In adults living with HIV, factors independently associated with higher smoking prevalence were older age, non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black race, lower educational attainment, poverty, homelessness, incarceration, drug use, excessive alcohol use, depression and failure to achieve suppressed HIV viral load. Limitation: Cross-sectional design with some limitations in generalizability. Conclusion: Adults with HIV were more likely to smoke and less likely to quit smoking than the general adult population. Tobacco screening and tobacco cessation strategies are important considerations in routine HIV care.",0,0,

347,Civic obligation of the anorexic patient,"Involuntary attachment appears to be a rarely used intervention in anorexic patients, in part due to clinician uncertainty as to its applicability to this patient population. Unlike overtly suicidal patients, anorexic patients typically fail to express intention to harm themselves, even though their actions can result in serious harm. However, an examination of the wording of civil obligation statutes suggests that when anorexic patients' behavior endangers their lives, they are usually institutionalized below severe disability standards. This appears to be consistent with the practices of professionals treating anorexia and practices in other countries as well. Compulsory confinement should be used as a last resort when patients refuse voluntary hospitalization and their physical safety is at risk. In addition, the civil obligation should probably also be limited to circumstances in which a therapeutic benefit can be expected from hospitalization. Many critically ill anorexic patients will be unable to make treatment decisions for themselves, allowing involuntary feeding and other procedures to take place if necessary. Civic engagement is a tool that can legitimately be used in emergency situations involving anorexic patients.",0,0,
348,Classifications in the field of mental health,"For the first time in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9), the chapter on mental disorders included brief glossary definitions for each category. A number of attitudinal and policy changes at international and national levels, particularly the reorientation of mental health programs towards behavioral and psychosocial issues, came at an opportune time and had a positive impact on the development of proposals for the mental health chapter Problems Behavioral Disorders in the Tenth Revision (ICD-10). This in turn enabled WHO to carry out an intensive and comprehensive assessment of the international need for the classification of mental disorders and, where the situation was ambiguous, to organize field trials to provide the empirical data needed to solve the problem. The result is a set of compatible classifications of mental and behavioral disorders based on ICD-10. The first, created mainly as a reference tool for statistical purposes, is included in ICD-10 with brief glossary definitions, as was the case in ICD-9. Other versions are published for practicing clinicians (with expanded glossary definitions followed by diagnostic guidelines) for research purposes (with full definitions, diagnostic guidelines and diagnostic criteria)""; for use in providing mental health services;"" and for use in general health care (primary care). There will also be a multiaxial classification of mental disorders in children to identify the clinical syndrome, resulting disability and environmental factors.

349,Classroom-based cognitive-behavioral therapy to reduce symptoms of depression in high-risk adolescents: pragmatic randomized controlled cluster study,"OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of class-based cognitive behavioral therapy with attentional control and usual school services for adolescents at high risk of depression. DESIGN Three-arm, randomized, controlled, parallel cluster study. RECRUITMENT Eight secondary schools in the UK. PARTICIPANTS Adolescents (n=5030) aged 12-16 in grades 8-11. Age groups were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to cognitive behavioral therapy, attention control, or usual school offerings. Allocation was balanced according to school, year, number of pupils and classes, frequency of lessons and timetable. Participants were not blinded to treatment allocation. INTERVENTIONS Cognitive-behavioural therapy, attentional control, and usual school services offered to all eligible participants in the classroom. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes were collected through a self-completed questionnaire administered by the investigators. The primary endpoint was depression symptoms, which were assessed at 12 months using the short mood and emotion questionnaire in those who were at high risk of depression at baseline. Secondary outcomes were negative thinking, self-esteem, and anxiety. Analyzes were performed on a treatment intent basis and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. RESULTS: 1064 (21.2%) adolescents were identified as at high risk of depression: 392 in the class-based cognitive behavioral therapy arm, 374 in the attention control arm, and 298 in the usual school care arm. At 12 months, the adjusted means of the brief mood and feeling questionnaire did not differ for cognitive behavioral therapy versus attention control (-0.63, 95% confidence interval -1.85 to 0.58, p=0.41) or for cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual School offers (0.97, -0.20 to 2.15, P=0.12). CONCLUSION In adolescents with depressive symptoms, outcomes for attention control, usual school services, and cognitive behavioral therapy were similar. Classroom cognitive-behavioural therapy programs may result in increased self-esteem and reporting of depressive symptoms, but should not be undertaken without further evaluation and research.

DESIGN Single-blind, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomized, controlled study. SETTING 35 GP surgeries across southern England between October 2008 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS Patients aged 18+ with chronic dizziness (average duration > five years) not due to non-vestibular causes (confirmed by GP) and which could be aggravated by head movement (confirmed by patient). INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive routine medical care, booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation only, or booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation with telephone support. For the booklet approach, participants received self-management booklets with comprehensive advice on how to perform vestibular rehabilitation exercises at home daily for up to 12 weeks and how to use cognitive-behavioral techniques to promote positive beliefs and treatment adherence. Participants receiving telephone support were offered up to three short sessions of structured support from a vestibular therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Dizziness Symptom Scale--Short Form and Total Health Costs Associated with Dizziness per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY). RESULTS Of 337 randomized participants, 276 (82%) completed all clinical measures at the primary endpoint, 12 weeks, and 263 (78%) at one year of follow-up. We analyzed clinical efficacy by treatment intent using analysis of covariance to compare groups post-intervention, controlling for symptom scores at baseline. At 12 weeks, scores on the dizziness symptom scale in the telephone support group were not significantly different from those in the routine care group (adjusted mean difference -1.79 (95% confidence interval -3.69 to 0.11), p=0.064 ). After one year, both intervention groups improved significantly compared to routine care (telephone support -2.52 (-4.52 to -0.51), P = 0.014""; brochure only -2.43 (-4.27 to -0, Analysis of cost-effectiveness-acceptance curves showed that both interventions were very cost-effective; at very low QALY scores, the brochure-only approach was most likely to be cost-effective, but the added telephone support approach was most likely to be cost-effective at QALY -Values over £1,200 ($1,488; $1,932).Using the booklet approach with telephone support, five (three to 12) patients would need to be treated for one patient to report subjective improvement at one year.CONCLUSIONS Booklet-based vestibular rehabilitation in chronic vertigo is a simple and inexpensive means of improving patient-reported outcomes in primary care STUDY REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00732797.",0,0,

353,Clinical features associated with SSRI drug prescribing in adolescents with major unipolar depression,"Unipolar major depression (MD) clearly occurs during adolescence. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) UK recommends psychological therapies with concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are only prescribed in severe cases. Here we attempt to determine the extent and rationale for prescribing SSRIs in juvenile MD before entering a randomized clinical trial. SSRI prescription, along with its clinical characteristics, was determined in 465 adolescent patients with MD prior to receiving standardized psychological therapy as part of the Mood Improvement Through Psychoanalytic and Cognitive Therapies (IMPACT) clinical trial. A total of 88 (19%) were prescribed antidepressants prior to psychological treatment. Clinical correlations varied by gender: severity of depression in boys and self-harm in girls. Prescribing also differed between clinical research centers. Doctors consider the severity of depression in boys as an indicator for prescribing antidepressants. Self-harm in girls appears to be used as a prescribing aid, inconsistent with previous and current revised UK NICE guidelines.",0,0,

355,Clinical effectiveness of health visitor training in psychologically informed approaches to depression in postnatal women: pragmatic randomized cluster study in primary care,"OBJECTIVE To assess the benefits of two psychologically-based interventions by health visitors to postpartum women. DESIGN Prospective cluster study, randomized by primary care practice, with 18-month follow-up. SETTING 101 GP practices in Trent, England. PARTICIPANTS 2749 women were allocated to the intervention, 1335 to the control. INTERVENTION Health visitors (n = 89 63 clusters) were trained to recognize depressive symptoms at six to eight weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and clinical assessment, and they were also trained to use psychologically informed sessions on cognitive-behavioural or person-centered principles, one hour per week for eight weeks. Health visitors in the control group (n=49 38 clusters) provided usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Score > or = 12 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at six months. Secondary outcomes were the Edinburgh Mean Postnatal Depression Scale, Clinical Scores on Routine Assessment Outcome Measurement (CORE-OM), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), SF-12, and Parenting Stress Index Short Form (PSI-SF)- Scores at six, 12, 18 months. RESULTS 4084 eligible women consented and 595 women had a 6-week EPDS score > or = 12. Of these, 418 had EPDS scores available at 6 weeks and 6 months. At six months, 34% (93/271) of women in the intervention group and 46% (67/147) in the control group had an EPDS score > or = 12. The odds ratio for a score > or = 12 at six months was 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.97, P=0.036) for women in the intervention group compared to women in the control group. After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratio was 0.60 (0.38 to 0.95, P=0.028). At six months, 12.4% (234/1880) of all women in the intervention group and 16.7% (166/995) of all women in the control group had scores > or = 12 (0.67, 0.51 to 0.87 , P = 0.003) . The benefit for women in the intervention group with a 6-week EPDS score > or = 12 and for all women was maintained at 12 months postpartum. There was no differential utility for one of the psychological approaches versus the other. CONCLUSION Training health professionals to assess women, recognize symptoms of postnatal depression, and conduct psychologically informed sessions was clinically effective at six and twelve months postpartum compared to usual care.

356,Clinical global measures of dementia. Position paper of the International Working Group on Harmonization of Dementia Drug Guidelines,"The following is the report of the committee working on clinical global measures for anti-dementia drug guidelines. The concepts of global scales, the distinction between change and severity scales, advantages and disadvantages of structured interviews and the anchoring of change scores are discussed and selected existing clinical global scales are described. In addition, the committee evaluated the usefulness of global scales in clinical trials for antidementia drugs. There was consensus among the members of the working group on the following: (1) Clinical global scales are based on interviews"";"" In most cases, they contain information obtained from caregivers as well as directly from patients, but they can only rely on information from the data subject. (2) Clinicians' global assessments are intended to assess clinically meaningful changes based on a multidimensional clinical assessment and take into account the clinical heterogeneity of dementia by assessing at least cognition, behavior and functioning. (3) There are two distinct types of clinical global measures: (a) interview-based global clinician severity scales, which generally involve classification by stage or disease severity, and (b) interview-based global clinician change scales, which include global assessment assessments of clinical change. The committee could not reach a consensus on whether global scales should be required in Phase II and III clinical trials or whether other specific assessments such as well-designed activities of daily living, cognition and behavioral measures might, if used in appropriate combinations, replace the global ones as assessments of clinical significance.",0,0,
357,Clinical governance in the management of labor induction,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the dissemination of explicit guidelines, developed in consensus with stakeholders, for labor induction (IOL) processes leads to a reduction in variability in clinical practice. DESIGN: A prospective behavior change intervention study. STUDY LOCATION AND DURATION: The study was conducted between January 1 and August 31, 2002 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aga Khan University, Karachi. previously identified quality assessment indicators were measured. After collecting data from an initial 71 women (pre-intervention group), mutually agreed clinical practice guidelines were disseminated over a period of time among counselors, residents and nurses. These indicators were measured again on another 71 women (post-intervention group) to assess the extent of remaining nonconformities in these processes. RESULTS: After behavior-modifying interventions, deviations in doctor- and resident-dependent processes such as timely patient assessment by a specialist (72 vs. 1.4%, p-value <0.0001), documentation of the indication for the IOL (66.2 vs. 16.9 %, p-value < 0.0001), induction method for IOL (56.3 vs. 28.2%, p-value 0.0001) and calculation of Bishop score before IOL (38.0 vs. 4.2% , p-value < 0.0001) were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: The proliferation of explicit guidelines developed in consensus with stakeholders significantly reduces variability in clinical practice.

358,Clinical inertia: a common barrier to changing provider prescribing behavior,"BACKGROUND: A cross-sectional content analysis embedded in a randomized controlled trial was conducted to collect information about provider responses to computer alerts regarding guideline recommendations for patients with suboptimal hypertensive care. METHODS: Participants were providers treating 1,017 patients with uncontrolled hypertension on a single antihypertensive drug at Veterans Affairs primary care hospitals. All reasons for action or inaction were sorted into a frame to explain differences in guideline adaptation. RESULTS: The 184 negative responses from the provider to computer alerts included explanations for not changing the patient's treatment"";"" 76 Responses to the warnings were positive, meaning the provider would change the antihypertensive regimen. The negative responses were categorized as follows: inertia in practice (66%), lack of agreement with specific guidelines (5%), patient-related factors (17%), environmental factors (10%), and lack of knowledge (2%). . Most of the 135 providers classified as indolent of practice said, ""Continue current medication and I will discuss it at next visit."" The median number of days to next visit was 45 days (interquartile range, 29 to 78 days).

In the past two decades, these improvements have not occurred as extensively as expected, as many researchers working in clinical forms of clinical research have failed to address these fundamental scientific challenges related to data, taxonomy, and reasoning. Instead, researchers applied quantitative ""models"" drawn from non-clinical fields, focusing on hard data, randomized trials, Bayes' theorem, quantitative decision analysis, and psychometric strategies for clinometric measurement. Consequently, the key challenges of clinical assessment remain widely available for basic scientific research by investigative clinicians.",0,0,
360,Handbook for developing guidelines for clinical practice: a quality-oriented approach to translating evidence into action,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. A well-designed guideline promotes quality by reducing variability in healthcare, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective or potentially harmful interventions. Despite a plethora of published guidelines, the methodology is often poorly defined and varies widely within and between organizations. PURPOSE: This manual describes the principles and practices successfully applied by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery to produce quality-driven, evidence-based guidelines that use an efficient and transparent methodology for action-ready recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. The development process, which makes it possible to go from conception to completion in 12 months, emphasizes a logical sequence of key actions supported by supporting text, evidence profiles and recommendation grades that link actions to evidence. CONCLUSIONS: As clinical practice guidelines become more important as a key measure of quality healthcare, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians need to understand what guidelines are - and are not - and how best to use them to improve care. The information in this guide is intended to help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.",0,0,
361,Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis Media with Effusion (Update),"AIM: This update of a 2004 guideline co-developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians provides evidence-based recommendations for treating otitis media with effusion (OME). , defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear with no signs or symptoms of an acute ear infection. Changes from the previous guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews and 49 randomized controlled trials, a greater emphasis on patient education and shared decision-making, a new algorithm to clarify the Action Statement Relationships and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of OME. PURPOSE: The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify opportunities for quality improvement in the management of OME and to provide explicit and actionable recommendations for implementing these opportunities in clinical practice. In particular, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to the developmental consequences of OME, and educate clinicians and patients about the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefit of medical therapy (e.g., steroids , antihistamines, decongestants) ). Additional goals relate to OME monitoring, hearing and speech assessment, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months to 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying diseases predisposing to OME and its sequelae. The guidance is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and treat children with OME and applies to all situations where OME is identified, monitored, or treated. However, this guideline does not apply to patients over the age of 12. ACTIONS: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should have tympanometry in children with suspected OME in whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should treat the child with OME who is not at risk with vigilant waiting 3 months from the date of onset of effusion (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should discourage the use of intranasal or systemic steroids to treat OME; (6) should discourage the use of systemic antibiotics to treat OME; and (7) should discourage the use of antihistamines, decongestants, or both to treat OME by parents of infants with OME who do not undergo newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure hearing is normal when OME resolves and to rule out underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine whether a child with OME is at increased risk of language, language, or learning difficulties due to middle ear effusion due to sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) children at risk for OME should be screened at the time of diagnosis of a risk disease and 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed at risk before that time); (4) Children should not be routinely screened for OME who do not pose a risk and do not have symptoms that could be due to OME, such as: (5) should educate children with OME and their families about the natural history of OME, the need for follow-up care, and the possible consequences; (6) should receive an age-appropriate hearing test if OME lasts 3 months or more OR for OME of any duration in a child at risk; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) children with chronic OME should be reassessed at 3 to 6 month intervals until the effusion is resolved, significant hearing loss is noted, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when performing surgery for OME in a child /=4 years;” and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when treating a child with OME.",0,0,
362,Clinical Practice Guideline: Tinnitus,"AIM: Tinnitus is the perception of sounds without an external source. More than 50 million people in the United States have reported suffering from tinnitus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus and its potentially significant impact on quality of life, there are no evidence-based, multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist physicians in management. The focus of this guideline is on tinnitus that is both annoying and persistent (lasting 6 months or more), often affecting the patient's quality of life. The guideline is intended for all clinicians, including non-physicians, involved in the management of patients with tinnitus. The patient target population is restricted to adults (18 years and older) with persistent and bothersome primary tinnitus. PURPOSE: The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for physicians treating patients with tinnitus. This guideline provides physicians with a logical framework to improve patient care and mitigate the personal and social impact of persistent, bothersome tinnitus. It will discuss the evaluation of patients with tinnitus, including the selection and timing of diagnostic tests and referral to a specialist to identify potential underlying treatable pathologies. It then focuses on the assessment and management of patients with persistent primary tinnitus, with recommendations to guide the assessment and measurement of the impact of tinnitus and to determine the most appropriate interventions to improve symptoms and quality of life in tinnitus sufferers. ACTION: The development group strongly recommended that physicians differentiate patients with bothersome tinnitus from those with non-disruptive tinnitus. The development group strongly recommended that head and neck imaging should not be performed in patients with tinnitus, particularly to assess tinnitus that is not localized to one ear, is not pulsatile, and is not associated with focal neurological abnormalities or an asymmetric hearing loss. The panel made the following recommendations: clinicians should (a) conduct a targeted history and physical examination at the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected primary tinnitus to identify disorders that, if promptly recognized and treated, may relieve tinnitus; (b) obtain a prompt, comprehensive audiological evaluation in patients with tinnitus that is unilateral, persistent (>/= 6 months), or associated with hearing problems; (c) distinguish patients with bothersome tinnitus of recent onset from those with ongoing symptoms (>/= 6 months) to prioritize interventions and facilitate discussion of natural history and follow-up; (d) educate patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus about treatment strategies; (e) recommend hearing aid evaluation for patients who have persistent, bothersome tinnitus associated with documented hearing loss; and (f) recommend cognitive behavioral therapy to patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus against (a) antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, or intratympanic drugs for routine treatment of Patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; (b) ginkgo biloba, melatonin, zinc or other dietary supplements for the treatment of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus; and (c) transcranial magnetic stimulation for the routine management of patients with persistent, bothersome tinnitus. The development group provided the following options: ""Physicians can have (a) an initial comprehensive audiological assessment in patients presenting with tinnitus (regardless of laterality, duration, or perceived hearing status);"" and (b) patients with persistent tinnitus a Recommend sound therapy, annoying tinnitus The development group made no recommendation on the effect of acupuncture in patients with persistent, annoying tinnitus.",0,0,
363,Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children,"OBJECTIVE: Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children under the age of 15. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure, performed with or without an adenoidectomy, in which the tonsil, including its capsule, is completely removed by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it can indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, particularly in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children aged 1 to 18 years who are being considered for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in all settings dealing with children aged 1 to 18 who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide physicians with evidence-based guidance for identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, to emphasize the need for assessment and intervention in special patient groups, to improve the counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlighting treatment options for patients with modifying factors; and reducing inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care. RESULTS: The panel made a strong recommendation that physicians give a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone intravenously to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel issued a strong recommendation against clinicians who routinely give or prescribe perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infections if fewer than 7 episodes have occurred in the past year, or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years, or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years"" ; (2) Evaluation of the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet the criteria in Statement 2 for modifying factors that may nevertheless favor tonsillectomy, including but not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and History of adenitis or peritonsillar abscess; (3) interviewing caregivers of children with sleep disordered breathing and tonsillar hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavior problems; (4) advising caregivers about the tonsillect tomie as a means of improving health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also suffer from tonsillar hypertrophy and sl eep-disordered breathing; (5) advising caregivers that sleep breathing disorders may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further treatment; (6) advocating post-tonsillectomy pain management and educating caregivers on the importance of pain management and re-evaluation;"" and (7) clinicians performing tonsillectomy should assess their rate of primary and secondary post-tonsillectomy bleeding at least annually. The panel offered options for recommending tonsillectomy for recurrent strep throat with a frequency of at least 7 episodes per year for the past year, or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years, or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years, with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3 °C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.",0,0,
364,Clinical practice guideline: ventilation tubes in children,"OBJECTIVE: Tube insertion is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most commonly used for persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tube placement, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for all clinicians involved in the management of children aged 6 months to 12 years with ventilation tubes or who are being considered for ventilation tubes in any care setting as an intervention for otitis media of any type. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide physicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group discussed in detail indications for tube placement, perioperative management, the provision of indwelling tubes in children, and the outcome of tympanic tube surgery. Given the lack of currently published guidelines on surgical indications, the group focused on situations where tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly in relation to shared decision-making and the care of children with existing tubes. ACTIONS: The development group strongly recommended that physicians prescribe only topical antibiotic ear drops without oral antibiotics for children with uncomplicated acute tympanic tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should refrain from tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) less than 3 months; (2) Clinicians should have an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or more (chronic OME) or prior to surgery if a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tubes; (3) Physicians should offer bilateral ventilation tubes for 3 months or more to children with bilateral OME (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) Clinicians should reassess children with chronic OME who have not received ventilation tubes at 3 to 6 month intervals until the effusion is resolved, significant hearing loss is noted, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected ; (5) Clinicians should refrain from tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in both ears at the time of evaluation for tube candidacy; (6) Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tubes to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of evaluation for tube candidacy; (7) Clinicians should determine whether a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk of language, language, or learning difficulties due to otitis media because of sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) In the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes about the expected duration of tube function, the recommended follow-up schedule, and the detection of complications; (9) Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) in children with ventilation tubes in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms likely to develop OME, including but not limited to balance disorders, poor school performance, behavior problems, ear problems, or reduced quality of life, and (2) clinicians may, in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is not likely to resolve quickly, such as caused by a type B tympanogram (flat) or persistent effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME), insert a tympanostomy cannula.",0,0,
365,Clinical practice guidelines for severe Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Although severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread, serious, and costly public health problem, few practice guidelines exist to assist physicians in managing this condition. METHODS: A search of English-language medical databases was conducted from 1996 to the present for articles related to the management of AD. This review focused on studies that included patients with severe disease. The studies were evaluated considering the subjects, the study design, the analysis and the results. The recommendations were based on the best available evidence. RESULTS: Severe AD can be reliably defined and diagnosed using measures of cognition, function, behavior and global staging. Specific assessments would also include the health, safety and health of the caregiver. Disease specific treatment would include treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms begins with nonpharmacological behavioral and environmental approaches. Severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis that are potentially dangerous to the patient, caregiver, and others in the environment can be treated with atypical antipsychotics, bearing in mind their increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. All pharmacological approaches require careful monitoring and regular periodic reassessments to determine if continued treatment is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines for the management of severe AD have the potential to improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Further randomized controlled trials specifically targeting this phase of the disease are still urgently needed.",0,0,
366,Clinical practice guidelines for improving shared decision-making about the use of assistive devices in home care: a pilot intervention study,"This study examines whether clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the introduction of assistive devices (ADs) in home care improve shared decision-making about the use of ADs and alter their social-cognitive correlates. The data was collected in an intervention study with a quasi-experimental design. Questionnaires were collected from 116 home nurses and home caregivers and their 140 clients with disabilities. Significant differences between the intervention and control groups showed that the implementation of guidelines improved the self-reported practice of home care workers and home care workers: the number of intervention methods used increased and the methods were used with increased intensity. In both the intervention group and the control group, nurses' attitudes towards introducing ADs into a shared decision-making process decreased over time. Client reports of caregivers' practice showed marginal agreement with the reports of the caregivers themselves. The complexity of the guideline and a significant time commitment were cited as the main barriers to involving clients in shared decision-making through the experimental guideline. Nonetheless, CPG promises shared decision-making between formal caregivers and people with disabilities in the community regarding AD use. The results indicate that these guiding principles can structure the communication between caregiver and client and support caregivers in promoting the self-determination of clients in dealing with their disability.",0,0,
367,Clinical Practice Update: Expert Report on Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) are currently being evaluated or in clinical use in the United States. EBTs are well positioned to fill an important gap in the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases. The purpose of this expert report is to keep gastroenterologists informed about these therapies and to provide practical advice on how to integrate them into clinical practice. METHODS: The evidence reviewed in this work is a distillation of a comprehensive search of multiple English-language databases and a manual review of relevant publications (including systematic reviews and conference abstracts). Best practice advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have failed to reduce or maintain weight loss through lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. They can also be used as a bridge to allow for unrelated procedures that cannot be performed due to weight restrictions (e.g. orthopedic surgery, organ transplantation). Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes nutritional interventions, exercise therapy, and behavior modifications in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should screen all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive assessment for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should prospectively follow patients to capture the impact of the EBT program on weight and weight-related comorbidities and any associated adverse events. Poor responders should be identified and offered detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Advice 6: Clinicians beginning to integrate EBTs into their clinical practice should have a thorough understanding of the indications, contraindications, risks, benefits, and outcomes of individual EBTs, as well as a working knowledge of the risks and benefits of alternative therapies related to obesity. Best Practice Advice 7: Institutions should establish specific policies, applied consistently across disciplines, to grant privileges in EBTs that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skills a clinician must achieve before earning privileges to conduct them procedure received.",0,0,
368,Deviations in clinical practice with reduced fetal movements,"BACKGROUND: Reduced fetal movements imply high-risk pregnancy. This condition occurs in a significant proportion of pregnancies, but the quality of information and clinical care varies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All maternity wards in Eastern Norway and Bergen registered all consultations for reduced fetal movements as part of the international collaborative project “Fetal Movement Intervention Assessment” (Femina). From 23,933 births, 1200 pregnancies were examined. In 1043 pregnancies, the mother had spontaneously expressed concern about ""restricted fetal movements"" and these were included in the analyses. Results are presented with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Asphyxia, death, growth restriction or preterm birth occurred in 19.6% 22.6%) of cases ranging between 9.1% and 26.5% between units. Standard procedures varied widely."" Sonography was used in 39.0% to 98.6% and Doppler in 4.5% to 74.6% of cases. There was a correlation between the results and the methods used. Women who waited 24 hours with reduced or absent movements before contacting health services were at increased risk. Forty-seven percent (42-52%) of those with missing movements exhibited such risky behavior. INTERPRETATION: There is a need for quality improvement in the information provided to pregnant women and in the clinical management of affected pregnancies. This could have great health benefits. We propose new guidelines for information and management.",0,0,
369,clinical practice. Later orthodontic complications caused by risk factors observed in early life,"Primary preventive oral health strategies are an essential public health priority. Pediatricians have frequent contact with families during routine checkups during the child's early years and are in an ideal and unique position to advise families on the prevention of oral disease in their children. Primary prevention is always recommended in very young children to promote positive outcomes in childhood and later adulthood. The knowledge that pediatricians acquire about orofacial growth can improve the implementation and ultimate success of a prevention program. Given the widespread lack of orthodontic knowledge among pediatricians, this article describes the most common and characteristic symptoms that are common in the early stages of child development and are easily recognizable by clinicians. Because of its multifactorial origin, it is difficult to define preventative strategies to prevent malocclusion. However, there are some recognized behaviors that should be discouraged to allow for ideal craniofacial development and some that require early orthodontist referral. The following disorders are easily diagnosed by the pediatrician or parent and represent conditions where early intervention may be warranted to prevent possible future orofacial dysfunction: differential sucking habits persisting beyond age 3, mouth breathing, and significant deviations from established tooth eruption standards. It is recommended that early referral to a pediatric dentist or orthodontist is indicated if any of these conditions occur. In general, measures to prevent deformities should be based on providing good incentives to promote normal growth and development of the face and eliminating possible disorders that can affect these processes.",0,0,
370,Clinical memories associated with echocardiographic reports from patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction increase beta-blocker use: a randomized trial.,"Background – Although beta-blockers are known to prolong survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, they are often underused. We hypothesized that a reminder attached to the echocardiography report would increase the use of beta-blockers in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. METHODS AND RESULTS—We randomized 1546 consecutive patients with <45% left ventricular ejection fraction detected on echocardiography in 1 of 3 laboratories to beta-blocker use reminder or no reminder. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they died within 30 days of randomization (n = 89), were off medication through the Veterans Affairs system at 30 days (n = 180), or in > 1 laboratory (n = 6) underwent echocardiography. The primary endpoint was the prescription of an oral beta-blocker between 1 and 9 months after randomization. The mean age of the 1271 included patients was 69 years; 60% had a history of heart failure and 51% were receiving beta-blocker treatment at the time of echocardiography. More patients randomized to reminder received a subsequent beta-blocker prescription (74%, 458 of 621) compared to those randomized to no reminder (66%, 428 of 650; P=0.002). The effect of the reminder was not significantly different for subgroups based on patient status (inpatient versus outpatient) or prior beta-blocker use. Conclusions - A reminder attached to the echocardiography report enhanced the use of beta-blockers in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function.",1,1,
371,Clinical research on interventional pain management techniques: the clinician's perspective,"Interventional pain management techniques are considered for patients whose pain proves refractory to conventional management. According to the guidelines of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the highest level of evidence for the efficacy and safety of a treatment is generated in high-quality randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. A randomized controlled trial is defined as an experiment to determine the impact of an intervention on the natural history of the disease, meaning that the comparison group should receive a placebo, which in the case of interventional pain management techniques is a sham intervention. The systematic overview summarizes the results of the available information in a structured way. When randomized controlled trials are available, observational studies are often discarded. As new information about a treatment becomes available, the perceived value can change and thus determine the survival time of clinical evidence. This survival time does not differ when based on randomized or non-randomized studies. The inclusion criteria are an important part of the randomized controlled trial and are intended to test a treatment in a homogeneous patient population. Because interventional pain management techniques are primarily used to treat spinal pain, it must be emphasized that there is no gold standard for diagnosis. This lack of validated standard diagnostic procedures is the reason for different patient selection criteria, which makes the interpretation of the different randomized controlled trials and the meta-analyses very difficult. In addition, the translation of randomized controlled trials with carefully selected patient populations to daily practice is a major problem. Randomized controlled trials of interventional pain management techniques often prove underpowered, due to the difficulty in motivating patients and referring physicians to participate in a trial where there is a 50% chance of receiving a placebo/sham treatment for intractable pain obtain. In addition, the validity of sham interventions as a reflection of the natural course of the disease is questioned. It is concluded that any new technique should prove at least as effective as the best available treatment option, which offers the opportunity to compare two groups both receiving active treatment. The reference treatment may be a pharmacological or a rehabilitation (cognitive behavior) program, in which case blinding becomes a problem. It has been shown that large observational studies with a cohort or case-control design do not systematically overestimate the magnitude of associations between exposure and outcome compared to the results of randomized controlled trials. There is an urgent need for guidelines on conducting prospective cohort studies, which should be designed to confirm or refute the anecdotal findings from retrospective studies.",0,0,

DESIGN Prospective multicenter cohort. SETTING Five centers in Auckland, New Zealand; Adelaide, Australia; Manchester and London, United Kingdom;' and Cork, Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS 3572 ""healthy"" nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy from a large international study"";"" Pregnancy outcome data were available for 3529 (99%). KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT Preeclampsia, defined as ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, on at least two occasions four hours apart after 20 weeks gestation but before the onset of labor or after delivery, either with proteinuria or a multisystem complication. Pre-eclampsia was defined as women with pre-eclampsia who were delivered before 37 (+0) weeks gestation. In the stepwise logistic regression, women without preeclampsia were the comparison group. RESULTS Of the 3529 women, 186 (5.3%) developed preeclampsia, including 47 (1.3%) premature preeclampsia. Clinical risk factors in the 14th-16th gestation were age, mean arterial blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), family history of preeclampsia, family history of coronary artery disease, maternal birth weight, and vaginal bleeding for at least five days. Factors associated with reduced risk were a previous single miscarriage with the same partner that lasted at least 12 months before becoming pregnant, high fruit consumption, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption in the first trimester. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.71 when validated internally. Adding uterine artery Doppler indices did not improve performance (internal validation AUC 0.71). A framework for referral to a specialist was developed based on a model-generated probability of preeclampsia of at least 15% or an abnormal uterine artery Doppler waveform in a subgroup of women with single risk factors. Nine percent of nulliparae would be referred to a specialist, of which 21 percent would develop preeclampsia. The relative risk of developing preeclampsia and premature preeclampsia in women referred to a specialist compared to standard of care was 5.5 and 12.2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ability to predict preeclampsia in healthy nulliparous women based on clinical phenotype is modest and requires external validation in other populations. If validated, it could provide a personalized clinical risk profile for nulliparous women, to which biomarkers could be added. Test registration ACTRN12607000551493.",0,0,
374,Cluster-randomized controlled trial of tailored interventions to improve management of female urinary tract infections and sore throat.,"Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of tailored interventions to implement guidelines for female UTI and sore throat Design: Unblinded, cluster-randomized pretest-post-test study Setting: 142 general practices in Norway Participants: 72 practices received interventions to implement guidelines for UTI and 70 practices received sore throat policy implementation interventions that served as controls for each other. 59 practices in the urinary tract infections group and 61 practices in the sore throat group completed the study. Outcomes were measured at 16,939 sore throat consultations and 9,887 urinary tract infection consultations. Interventions: Interventions were developed to address identified barriers to implementation of the guidelines. Key components of the tailored interventions included patient educational materials, computer-assisted decision-making and reminders, an increase in the fee for telephone consultations, and interactive courses for GPs and practice assistants antibiotics. Women with UTI symptoms in the intervention group were 5.1% less likely to have a laboratory test ordered. No significant differences between the groups were found for the other endpoints. Large differences were found between the included practices in rates of antibiotic prescribing, use of laboratory tests and telephone consultations, and in the magnitude of change for all three outcome measures Practice switch",0,1,

GPs are increasingly expected to meet the needs of patients concerned about their risk of inherited breast cancer, but may lack the skills or confidence to apply complex treatment guidelines. We have developed an evidence-based, multi-faceted intervention designed to promote confidence and skills in this area. objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in improving primary care physicians' confidence in the treatment of patients concerned about genetic risk of breast cancer. methods. Design. Cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting. General practices in the Grampian region of Scotland. Subjects. GPs and the patients they referred for genetic counseling for breast cancer risk. main target parameter. GP self-reported confidence in four genetics-related activities; referral rates of patients at increased genetic risk; and referred patients' understanding of cancer risk factors. Results. No statistically significant differences were observed between the intervention and control arms in the primary or secondary endpoints. A possible effect of the intervention on the proportion of referred patients with an increased risk could not be ruled out. Only a small proportion of the intervention physicians took part in the training, knew the software or used it in practice. Conclusions. No convincing evidence of the intervention's effectiveness was found, likely due to barriers to its use in routine practice.",0,1,
376,"Cluster-randomized study of a multi-level, evidence-based quality improvement approach to adapting VA patient-aligned care teams to the needs of female veterans","Background The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has undertaken a major initiative to transform care through the introduction of Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). Based on the concept of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), PACT aims to improve access, continuity, coordination and completeness through team-based care that is patient-focused and patient-centered. However, how VA should adapt PACT to meet the needs of special populations such as female veterans (WVs) was not considered in the initial implementation guidelines. WVsÂ¡Â¯ numeric minority in VA healthcare facilities (approximately 7Â¨C8% of users) creates logistical challenges for the delivery of gender-biased comprehensive care. The primary objective of this study is to test an evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) approach to tailor PACT to the needs of WVs, to include comprehensive primary care services and gender-sensitive care in gender-sensitive settings, thereby accelerating the achievement of PACT Principles for Women (WomenÂ¡Â¯ s Health (WH)-PACT). Methods/Design EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multi-level research-clinic partnership that involves senior organizational leaders and local quality improvement (QI) teams in adapting and implementing new models of care in the context of prior evidence and local practice conditions, with researchers providing technical support , formative feedback and practice facilitation. In a 12-site, cluster-randomized study, we will assess the performance of the WH-PACT model through patient, provider, staff, and practice surveys and analyzes of secondary administrative and chart-based data. We will examine the impact of receiving WH-PACT care on the quality of chronic disease treatment and prevention, health status, patient satisfaction and experience of treatment, provider experience, utilization, and cost. Using mixed methods, we will assess the pre- and post-practice contexts; document the EBQI activities carried out in the participating institutions and their relationship to providers/staff and team actions/attitudes; document WH-PACT implementation;' and explore barriers/intermediaries to EBQI-assisted WH-PACT implementation through a combination of semi-structured interviews and monthly formative progress reports and administrative data. Discussion The lack of gender-sensitive comprehensive care has shown implications for the technical quality and assessment of care at WVs and may contribute to decisions to continue use or to seek treatment elsewhere under the US Affordable Care Act. We envision that EBQI's tailored PACT implementation can improve the experience and quality of care at many levels.",0,1,
377,Cluster-randomized studies for pharmaceutical practice research,"Introduction Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are now the gold standard in health services research, including pharmacy-based interventions. Studies on behavior, epidemiology, lifestyle changes, educational programs, and healthcare delivery models leverage the power of cluster-randomized analysis. Methodology The key property of CRTs is the unit of randomization (cluster), which may differ from the unit of analysis (individual). The sample size of subjects, and ideally the number of clusters, is determined by the relationship between between-cluster and within-cluster variability. The correlation between participants recruited from the same cluster is called the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In general, more clusters with smaller ICC values result in smaller sample sizes. When selecting clusters, stratification prior to randomization can be helpful to reduce imbalances between study arms. Participant recruitment methods may differ from other types of randomized trials because blinding of a behavioral intervention is not always possible. When to use CRTs can provide results relevant to ""real world"" decisions. CRTs are often used in non-therapeutic intervention studies (eg, change in practice guidelines). The advantages of the CRT design in pharmaceutical research lie in the avoidance of contamination and the generalizability of the results. In this manuscript, a large CRT that investigated cooperative management of hypertension between physicians and pharmacists is used as a CRT example. The study, titled ""Collaboration Among Pharmacists and medics To Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION)"" was conducted in the US in general practitioner offices for hypertensive patients. Limitations Limitations of the CRT design include the need for large numbers of clusters, high cost, increased training, increased monitoring, and statistical complexity.",0,0,
378,"Cluster-randomized, controlled study on computer-aided decision support for the selection of long-term antithrombotic therapy after acute ischemic stroke.","Background: The identification of appropriate long-term antithrombotic therapy after acute ischemic stroke is a challenging area in which computer-based decision support can help. Aim: To evaluate the impact on prescribing practice of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) that provided patient-specific estimates of expected ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular event rates under each potential antithrombotic therapy. Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We recruited patients presenting for an initial evaluation for ischemic stroke or TIA symptoms, excluding patients with poor prognosis or serious contraindications to anticoagulation. After observation of routine prescribing practice (6 months) at each hospital, centers were randomized to either control (observed routine practice) or intervention (practice observed while the CDSS provided patient-specific information) for 6 months. We compared the risk reduction (estimated by the CDSS) in ischemic and hemorrhagic vascular events achieved by long-term antithrombotic therapy between control and intervention centers and the proportions of subjects prescribed the optimal therapy identified by the CDSS. RESULTS: Sixteen hospitals recruited 1,952 subjects. When the CDSS provided information, the mean relative risk reduction achieved by prescribing increased by 2.7 percent units (95% CI -0.3 to 5.7) and the odds ratio for prescribing optimal therapy was 1, 32 (0.83 to 1.80). Approximately 55% (5/9) of the physicians believed that the CDSS had influenced their prescription. Conclusions: Cluster-randomized studies offer excellent framework for the evaluation of novel clinical management methods. Our CDSS was feasible and acceptable to clinicians, but did not have a significant impact on prescribing practice for antithrombotic drugs after acute ischemic stroke.",1,1,
379,COACH Study: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction by Nurses/Community Health Workers in Urban Health Centers: Rationale and Design,"BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of risk-reduction practices remains inadequate. This paper describes the rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the comparative efficacy of a comprehensive cardiovascular disease risk reduction program conducted by nurse (NP)/healthcare worker (CHW) teams to improved usual care in improving the proportion of patients in urban community health centers meeting national guidelines recommended targets for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c and appropriate medication prescription. METHODS: The COACH (Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health) study is a randomized controlled trial in which patients at accredited community health centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: extensive intensive management of CVD risk factors for one year by an NP / CHW team or an extended control group for usual care. RESULTS: A total of 3899 patients were evaluated for eligibility and 525 randomized. The groups were similar at baseline for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, with the exception of statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a novel amalgam of tiered interdisciplinary strategies for transferring highly effective therapies to low-income, government-funded health centers that care for patients who bear a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors.

381,Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Because psychological approaches are likely to provide sustained benefits without the risk of tolerance or side effects associated with pharmacological approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) is now widely recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia. Purpose: To determine the effectiveness of CBT-i on diary measurements of nocturnal sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. Data Sources: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and PubMed Clinical Queries from inception through March 31, 2015, supplemented by manual screening. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of face-to-face, multimodal CBT-i versus inactive comparators on nocturnal sleep in adults with chronic insomnia. Studies on insomnia comorbid with medical, sleep or psychiatric disorders were excluded. Data Extraction: Study characteristics, quality and data were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Main outcome measures were sleep onset latency (SOL), waking up after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE%). Data Synthesis: Among 292 citations and 91 reviewed full-text articles, 20 studies (1162 participants [64% female; mean age 56 years]) were included. Approaches to CBT-i included at least 3 of the following: cognitive therapy, stimulus control, sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, and relaxation. At the time of post-treatment, SOL improved by 19.03 (95% CI, 14.12 to 23.93) minutes, WASO by 26.00 (CI, 15.48 to 36.52) minutes, TST by 7.61 ( CI, -0.51 to 15.74) minutes and SE% improved by 9.91% (CI, 8.09% to 11.73%). Changes seemed to be maintained at later dates. No side effects have been reported. Limitation: Narrow inclusion criteria limited applicability to patients with comorbid insomnia and other sleep problems, and the accuracy of estimates at later time points was less clear.

384,Cognitive Debiasing 2: Obstacles and Strategies to Change,"In a companion article, we suggested that cognitive debiasing is a skill essential to developing sound clinical reasoning to reduce the incidence of diagnostic failure. We reviewed the origins of cognitive bias and some proposed mechanisms of how debiasing processes might work. In this paper, we first outline a general scheme of how cognitive changes occur and the limitations that may apply. We review a variety of individual factors, many of which are themselves biases that can impede change. We then examine the main strategies developed in the social sciences and medicine to achieve cognitive and affective debiasing, including the important concept of function forcing. The abundance and variety of approaches that exist in the literature and in individual clinical areas highlight the difficulties inherent in achieving cognitive change and also the need for such interventions. Ongoing cognitive debiasing is arguably the most important trait of the critical thinker and well-calibrated mind. We outline three groups of proposed interventions for the future: educational strategies, workplace strategies, and coercive functions. We emphasize the importance of environmental and contextual influences on the quality of individual decision-making and the need to consider factors known to affect decision-maker calibration. We also emphasize the importance of introducing these concepts and the concomitant development of critical thinking training in undergraduate medical education.",0,1,

387,"Cognitive behavioral therapy, imipramine, or their combination for panic disorder","Context Panic disorder (PD) can be treated with medication, psychosocial interventions, or both, but relative and combined efficacy has not been assessed unbiasedly. Aim To assess whether drug and psychosocial therapies for Parkinson's are each more effective than placebo, whether one treatment is more effective than the other, and whether combination therapy is more effective than either therapy alone. Design and Framework Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study conducted from May 1991 to April 1998 in 4 anxiety research clinics. Patients A total of 312 patients with Parkinson's were included in the analysis. Interventions Patients were randomized to treatment with imipramine up to 300 mg/day only (n=83); cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) only (n=77); placebo only (n=24); CBT plus imipramine (n=65) or CBT plus placebo (n=63). Patients were treated weekly for 3 months (acute phase); Responders were then followed monthly for 6 months (maintenance phase) and then followed up for 6 months after treatment discontinuation. Main Outcome Measures Treatment response based on Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) by treatment group Results Both imipramine and CBT were significantly superior to placebo in the acute treatment phase as determined by the PDSS Intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis, 45.8%, 48.7%, and 21.7%; p=0.05 and p=0.03, respectively, but were not significantly different for the CGI (48 .2%, 53.9%, and 37.5%, respectively) After 6 months of maintenance therapy, imipramine and CBT were significantly more effective than placebo r both the PDSS (response rates, 37.8%, 39.5%, and 13.0%, respectively ; P=0.02 for both) and CGI (37.8%, 42.1%, and 13.0%, respectively). Among the responders, imipramine produced a higher quality response. The acute response rate for the combined treatment was 60.3% for the PDSS and 64.1% for the CGI; none differed significantly from the other groups. The 6-month maintenance response rate for the combination therapy was 57.1% for the PDSS (p=0.04 versus CBT alone and p=0.03 versus imipramine alone) and 56.3% for the CGI (p=0 .03 versus imipramine alone), but not significantly better than CBT plus placebo in either analysis. Six months after stopping treatment, the CGI response rates in the ITT analysis were 41.0% for CBT plus placebo, 31.9% for CBT alone, 19.7% for imipramine alone, 13% for placebo, and 26.3% for CBT in combination with imipramine.

388,Collaborative care for depressed patients with chronic illness: a randomized study in Puerto Rico,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether a collaborative care model for depression would improve clinical and functional outcomes for depressed patients with chronic systemic illnesses in primary care practices in Puerto Rico. METHODS: A total of 179 primary care patients with major depression and chronic systemic diseases were randomly assigned to collaborative or usual care. The collaborative care intervention included enhanced collaboration between physicians, mental health specialists, and care managers, coupled with depression-specific treatment guidelines, patient education, and follow-up. In usual care, the study staff informed the patient and the healthcare provider about the diagnosis and encouraged the patients to discuss treatment options with their healthcare provider. Depression severity was assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist"";"" Social functioning was assessed using the 36-item short form. RESULTS: Compared to usual care, cooperative care significantly reduced depressive symptoms and improved social functioning in the six months after randomization. The integration of collaborative care into primary care practices has significantly increased the use of mental health services by depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care improved clinical symptoms and functional status in depressed patients with co-existing chronic systemic diseases who received anti-depressant treatment in primary care offices in Puerto Rico. These findings underscore the promise of the collaborative care model in strengthening the relationship between mental health and primary care services in Puerto Rico.",0,0,

RESULTS: In patients with major depression, the intervention group demonstrated greater adherence than the usual care control group for 90 days or longer (75.5% vs. 50.0%; p<0.01) on appropriate dosing of antidepressant quality of care, for depression as good to excellent (93.0% vs. 75.0%; P<0.03) and rated antidepressants as somewhat to very helpful (88.1% vs. 63.3%; P<0.03). 0.01) 74% of the intervention patients with major depression showed an improvement of 50% or more on the Symptom Checklist-90 Depressive Symptom Scale compared to 43.8% of the control group (P < 0.01), and the intervention patients also showed a significant improvement greater decrease in depression severity over time compared to controls (P < 0.004) In patients with mild depression, the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater adherence versus the control group to appropriate dosing of antidepressants for 90 days or more (79.7 % vs. 40.3%; P<0.001) and were more likely to rate antidepressants as somewhat helpful to very helpful (81.8% vs. 61.4%; P<0.02). However, no significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in the percentage of patients who were satisfied with the treatment of their depression (94.4% vs. 89.3%), in the percentage in which the depressive symptoms improved 50% or more decreases, or decreases in depressive symptoms over time of cooperative treatment by primary care physician and a consultant psychiatrist, intensive patient education, and monitoring of continuous antidepressant replenishment improved adherence in patients with major and mild depression, improved the Treatment satisfaction and led to more favorable depression outcomes in patients with major but not minor depression.",0,0,
390,Collaborating to Improve Childhood Obesity Practice in Rural Clinics: the Healthy Eating Active Living Telehealth Community of Practice (HEALTH COP),"This study evaluated the effects of participation in a virtual quality improvement (QI) learning network on adherence to clinical guidelines for childhood obesity prevention in rural clinics. A total of 7 primary care clinics in rural California that are part of the TeleHealth Community of Practice for Healthy Eating and Active Living and 288 children treated at these clinics for good child care participated in this prospective, before-and-after, observational study. Clinics participated in a virtual QI learning network over 9 months to implement best practices and share improvement strategies. After the intervention, documentation of weight determination and counseling increased significantly. Children cared for by physicians who directed delivery of the intervention at their clinic showed significant improvements in diet and physical activity. Virtual QI learning networks in geographically dispersed clinics can significantly improve clinician compliance with childhood obesity guidelines and increase access to recommended care for rural and underserved children.",0,0,
391,Collective action to implement: a realistic assessment of organizational collaboration in healthcare,"Background Increasingly, it is suggested that translation gaps could be eliminated or reduced by bringing research users and producers closer together, a theory that is largely untested. This paper reports on a national study to fill a gap in the evidence on the conditions, processes and outcomes related to collaboration and implementation. Methods A realistic longitudinal evaluation using several case studies with qualitative methods was carried out with three Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research in Care (England). Data was collected over four rounds of theory development, refinement, and testing. Over 200 participants were involved in semi-structured interviews, non-participant observation of events and meetings, and stakeholder engagement. A combined inductive and deductive data analysis process focused on refinement of the proposition and iterative testing over rounds of data collection. Findings The quality of existing relationships between colleges and local health services and views on whether implementation was a collaborative act created a path dependency. Where implementation was perceived as remote from the service and lacking in organizational links, this led to a focus on knowledge production and transfer rather than co-production. Collaborative architectures were counterproductive because they did not facilitate connectivity and had emphasized professional and epistemic boundaries. More distributed leadership was associated with greater potential for engagement. Creating cross-border roles was the most visible investment in implementation, and credible individuals in these roles led to cross-border work, facilitation and direct impact. The gap between academia and practice played out strongly as a context for motivation to engage, as ¡Â®whatÂ¡Â¯s in it for me¡Â¯ led to different levels of engagement along a collaborative-collaborative continuum. Learning within and between collaborations was patchy, depending on the emphasis placed on assessment. Conclusions These collaborations did not emerge from a vacuum and they took time to learn and develop. Her life cycle began with her position on Collaboration, Knowledge and Execution. More effective attempts at collective action at implementation could be determined by the conscious alignment of a range of characteristics, including underlying relationships, vision, values, structure and processes, and views on how to work together and implement.",0,0,
392,"Admission to colonoscopy in high-risk individuals with a family history of colorectal neoplasia: A multicenter, randomized study of tailored advice versus standard information","BACKGROUND: Colonoscopic screening is recommended for first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) or colorectal adenomatous polyps (CAP) before age 60. This has the potential to reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality, but uptake is currently insufficient. METHODS: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of standard information versus a nurse-led tailored intervention aimed at promoting uptake of colonoscopy screening by siblings of CRC or CAP patients. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Digestive surgeons and gastroenterologists recruited index patients who developed CRC or CAP before age 60. All index patients received standard screening information for their siblings according to current guidelines. Centrally computerized randomization of index patients resulted in all their siblings being assigned to the same group, intervention, or control. The tailored intervention initially targeted the index patient to help them relay information to their siblings. The nurse then provided the siblings with tailored information based on their responses to a self-questionnaire examining health behaviors and derived from psychosocial prevention models. The siblings then received a personalized information brochure to hand over to their general practitioner. The primary endpoint was the rate of documented colonoscopies performed on siblings within 1 year of the index patient's diagnosis. The intent-to-treat analysis included siblings who refused to participate in the study. Statistical analysis was adjusted for intra-familial correlation. RESULTS: A total of 304 siblings of 125 index patients were included: 160 in the intervention group and 144 in the control group. The uptake of a colonoscopy among siblings was 56.3% in the intervention group and 35.4% in the control group (p = 0.0027). The respective rates after eliminating rejections were 69.2% and 37.0% (P<0.0001). More lesions were detected in the intervention group (1 invasive cancer and 11 advanced adenomas versus 5 advanced adenomas; P=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a nurse-led, tailored intervention designed to promote uptake of colonoscopy screening by siblings of patients diagnosed with CRC or CAP before age 60. Such tailored interventions, also involving physicians, should help reduce CRC-related mortality.",0,0,
393,Combined diet and physical activity promotion programs for the prevention of type 2 diabetes among those at increased risk: A systematic review for the Community Prevention Services Task Force,"Background: Studies have shown the effectiveness of programs that promote a strict diet and physical activity in reducing the incidence of diabetes and improving glycemic scores in adults at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Purpose: To evaluate diet and physical activity promotion programs for people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes, mainly to reduce the risk of diabetes and to reduce body weight and blood glucose levels. Data sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CAB Abstracts, Global Health and Ovid Health-STAR from 1991 to February 27, 2015, without language restriction. Study selection: 8 investigators reviewed articles for single group or comparative studies of combined diet and physical activity programs of at least 2 sessions for at least 3 months in participants at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Data extraction: 7 investigators extracted data on study design, participant, intervention and outcome descriptions; and Outcomes and assessed study quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: 53 studies (30 on diet and physical activity programs vs. usual care, 13 on more intense vs. less intense programs, and 13 on individual programs) evaluated 66 programs. Compared with usual care, diet and exercise programs reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes (risk ratio [RR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.66]) (16 studies), decreased body weight (net change , -2.2% [ CI, -2.9% to -1.4%]) (24 studies) and fasting blood glucose level (net change, -0.12 mmol/L [-2.2 mg/dL] [ CI, -0.20 to -0.05 mmol/L {-3.6 to -0.9 mg/dL}]) (17 studies) and improved other cardiometabolic risk factors. The evidence for clinical events was limited. More intensive programs were more effective. Limitations: Large differences in diet and physical activity promotion programs limited the identification of the characteristics most relevant to efficacy. Evidence on clinical outcomes and in children was sparse. Conclusion: Combined diet and physical activity programs are effective in reducing the incidence of diabetes and improving cardiometabolic risk factors in at-risk individuals. More intensive programs are more effective.",0,0,
394,Combination of intensive medical care counseling or brief counseling by the general practitioner with varenicline for smoking cessation in primary care: study protocol of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: The combination of behavioral support and pharmacotherapy is most effective for smoking cessation and is recommended in clinical guidelines. Although GP support for smoking cessation can be effective, the dissemination of clinical practice guidelines and educational efforts have not resulted in GPs routinely providing smoking cessation advice. Intensive counseling by the practice nurse could contribute to better smoking cessation rates in primary care. However, the effectiveness of intensive counseling by a practicing nurse compared to usual care by a general practitioner in combination with varenicline is not yet known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial was conducted comparing: (a) intensive individual counseling by a nurse in the office and (b) brief counseling by a general practitioner”; both groups received open-label varenicline for 12 weeks. At least 272 adult daily smokers were recruited and treated in their routine primary care settings. The primary outcome was defined as prolonged abstinence from weeks 9 to 26, validated biochemically by exhaled carbon monoxide. Data were analyzed in a blinded, intention-to-treat fashion, and participants with missing data on their smoking status at follow-up were counted as smokers. Secondary endpoints included: one-year prolonged abstinence, short-term incremental cost-effectiveness, medication adherence, and baseline predictors of successful smoking cessation. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to provide scientific evidence for the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and possible mechanisms of action of intensive care counseling combined with varenicline in real-world settings. This paper explains the methodology of the study and discusses the pragmatic and/or explanatory design aspects. STUDY REGISTRATION: Dutch Study Register NTR3067.",0,0,
395,Comfort First: an evaluation of a procedural pain management program for children with cancer,"BACKGROUND: The Comfort First (CFP) program provides children and their caregivers with early procedural pain management to reduce procedural pain and distress. This study evaluated whether the CFP was meeting its objectives and effectively implementing the Royal Australasian College of Physicians' guidelines for pediatric pain management. Methods: The study was conducted as a single site cross-sectional audit. One hundred and thirty-five patients (mean age 7.7 years) treated at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Children's Cancer Center Day Oncology Unit were followed. Procedural aspects related to the treatment room, caregiver and staff behavior, child distress, and use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were recorded using an audit tool developed for the study. RESULTS: The treatment room was regularly quiet and prepared before the child entered. The mean procedure time was 8 minutes. The mean waiting time for the procedure was 54 minutes. At least one nurse was usually present during the procedure. Comfort First (CF) clinicians were more likely to be present at procedures involving a significantly distressed child. Caregivers, nurses, and CF clinicians generally exhibited comfort-promoting behavior. Local anesthetic was used regularly. Non-pharmacological supports were used frequently, especially distraction. Patients younger than 8 years were significantly more likely to receive non-pharmacological support and to have a nurse and CF doctor present. Age was a significant predictor of stress, with higher stress rates in younger children. CONCLUSIONS: The CFP was found to be effective in implementing procedural pain guidelines. Regular audits are recommended to ensure compliance with pain management standards.",0,0,
396,Coping with challenging behaviors: a cluster-randomized controlled trial of the effects of a multidisciplinary care program on challenging behaviors in dementia,"OBJECTIVES: The Grip on Challenging Behavior care program was developed using current guidelines and models for dealing with challenging behavior in dementia in nursing homes. It was hypothesized that use of the nursing program would result in a decrease in challenging behavior and prescription of psychotropic drugs without an increase in the use of restraints. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted using a step wedge design to implement the care program and assess the effects. Challenging behavior and psychoactive medication assessments were conducted at all participating units every 4 months, followed by the initiation of the care program in a group of 3 to 4 units. A total of 6 time measurements took place in 20 months. SETTING: Seventeen dementia specialty wards from various nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 659 residents of special dementia wards. All residents with dementia on the ward were included. Units were assigned by random assignment software to 1 of 5 groups with different starting points for the implementation of the care program. INTERVENTION: A care program consisting of various assessment procedures and tools that ensure a multidisciplinary approach and structure the process of dealing with challenging behavior in dementia. MEASUREMENTS: Challenging behavior was measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Research assistants (blind to the ward's intervention status) interviewed nurses on the wards about challenging behaviors. Data on psychoactive drugs and coercive measures were extracted from patient records. Results: A total of 2292 assessments were carried out on 659 residents (1126 control measurements, 1166 intervention measurements). The group of residents remaining in the intervention condition compared to the group in the control condition differed significantly in CMAI change scores between consecutive assessments [-2.4 CMAI scores, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.3 to - 0.6]. No significant effects were found for the control-to-intervention group compared to the group that remained in the control group (0.0 CMAI points, 95% CI -2.3 to 2.4). Significant effects were seen in 5 of the 12 neuropsychiatric inventory entries and in the use of antipsychotics (odds ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.80) and antidepressants (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.44). -0.94) found. No effect on the use of fixations was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The Grip on Challenging Behavior program was able to reduce some forms of challenging behavior and the use of psychotropic drugs.",0,0,
397,Communicating with paediatricians: developing the practice of social work in primary care,"While social work models of interdisciplinary collaboration suggest that communication is important, the research literature on social worker-physician collaboration rarely considers working with pediatricians or practices outside of the hospital setting. A cross-sectional survey was sent to a stratified random sample of social workers to determine their satisfaction with communication with pediatricians. The study found that social workers in health care facilities were more satisfied than those in mental health facilities. The implications of this finding for the development of co-localized, collaborative models of care are discussed.",0,0,
398,"Communication style and exercise compliance in physical therapy (CONNECT): a cluster-randomized controlled trial testing a theory-based intervention to improve patients with chronic low back pain's adherence to physical therapist recommendations: rationale, design, and methods of the study","BACKGROUND: Physical activity and exercise therapy are among the accepted clinical rehabilitation guidelines and are recommended self-management strategies for chronic low back pain. However, many back pain patients do not follow the recommendations of their physiotherapist. Poor patient adherence can reduce the effectiveness of counseling and home rehabilitation exercises. According to self-determination theory, support from healthcare professionals may promote patient self-motivation and greater long-term behavioral persistence (eg, compliance with physical therapist recommendations). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of an intervention designed to improve autonomy-supportive communication by physical therapists on adherence to physical activity and exercise therapy recommendations in patients with low back pain. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be a single-blind, randomized, controlled cluster study. Outpatient physiotherapy centers (N = 12) in Dublin, Ireland (population = 1.25 million) will be randomly assigned to either the experimental or control arm using a computer-generated algorithm. Physiotherapists in the experimental arm (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) participate in an eight-hour communication training session. The training includes handouts, workbooks, video examples, role plays and discussions aimed at teaching physical therapists how to communicate in a way that promotes autonomous patient motivation. Physiotherapists in the control arm of the waiting list (two hospitals and four primary care clinics) do not receive this training. Participants (N=292) with chronic low back pain will complete the assessments at baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after their first physical therapy appointment. Primary outcomes include adherence to physical therapy recommendations, as well as back pain, function, and well-being. Participants will be blinded to treatment assignment as they will not be told if their physical therapist has received the communication training. Outcome raters are also blinded. We will use linear mixed modeling to test between-arm differences in both means and rates of change of outcome variables. We will use structural equation models to study the change process including assumed mediation effects. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to test the effect of a self-determination theory-based communication skills training program for physical therapists on the adherence of their patients with back pain to rehabilitation recommendations.",0,0,
399,Community occupational therapy for elderly patients with dementia and their caregivers: cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of community-based occupational therapy versus usual care in elderly patients with dementia and their caregivers from a societal perspective. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness study alongside a single-blind randomized controlled trial. SETTING Memory clinic, day clinic of a geriatric ward and participants' homes. Patients 135 patients aged > or = 65 years with mild to moderate dementia living in the community and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION 10 sessions of occupational therapy over five weeks, including cognitive and behavioral interventions to train patients on the use of tools to compensate for cognitive decline and caregivers on coping behaviors and supervision. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as the difference in mean total cost of care per successful treatment (ie, a combined patient and caregiver outcome measure of clinically relevant improvement on process, performance, and competency scales) three months after randomization. Bootstrap methods for determining confidence intervals for these measures. RESULTS The procedure cost 1183 euros (£848, $1738) (95% confidence interval 1128 euros (808 pounds sterling, $1657) to 1239 euros (888 pounds sterling, $1820)) per patient per general practitioner at three months. Visits to GPs and hospital doctors cost the same in both groups, but the median total costs were 1748 euros (£1279, $2621) lower in the intervention group, with the largest cost savings occurring in informal care. There was a significant difference in the proportions of successful treatments of 36% at three months. The number required for successful treatment at three months was 2.8 (2.7 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS Community occupational therapy intervention for patients with dementia and their caregivers is successful and cost-effective, particularly with regard to informal care.",0,0,
400,Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) Trial: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction by Nurses/Community Health Workers in Urban Health Centers,"BACKGROUND: Despite well-publicized guidelines on appropriate management of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, implementation of risk-reducing practices remains inadequate. This report describes the results of a randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, administered by teams of nurses/physicians (NP/CHW), compared to enhanced common care (EUC) to improve lipid and blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and patient perceptions of the quality of their chronic disease care among patients in urban health centers. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 525 patients with documented cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertension and LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, or HbA1c levels that exceeded goals set by national guidelines were randomized to NP/CHW ( n= 261) or EUC (n=264) groups. The NP/CHW intervention included aggressive pharmacological management and tailored educational and behavioral counseling for lifestyle modification and problem solving to remove barriers to compliance and control. Compared to EUC, patients in the NP/CHW group had a significantly greater 12-month improvement in total cholesterol (difference 19.7 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol (difference 15.9 mg/dl), triglycerides (difference 16.3 mg/dl), systolic blood pressure (difference 6.2 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (difference 3.1 mm Hg), HbA1c (difference 0.5%) and perception of the quality of their treatment for chronic diseases (difference 1 ,2 points). CONCLUSIONS: An intervention delivered by an NP/CHW team using individualized treatment regimens based on treat-to-target algorithms can be an effective approach to assess risk factor status and chronic disease treatment perceptions in high-risk patients to improve.",0,0,
401,Community-based care for the management of type 2 diabetes: an evidence-based analysis,"UNRATIFIED: In June 2008, the Medical Advisory Secretariat began work on the Diabetes Strategy Evidence Project, an evidence-based review of the literature on strategies for successful management and treatment of diabetes. This project arose when the Department of Health and Long-Term Care's Health Systems Strategy Division subsequently asked the Secretariat to provide an evidence platform for the Department's newly published diabetes strategy. The Secretariat identified five key areas where evidence was needed. Evidence-based analyzes were produced for each of these five areas: insulin pumps, behavioral interventions, bariatric surgery, home telemonitoring, and community-based care. For each area, where appropriate, an economic analysis was carried out, which is described in a separate report.

CLINICAL NEEDS: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Diabetes (ie, diabetes mellitus) is a common chronic metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce or use insulin effectively. The majority (90%) of diabetic patients have type 2 diabetes. (1) Based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), intensive glycemic and blood pressure control significantly reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetics. While many studies have documented that patients often fail to meet glycemic control goals set by national and international guidelines, factors related to glycemic control are less well studied, including healthcare provider(s). Multidisciplinary treatment approaches can be particularly important in diabetes management. According to Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) guidelines, the diabetes health care team should be multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Currently, the core team of diabetes health care in Ontario consists of at least one general practitioner and/or diabetes specialist and diabetes educator (Registered Nursing and Registered Nutritionist). Strengthening the role of healthcare professionals in diabetes care and collaborating with physicians may represent a more cost-effective option for diabetes management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined multidisciplinary care programs, but these have either been limited to a specific component of multidisciplinary care (e.g., intensified educational programs) or have been implemented as part of a broader disease management program, not all of which have been multidisciplinary in nature. Most reviews also do not clearly define the intervention(s) of interest, making evaluation of such multidisciplinary community programs difficult. EVIDENCE-BASED METHODS OF ANALYSIS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the evidence for the effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary outpatient care provided by at least one registered nurse, one registered dietitian and one physician (primary care and/or specialist) for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care is carried out? [Hereafter referred to as Model 1] What is the evidence of the effectiveness of specialized multidisciplinary community care provided by at least one pharmacist and one general practitioner for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care? [Hereinafter referred to as Model 2] INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language complete reports published between 1 January 2000 and 28 September 2008, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses, adult patients with type 2 diabetes (>/= 18 years). ) Total sample size >/= 30 Describe specialized multidisciplinary outpatient care, defined as outpatient care provided by at least two health care disciplines (at least one of which must be a specialist in diabetes) with integrated communication between care providers.

Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer, and for studies that met the eligibility criteria met, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also searched for additional relevant studies not identified by the search. Articles with unknown authority were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then with a panel of epidemiologists until consensus was reached. The quality of the evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE methodology. Given the high clinical heterogeneity of the items that met the inclusion criteria, specific models of specialized multidisciplinary community care were examined based on models of care currently supported in Ontario, as well as models of care that have been widely reported in the literature. Proposals from one session of the Expert Advisory Panel on January 21, 2009. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2,116 unique citations from which 22 RCT studies and nine published systematic reviews were identified that met the selection criteria. Of these, five studies focused on care provided by at least one nurse, a dietician and a physician (primary care and/or specialist) as a model of care (Model 1; see Table ES 1), while three studies focused on care provided by at least one nurse Pharmacist and general practitioner (Model 2;” see Table ES 2). Based on moderate-quality evidence, specialized multidisciplinary community care model 2 has demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant 1.0% reduction in HbA1c compared to usual care. However, this model of SBP is uncertain compared to usual care, based on evidence from very low-quality Specialized multidisciplinary community care Model 2 has demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both HbA1c of 1.05% (based on high-quality evidence) and SBP of 7.13 mmHg (based on moderate-quality evidence) compared to usual care. For either model, the evidence does not suggest a preferred setting of care (ie, primary care vs. outpatient hospital treatment). t-clinic vs. community clinic).

402,Community-based knowledge transfer and exchange: Supporting community-based organizations in linking research with action,"Background Community-based organizations (CBOs) are important actors in health systems and are increasingly being called upon to use research to underpin their advocacy, programming, and service delivery efforts. CBOs are increasingly turning to community-based research (CBR) given their participatory focus and emphasis on linking research and action. To further facilitate the use of research evidence by CBOs, we have developed a community-based knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) strategy that helps CBOs more effectively link research evidence to action. We developed the strategy by ""outlining the primary characteristics of CBOs and why they are important stakeholders in health systems"", describing the concepts and methodologies for CBR and CTE, and comparing CBR's efforts to link research findings to actions against which Discussion We find CBR to be particularly effective at developing a framework for community-based KTE that builds on both the strengths of CBR and existing KTE frameworks Foster a climate for the use of research evidence and the production of relevant research evidence on CBOs through community participation However, CBOs are not always as engaged in activities to link research results to larger-scale action or to evaluate these efforts, therefore focuses our strategy for community-based KTE on: an e extended model of 'connection and exchange' (ie producers and users of researchers asking and answering questions together); a greater emphasis on producing and disseminating systematic reviews that address topics of interest to CBOs; Development of a large-scale evidence service consisting of both 'push' and 'pull' facilitation efforts that highlight actionable messages from community-relevant systematic reviews in a user-friendly manner;' and rigorous assessments of efforts to link research evidence to action . Summary This type of strategy can better facilitate and continually refine the use of research evidence for CBO advocacy, program planning, and service delivery efforts through ongoing assessments of its impact.",0,0,

Despite high rates of impairment, there are no randomized controlled trials examining the feasibility and effectiveness of mental health interventions in former child soldiers. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of a community-based intervention targeting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in formerly abducted individuals. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized controlled trial of the recruitment of 85 ex-child soldiers with PTSD from a population-based survey of 1113 Northern Ugandans aged 12-25 years conducted between November 2007 and October 2009 in IDP camps. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: narrative exposure therapy (n = 29), an academic catch-up program with elements of supportive counseling (n = 28), or a waiting list (n = 28). PTSD symptoms and trauma-related guilt were measured using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The respective sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used to assess depression and suicide risk, and a locally adjusted scale was used to measure perceived stigma. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, and associated impairments were assessed before treatment and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the intervention. Intervention treatments were delivered in 8 sessions by trained local lay therapists directly in the communities. Main outcome measure Change in PTSD severity grade assessed over 1 year after treatment. Secondary endpoints were depression symptoms, suicidal ideation severity, guilt, and perceived stigma. Results PTSD symptom severity (range 0-148) was significantly more improved in the narrative exposure therapy group than in the academic catch-up group (mean difference in change, ∅ 14.06 [95% confidence interval, ∅ 27.19 to ∅ 0.92 ]) and wait-and-see list (mean difference in change, ?13.04 [95% confidence interval, ?26.79 to 0.72]) groups. Contrast analyzes of the temporal treatment interaction of the mixed effects model of change in PTSD symptoms over time demonstrated a superiority of narrative exposure therapy compared to academic catch-up (F1,234.1 = 5.21, P = 0.02) and waiting times . Listing (F1,228.3 = 5.28, P = 0.02). Narrative exposure therapy produced a larger within-treatment effect size (Cohen d=1.80) than academic catch-up (d=0.83) and waitlist (d=0.81). Conclusion In former Ugandan child soldiers, short-term trauma-focused treatment resulted in greater reductions in PTSD symptoms compared to an academic catch-up program including supportive counseling or a waiting list.",0,0,
405,"Communitywide cardiovascular disease prevention programs and health outcomes in a rural county, 1970-2010","Significance Few comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction programs, particularly in low-income rural communities, have sustained community-wide interventions for more than 10 years and demonstrated the effect of improvements in risk factors on reducing morbidity and mortality. Objective To document health outcomes associated with an integrated, comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction program in Franklin County, Maine, a low-income rural community. Design, setting and participants Forty-year observational study of residents of Franklin County, Maine, a low-income rural population of 22-444 in 1970, using the previous decade as a baseline and comparing Franklin County to other Maine counties state averages. Interventions Community-wide programs targeting high blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, and diet and physical activity sponsored by several community organizations including the local hospital and clinicians. Main results and measures “resident participation”, detection, treatment and control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, smoking cessation rates, hospitalization rates from 1994 to 2006 adjusted for median household income, and mortality rates from 1970 to 2010 adjusted for household income and age. Results More than 150,000 individual contacts with county residents over 40 years of age Relevant health indicators improved over time as cardiovascular risk factor programs were added Hypertension control had an absolute increase of 24.7% (95% CI, 21.6% - 27.7% ) from 18.3% to 43.0%, from 1975 to 1978. Later, increased cholesterol control had an absolute increase of 28.5% (95% CI, 25.3% - 31.6%) from 0.4% to 28.9%, from 1986 to 2010 rates improved from 48.5% to 69.5%, better than the national average (Observed?-?Expected [O?-?E], 11.3 %, 95% CI, 5.5%-17.7%, P?<?.001), 1996-2000. These differences later disappeared as Maine's overall smoking cessation rate increased. Franklin County hospitaliz per capita were less than expected for the measured period 1994-2006 (O?-?E, -17 discharges/1000 population; 95% CI -20.1 to -13.9; P?<?.001) . Franklin was the only Maine county with a consistently lower than predicted adjusted mortality rate over the periods 1970-1989 and 1990-2010 (O?-?E, -60.4 deaths/100,000; 95% CI, -97.9 to - 22.8; P?<?.001 and -41.6/100?000; 95% CI, -77.3 to -5.8; P?=?.005). Changes to improve the health of one Maine county's population were associated with a 40-year reduction in hospital admissions and mortality rates compared to the rest of the state. Further studies are needed to assess the generalizability of such programs, particularly to other populations in the US -Counties to assess rural and other parts of the world.",0,0,
406,Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder,"Background: Second-generation antidepressants dominate the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), but the evidence on the comparative benefits and harms of these agents is conflicting. Purpose: To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of MDD in adults. Data sources: English-language studies from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to August 2011, and reference lists of relevant reviews and gray literature. Study selection: 2 independent reviewers identified randomized studies of at least 6 weeks duration to assess efficacy and observational studies of at least 1000 participants to assess harm. Data extraction: The reviewers abstracted data on study design and conduct, participants, interventions and outcomes, and assessed study quality. A lead reviewer reviewed and endorsed extracted data and quality assessments. DATA SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses and mixed-treatment comparisons of treatment response and weighted mean differences were performed on specific scales assessing depression. Based on 234 studies, no clinically relevant differences in efficacy or efficacy were identified for the treatment of acute, continuation and maintenance phases of MDD. No differences in efficacy were observed in patients with concomitant symptoms or in subgroups based on age, gender, race, or comorbid conditions. Individual drugs differed in onset of action, adverse events, and some measures of health-related quality of life. Limitations: Most studies were performed in highly selected populations. Publication bias may affect the estimates of some comparisons. Comparisons of mixed treatments cannot definitively rule out differences in efficacy. Evidence within subgroups was limited. Conclusion: The current evidence does not justify the recommendation of any particular second-generation antidepressant based on differences in efficacy. Differences in onset of action and side effects can be considered when choosing a drug.",0,0,
407,Comparative benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants: background paper for the American College of Physicians,"Background: Second-generation antidepressants dominate the treatment of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and subsyndromic depression. Evidence on the comparative benefits and harms is still growing. Purpose: To compare the benefits and harms of second-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine) in the treatment of depressive disorders in adults. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007, limited to English language articles. Reference lists of relevant review articles were manually searched and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research database was searched to identify unpublished research. Study selection: Abstracts and full-text articles were independently reviewed by 2 people. Six previous systematic reviews or meta-analyses of good or reasonable quality were included, as were 155 double-blind, placebo-controlled or directly randomized controlled trials of good or reasonable quality of at least 6 weeks duration. Duration. For harm, 35 observational studies with at least 100 participants and a minimum follow-up of 12 weeks were also included. and results. Data Synthesis: When data were sufficient, meta-analyses of head-to-head studies were performed to determine the relative utility of treatment response and weighted mean differences on specific depression rating scales. When sufficient evidence was not available, adjusted indirect comparisons were performed using meta-regressions and network meta-analyses. Based on 203 studies, second-generation antidepressants did not differ significantly in efficacy or efficacy in treating major depressive disorder"";"" however, the incidence of specific adverse events and onset of effect varied. There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the comparative efficacy, efficacy, or harms of these agents for the treatment of dysthymia and subsyndromic depression. Limitation: Adjusted indirect comparisons have methodological limitations and cannot definitively rule out differences in efficacy. Conclusion: The current evidence it does not justify choosing one second-generation antidepressant over another based on differences in efficacy and potency. Other differences in terms of onset of action and side effects may be relevant when choosing a drug.",0,0,
408,Comparing the effectiveness of audit feedback versus additional physician communication training in improving cancer screening for patients with limited health literacy,"BACKGROUND: We have developed a Continuing Medical Education (CME) program to teach primary care physicians (PCP) how to engage in cancer risk communication and shared decision-making with patients with impaired health literacy (HL). OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether training primary care physicians in addition to audit feedback improves their communication skills and increases cancer prevention in patients with impaired HL to a greater extent than just providing feedback on clinical performance. DESIGN: 4-year cluster randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen PCPs and 168 patients with limited HL who were overdue for colon/breast/cervical cancer screening. INTERVENTIONS: Communication intervention PCPs received skills training that included standardized patient (SP) feedback on counseling behavior. All GP practices underwent biannual chart audits of patient screening status for up to 24 months and received two annual performance feedback reports. MAIN INTERVENTIONS: PCPs experienced three unannounced SP encounters in which SPs rated PCP communication behavior. We examined differences between groups in changes in SP scores and patients' knowledge of cancer screening guidelines over 12 months, as well as changes in patients' cancer screening rates over 24 months. KEY RESULTS: There were no group differences in SP scores. Ratings of physician communication at baseline At follow-up, PCPs with communication intervention were rated higher in general communication about cancer risks and shared decision-making related to colorectal cancer screening than PCPs who received only performance feedback Screening rates increased in PCP patients in both groups ."" However, there were no differences between the groups in screening rates, with the exception of mammography. The communication intervention did not improve patients' knowledge of cancer prevention. CONCLUSION: Compared to pure audit and feedback, PCP communication training improves patient-centered PCP counseling behavior but not cancer prevention in patients with impaired HL. Larger studies need to be conducted to determine whether lack of change in cancer screening is due to clinic/patient sample size or whether communication training is ineffective in changing outcomes.",0,1,

410,Comparative effectiveness of measures to promote hand hygiene in the hospital: systematic review and network meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relative effectiveness of the World Health Organization 2005 Campaign (WHO-5) and other interventions in promoting hand hygiene among healthcare workers in hospitals and summarize associated resource use information. DESIGN Systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, CINAHL, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, NHS Center for Reviews and Dissemination, Cochrane Library and the EPOC Registry (December 2009 to February 2014)”; Studies included in previous systematic reviews (1980-2009) REVIEW METHODS Studies included were randomized controlled trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time-series studies investigating an intervention to improve adherence to hand hygiene by healthcare professionals in hospital settings and to Measurement of compliance or appropriate proxies implemented for it met predefined qualitative inclusion criteria Primary data were re-analyzed when studies had not used appropriate analysis methods Random effects and network meta-analysis were performed for studies reporting directly observed hand hygiene compliance when compared to interventions as were considered sufficiently homogeneous and participants extracted information on the resources required for the intervention and divided into three stages. RESULTS Of 3639 studies retrieved, 41 met the inclusion criteria (six randomized controlled studies, 32 interrupted time series, one non-randomized study and two controlled before-after studies). Meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials showed that adding goals to WHO-5 was associated with improved compliance (pooled odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.76; I(2) = 81%) . Of 22 pairwise comparisons from interrupted time series, 18 showed a stepwise increase in hand hygiene compliance, and all but four showed a trend of increasing compliance after the intervention. The network meta-analysis indicated considerable uncertainty regarding the relative effectiveness of interventions, but still provided evidence that WHO-5 is effective and that compliance can be further improved by adding interventions such as goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability . Nineteen studies reported clinical outcomes; The resulting data was consistent with clinically meaningful reductions in infection rates that result from improved hand hygiene for some, but not all, major hospital pathogens. Reported intervention costs ranged from US$225 to US$4669 (£146 to £3035; £204 to £4229) per 1000 bed days. CONCLUSION Promotion of hand hygiene with WHO-5 is effective in increasing compliance among healthcare workers. Adding goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability strategies can lead to further improvements. Reporting on the resources required for such interventions remains poor.",0,1,
411,Comparing the cost effects of two quality strategies to improve testing design in primary care: a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the costs and cost reductions of an innovative strategy to improve GP test ordering routines compared to a traditional strategy. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized controlled trial with group-level randomization of local GPs. SETTING: Primary care: Local groups of GPs in five regions of the Netherlands with diagnostic centers. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven existing local GP groups, including 194 GPs. INTERVENTION: The test ordering strategy was developed systematically, combining feedback, policy education, and small-group quality improvement sessions. In regular quality meetings in local groups, GPs mutually discussed test order behavior, related it to guidelines and created individual and/or group plans for changes. Thirteen groups participated in the entire strategy (full intervention arm), while 14 groups received only feedback (feedback arm). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Ongoing costs, development costs and research costs were calculated for the intervention period per general practitioner per 6 months. The average costs of ordered tests per primary care physician for 6 months were assessed at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS: The new strategy cost 702.00 while the feedback strategy cost 58.00. When only ongoing costs were taken into account, the intervention cost 554.70, compared with 17.10 per GP and 6 months in the feedback arm. Excluding the opportunity costs for the doctors' time, the intervention costs were 92.70 per doctor per 6 months in the entire intervention arm. The average cost reduction that physicians in this arm achieved by reducing unnecessary testing was 144 greater per physician per 6 months than physicians in the feedback arm (p=0.048). CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, including the expected non-monetary benefits, we recommend further long-term impact and cost-effectiveness studies on the implementation of the quality strategy.",0,1,
412,To compare the effectiveness of staff and domestic staff instruction in an intervention to improve hypertension management,"PURPOSE: To determine whether a resident physician can be as effective as a faculty opinion leader in changing physician adherence to a hypertensive practice guideline. METHOD: In a general internal medicine clinic affiliated with an internal medicine education program, sequential charts were reviewed for patients with uncontrolled or new-onset hypertension routinely assessed over a two-week period. Subsequently, 23 providers were randomly assigned to an academic intervention to implement a hypertension practice guideline led by a single second-year Resident Instructor (RI), and 21 providers were assigned to the same intervention led by a single staff member Internists (SI) with an interest in hypertension. The intervention included academic detailing, chart audit with feedback, and behavioral reinforcement. Six weeks later, the chart audit was repeated to assess the change in practice patterns among providers who were taught by the RI compared to those who were taught by the SI. RESULTS: Overall, guideline-compliant management improved from 32% (51/157) to 45% (56/123) (p<0.01) after the intervention. This change was due to improvement in care provided by SI-guided intervention providers: 28% (17/60) to 57% (26/46) (p<0.003). Providers of the RI-guided intervention showed no improvement: 35% (34/97) to 39% (30/77) (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was effective in improving provider adherence to a hypertension practice guideline, but only when guided by a faculty opinion leader. A resident trainer using the same format was unable to change the behavior of the providers.",1,1,
413,Comparison of strategies to reduce meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus rates in surgical patients: a controlled multicenter intervention study.,"Aim To compare the effect of two strategies (improved hand hygiene vs. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening and decolonization) alone and in combination on MRSA rates in surgical wards. Design Prospective, controlled, interventional cohort study with 6-month baseline, 12-month intervention, and 6-month washout period. Establishment of 33 surgical wards in 10 hospitals in nine countries in Europe and Israel. Participants All patients admitted to the enrolled wards for more than 24 hours. Interventions The two strategies compared were (1) increased promotion of hand hygiene and (2) universal MRSA screening with contact precautions and decolonization (intranasal bathing with mupirocin and chlorhexidine) of MRSA carriers. Four hospitals were assigned to each intervention and two hospitals combined both strategies using targeted MRSA screening. Outcome measures Monthly rates of clinical MRSA cultures per 100 susceptible patients (primary outcome) and MRSA infections per 100 admissions (secondary outcome). A planned subgroup analysis for clean surgical wards was performed. Results After accounting for clustering and potential confounders, neither strategy was associated with significant changes in MRSA rates when used alone. The combination of both strategies was associated with a 12% reduction in the rate of clinical MRSA cultures per month (adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98). On clean surgery wards, strategy 2 (MRSA screening, contact precautions, and decolonization) was with decreasing rates of clinical MRSA cultures (15% monthly decrease, aIRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97) and MRSA infections (17% monthly decrease, aIRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). Conclusions On surgical wards with relatively low MRSA prevalence, a combination of improved standard and MRSA-specific infection control approaches was required to reduce MRSA rates. Delivering individual interventions was not effective except in clean operating rooms, where MRSA screening coupled with contact precautions and decolonization was associated with significant reductions in clinical MRSA culture and infection rates.",0,1,
414,Comparing the instructional effectiveness of web-based CME to live interactive CME workshops: a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Despite evidence that a variety of continuing medical education (CME) techniques can promote behavior change in physicians, there have been no randomized trials comparing the performance outcomes of physicians who participated in internet-based CME versus physicians who participated in a live -CME intervention with documented approaches to be effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Internet-based CME can produce changes comparable to those achieved by live, small-group, interactive CME in physician knowledge and behaviors that impact patient care. DESIGN, SETUP AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized controlled study conducted from August 2001 to July 2002. Participants were 97 general practitioners from 21 practice centers in Houston, Texas, including 7 community health centers and 14 private group practices. A control group of 18 physicians from the same centers received no intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Physicians were randomly assigned to an internet-based CME intervention that could be completed in multiple sessions over a 2-week period, or to a single, live, small-group interactive CME workshop. Both included similarly multi-faceted teaching approaches that have proven effective in live settings. The content was based on the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health National Cholesterol Education Program - Adult Treatment Panel III. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge was assessed immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 12 weeks later. The percentage of high-risk patients who had adequate lipid panel screening and guideline-compliant pharmacotherapeutic treatment was documented with chart audits conducted over a 5-month period before the intervention and over a 5-month period after the intervention. RESULTS: Both interventions resulted in similar and significant immediate and 12-week knowledge gains, representing a large increase in the percentage of correct items (pretest to posttest: 31.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 27.0% - 35.0 %]"", pre-test at 12 weeks: 36.4% [95% CI, 32.2%-40.6%]; P or = 93%) without significant post-interventional change However, the internet-based intervention was associated with a significant increase in Proportion of high-risk patients associated with pharmacotherapy according to guidelines (preintervention 85.3%; postintervention 90.3%; P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: A properly designed, evidence-based online CME can produce objectively measured behavioral changes and sustained knowledge gains comparable to those or superior to that achieved through effective live activities.",1,1,

Several studies have examined the effect of sending reminder emails, but few have compared alternative ways of reminding patients to be vaccinated. In one from 23.10. In a randomized study conducted between December 31, 1984 and 939 patients over the age of 65 in four family practices, we compared three ways of reminding elderly patients about the vaccination: personal reminder by the doctor, reminder by telephone by the nurse and reminder by letter. The vaccination rates for the three groups were 22.9%, 37% and 35.1%, respectively. No reminder was issued to a control group and the rate was 9.8%. Some patients could not be reached by phone, others did not come to the doctor during the specified time. Among the patients the nurse actually contacted, the vaccination rate was 43.5%"";"" the rate for patients the doctor actually saw was 45.1%. Overall, a telephone reminder by the nurse was the most effective method, and at $16 an hour or less, it would also be the least expensive method.

CAM can include homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal therapy, antioxidant therapy, and numerous holistic or behavioral techniques. Allergists and physicians of all specialties will encounter patients using CAM treatments, making it imperative that they become familiar with the scientific literature surrounding them. Given the high prevalence of allergic diseases and the associated costs of CAM treatments, evidence of CAM therapies is required to establish appropriate guidelines for their use. The effectiveness of CAM modalities should be demonstrated with randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, including monitoring of adverse events. Of all CAM therapies studied for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, some herbal therapies and antioxidants show a trend towards some clinical efficacy. Researchers have yet to determine how these CAM modalities can be integrated into the general treatment paradigm of allergic rhinitis.",0,0,

The process and job satisfaction of pharmacists,"AIM: In the IPMP (Pulmonary Medication Profiling Principle) study, tailored pharmaceutical care interventions were provided for pulmonary patients selected for drug consumption deviating from Dutch guidelines. The aim was to solve drug-related problems and improve drug use among patients. This article describes the pharmaceutical care process tailored to the individual problems of the patients in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled trial and defines the care package. Methods: After preselecting patients using the IPMP algorithmic computer tool, trained Dutch community pharmacists conducted structured interviews with patients (aged 13-70 years) in the intervention arm to identify behavior and specific problems with their medication. Based on this identification process, a tailored intervention was constructed, which could include one or more of six pharmaceutical treatment modules. The modules have been grouped into sets that describe the complete program of care for a patient. When necessary, pharmacists consulted patients' doctors to improve the prescribed therapy. After the interventions, medication changes were evaluated with the patients. The medication prescribed and the refill rate were monitored in the pharmacy computer over 1 year. All activities and results were extensively monitored and documented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Process description, ie number of pharmaceutical supply modules and medication changes provided. pharmacist satisfaction. RESULTS: Tailored interventions were offered to 199 patients at risk of suboptimal drug therapy. A total of 813 pharmaceutical supply modules were carried out and documented and clustered into four different programs.

421,Complexities of fall prevention in the clinical setting: a commentary,"Falls and related injuries and mortality are a growing concern for aging Americans. Effective fall risk management is an intricate process that requires the involvement of both healthcare professionals and older adults for three related actions: (a) early detection to identify risk factors, (b) prescribing tailored interventions, and (c) implementing adherence and compliance Intervention by the older adult. Early identification of fall risk can prevent future falls;"" However, the uptake of evidence-based screening and assessment protocols in the clinical setting has been limited. A variety of practice guidelines and financial incentives are available to healthcare professionals to facilitate adoption. However, a gap remains between recommended practices and current clinical activities. This commentary addresses the complexities of fall prevention practices and offers solutions that may facilitate adoption by clinical practice. To this end, this commentary presents two models (i.e., a clinical approach and a financial incentive approach ) to summarize current clinical recommendations and practice guidelines for fall risk management in clinical settings. The various factors driving the adoption of evidence-based fall risk management strategies are described. In this synopsis Later, we will discuss how understanding the various system-wide practice improvement initiatives and the factors driving action in physician groups can facilitate the adoption and implementation of fall risk management behaviors by clinicians. Additional efforts are needed to study and evaluate similar initiatives to adopt and implement fall risk management practices at different entry points into the system (e.g., community settings, patients, caregivers).",0,0,
422,Compliance with the biopsy recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator,"UNDESIGNED: Study type - diagnostics (cohort) Evidence level 2b What is known about this topic? and What does the study add? So far, only a few publications have shown that a predictive model influences the behavior of doctors and patients. To our knowledge, it was not known whether urologists and patients adhered to the recommendations of a prostate cancer risk calculator and their reasons for non-compliance. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (ERSPC RC) recommendations on the need for prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. In most cases of non-compliance with the “no biopsy” recommendation, a PSA value >/= 3 ng/ml was decisive for the decision for a biopsy. Prior to large-scale implementation of the ERSPC-RC in urological practices, it is important to gain insight into the use of guidelines that may conflict with adoption of the RC based on conflicting recommendations. OBJECTIVES: To assess the compliance of urologists and patients with a ""no biopsy"" or ""biopsy"" recommendation from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Risk Calculator (RC) and the reasons for non-compliance. Assess determinants of patient compliance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The ERSPC RC calculates the probability of a positive sextant prostate biopsy (P(posb) ) using serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, results of digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography, and prostate volume determined by ultrasonography. A biopsy was recommended if P(posb) >/=20%. Between 2008 and 2011, eight urologists from five Dutch hospitals enrolled 443 patients (aged 55 to 75) after a PSA test without a prior biopsy. Urologists calculated P(posb) using RC in the presence of patients and completed a compliance questionnaire. Patients completed a questionnaire on prostate cancer knowledge, attitudes toward prostate biopsy, self-reported health (12-item Short Form Health Survey), anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory-6, Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), and decision-making measures (Decision Conflict Scale). RESULTS: Both urologists and patients met the RC recommendation in 368 of 443 (83%) cases. When a biopsy was recommended, almost all patients (96%; 257/269) followed, although 63 of the 174 (36%) patients were biopsied against the RC's recommendation. Those who followed a “no biopsy” recommendation had a lower mean P(posb) recommendation than non-compliers (9% vs. 14%; P=3 ng/mL) (78%; 49/63) and patients who because they wanted reassurance (60%; ""38/63). CONCLUSIONS: The ERSPC RC recommendations for prostate biopsy were followed in most patients. The RC may therefore be a promising tool to support clinical decision-making.",0,0,

PATIENTS: Patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia who attended the clinic during a 1-ear period from December 2009 to November 2010 and non-HDL cholesterol management. RESULTS: Seven hundred and seventy charts were reviewed. Only 212 (27.5%) met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of the data revealed better compliance with drug therapy (44% to 77%) and therapeutic lifestyle changes (44% to 83%) compared to follow-up recommendations (22% to 31%). An increase in compliance was also noted across all intervention areas when patients presented with an abnormal lipid profile. LIMITATIONS: Compliance was assessed based solely on electronic medical record documentation and therefore we may underestimate compliance with therapeutic lifestyle changes and follow-up recommendations. CONCLUSION: Internists' compliance in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with hyperlipidemia according to the NCEP-ATP-III guidelines was suboptimal and needs improvement.",0,0,
424,Comprehensive asthma management for underserved children,"In response to the ""asthma epidemic,"" local organizations in San Francisco formed the Yes We Can Urban Asthma Partnership, which uses a comprehensive medical/social model for pediatric asthma care. The Yes We Can Urban Asthma Partnership reaches high-risk children in a variety of clinical settings: urgent visits, the hospital, a comprehensive specialist asthma clinic and through an expanded community health worker program. This article highlights the initial development, implementation and evaluation of the success of this innovative management program to address the problem of pediatric asthma in underserved urban areas.",0,1,
425,Computer criticism integrated into daily clinical practice influences physician behavior - a randomized clinical trial with AsthmaCritic,"OBJECTIVE: We developed AsthmaCritic, a non-prying criticism system integrated into GPs' electronic medical records. The system is based on the guidelines for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. This paper assesses the impact of AsthmaCritic on the monitoring and management of asthma and COPD by Dutch general practitioners in everyday practice. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial in 32 practices (40 Dutch general practitioners) using electronic medical records. AsthmaCritic was administered to an intervention group, while a control group continued to work as usual. The asthma and COPD guidelines, which are routinely distributed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners, were available to both groups. We measured the average number of contacts, FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume) and peak flow measurements per asthma/COPD patient per office"";"" and the average number of antihistamine, cromoglycate, deptropin, and oral bronchodilator prescriptions per asthma/COPD patient per practice. RESULTS: The number of contacts increased in the age group of 12-39 years. The number of FEV1, peak flow measurements, and proportion of coded measurements increased, while the number of cromoglycate prescriptions decreased in the 12-39 year age group. Conclusions: Our study shows that the AsthmaCritic guideline-based criticism system changed the way physicians observed their patients and, to a lesser extent, their treatment behavior. In addition, physicians changed their data collection habits.",0,1,

427,Computer reminders for chlamydia screening in general practice: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background: Chlamydia reporting is increasing in Australia, and the use of a computer alert prompting GPs to test young women is a potential way to increase opportunistic chlamydia testing. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a computer alert in general practice on chlamydia testing in young women. METHODS: In 2006, clinics (n=68) in Melbourne, Australia were randomized into 2 groups: The intervention group received a computerized notification prompting the GP to speak to their patient about chlamydia testing, which surfaced when the medical record a 16 - for 24-year-old female was opened""; the control group received no notification. The outcome was whether or not this patient received a chlamydia test at the level of a single consultation with an eligible patient. Fit of a mixed-effects logistic regression model for clustering was used to assess the impact of the alert on the proportion of women tested for chlamydia during the trial period (CI: 9.1, 15.3) (p<0.01) in the intervention group and 8.8 % (95% CI: 6.8, 10.7) to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.5, 12.7) (p<0.01) in the control group Overall, the intervention group had one n by 27% (OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4) larger increase in testing. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that alerts alone may not be sufficient to raise chlamydia testing levels high enough to have an impact on population chlamydia burden, but could be included as part of a more complex intervention .",0,1,
428,Computer reminders to implement preventive care policies for hospital patients.,"Background: Hospitalizations are a preventive option. Objective: To determine whether computer reminders, which have been shown to be effective in our outpatient care setting, increase the delivery of inpatient preventive care. Methods: Randomized, controlled study of the general medical inpatient service of a city, university public hospital. Study participants were 78 domestic workers rotating in the 6 general medical services. The intervention consisted of reminders to physicians printed on round-of-the-day reports of preventive care their patients were eligible for and suggested orders for preventive care provided through the physician's workstations. The guidelines for prevention were derived from the recommendations of the US Preventive Care Task Force. Adherence to preventive care policy and domestic staff attitude to providing preventive care to hospitalized patients were the key outcome criteria. Results: No significant differences were found between intervention and control physicians in overall adherence to prevention guidelines or in the analysis of individual preventive measures. This was true even though most physicians advocated the provision of most types of preventive care to hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Despite previous success in increasing preventive care in the outpatient setting, we have not been able to increase the provision of preventive care during hospital stays with a moderate-intensity intervention. The physicians attending during the hospital stay were not the patient's primary care physicians, which proved to be an important barrier. More intensive interventions or more direct links between inpatient and outpatient providers may be needed to overcome this resistance. Arch Intern Med. 1996"";""156:1551-1556",0,1,
429,Computer screen saver hand hygiene information curbs a negative trend in hand hygiene behavior.,"Background Adequate hand hygiene for medical personnel is the most important measure for infection prevention"";"" However, compliance is generally low. For-profit messages (i.e., messages that emphasize the benefits of hand hygiene rather than the risks of non-compliance) may be most effective, but have not been tested. Methods The study was conducted in a 27-bed neonatal intensive care unit. We performed a discontinuous time-series analysis of objectively measured hand disinfection events. We used electronic devices in handheld alcohol dispensers that continuously documented the frequency of hand sanitization events. In addition, hand hygiene compliance was directly observed before and after the intervention period. Results The negative trend in hand hygiene events per patient day before the intervention (decrease of 2.3 [standard error, 0.5] per week) changed to a significant positive trend (increase of 1.5 [0.5] per week) after the intervention (P < .001). Direct observations confirmed these results, showing a significant improvement in hand hygiene compliance from 193 of 303 (63.6%) observed hand hygiene events at the pre-test to 201 of 281 (71.5%) at the post-test. Conclusions We conclude that hand hygiene messages displayed on screen savers with gain frames can improve hand hygiene compliance.",1,1,
430,Computerized Clinical Rating Scales. a review,"While clinically performed symptom rating scales are the most commonly used outcome measures in pharmaceutical research, error variance increases the risk of type II errors in multicenter clinical trials due to poor interrater reliability. Such error variance could obscure true differences between active drug and placebo or between two comparator compounds. One solution to this problem is provided by computerized versions of symptom rating scales originally developed for use by trained clinicians. In this paper, empirical data on the reliability, validity, and equivalence of computer-based rating scales are reviewed. Computer-administered versions of clinically-administered scales are now available for assessment of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social phobia. Validation studies demonstrate the reliability, validity and equivalence of these scales. Patient response was positive, with patients generally being more honest with the computer and often preferring it to assess sensitive areas such as suicide, alcohol or drug abuse, sexual behavior or HIV-related symptoms. Applications using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology facilitate long-term patient monitoring without requiring physician visits to collect data, improve physician accessibility of information, and improve the quality of patient care through more informed decisions. When used in accordance with established ethical guidelines, computers offer a reliable, inexpensive, accessible, and time-efficient means of assessing psychiatric symptoms.",0,0,
431,Computerized Decision Support for Pediatric Asthma Management: Description and Feasibility of the Stop Asthma Clinical System,"Clinical guidelines can be helpful in managing asthma. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can improve adherence to clinical guidelines, but typically do not provide physicians with guidance on behavior modification strategies to encourage patient self-management. The Stop Asthma Clinical System (SACS) is a DSS designed for this purpose. To assess feasibility, seven clinicians used SACS to guide well visits in 26 predominantly persistent pediatric asthma patients. Data were collected through surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews. SACS improved assessment of asthma severity and control, classification and intervention for problems with medications and environmental triggers, and development of an action plan (all p<0.05). Communication between doctor and patient has been improved. The biggest challenge was that SACS increased the visiting hours in the clinic. SACS may improve clinical behavior to improve patient asthma self-management, but further studies are warranted to mitigate time constraints and assess the impact on physician-patient communication and behavior, and clinical outcomes.",0,0,
432,Computer-aided clinical decision support when ordering medication for patients with renal insufficiency.,"Aim: To determine whether a computer-assisted clinical decision support system that provides real-time, patient-specific recommendations improves the quality of prescribing for patients with renal impairment in long-term care. Design: Randomized study within the long-term wards of a large long-term care facility. Randomization was within blocks by unit type. Alerts related to prescribing medications for residents with renal impairment were displayed to prescribers in the intervention units and hidden but tracked in the control units. Measurement: The proportions of final drug prescriptions that were appropriate were compared between intervention and control units within alert categories: (1) recommended drug doses”, (2) recommended administration frequencies, (3) recommendations to avoid the drug, (4) warning outcomes : Alert rates were nearly equal in the intervention and control units: 2.5 per 1,000 residential days in the intervention units and 2.4 in the control units. The proportions of dose alerts for which final drug prescriptions were appropriate were similar between the intervention and Control units (relative risk 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.83, 1.1) for the remaining alert categories Significantly higher proportions of final drug prescriptions were appropriate in the intervention units: relative risk 2.4 for maximum frequency (1.4, 4.4) ; 2.6 for drugs to be avoided (1.4, 5.0);"" and 1.8 for warnings about capturing missing information (1.1, 3.4). Overall, final drug prescriptions were significantly more appropriate in intervention units—relative risk 1 ,2 (1.0, 1.4) Conclusions: Clinical decision support for physicians prescribing drugs for long-term care users with renal impairment can improve the quality of prescribing decisions.",1,1,
433,Computational Cholesterol Control in the Community (4C): Addressing the Challenge of Secondary Prevention.,"Background: Dyslipidemia remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in patients with coronary artery disease. The Computer-based Clinical Decision Support System offers an opportunity to close these gaps. Aims: To study the impact of computer-assisted interventions on secondary prevention of CHD[1]. Methods: The CDSS[2] was programmed to automatically identify patients with CHD and assess the availability of an updated lipoprotein profile and treatment with lipid-lowering drugs. The program automatically created computer-generated monitoring and treatment recommendations. Adapted primary hospitals were randomized to intervention (n=56) or standard of care (n=56) arms. Reminders were sent every 4 months to the primary medical teams in the intervention arm to update them with current lipid levels and recommendations for further treatment. Compliance and lipid levels were monitored. The study group included all patients with CAD who were alive at least 3 months after hospitalization. Results: Follow-up was available for 7448 patients with CHD (median 19.8 months, range 6-36 months). Overall, 51.7% of patients were adequately screened and 55.7% of patients adhered to recommended lipid-lowering treatment. A significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein levels was observed in both arms, but was more pronounced in the intervention arm: 121.9 ± 34.2 vs. 124.3 ± 34.6 mg/dL (P<0.02). A significantly lower rate of cardiac readmissions was documented in patients adequately treated with lipid-lowering drugs, 37% vs. 40.9% (P<0.001). Conclusions: This initial review of our data represents a real snapshot in which physicians and CHD patients often fail to follow clinical guidelines, representing a major obstacle to implementing effective secondary prevention. Our automatic EDP-supported reminder system makes it much easier to comply with guidelines and supports comprehensive implementation.",0,1,
434,Computer-aided decision support based on clinical practice guideline improves adherence to standards of care,"PURPOSE: Clinical guidelines are intended to aid in the management of specific diseases”, however, these guidelines are often neglected in the provision of care at the patient visit To have a practice guideline based decision support system that provides a personalized treatment protocol for each patient using data from the At the clinic, 58 primary care physicians were randomized to receive either a dedicated interview form containing the computer-generated guideline recommendations or a standard interview form. The impact of computer-generated advice on clinical behavior was measured as the rate of adherence to the guideline recommendations. Data from 30 clinicians were analyzed; Data from 28 clinicians were excluded because these clinicians did not meet the predefined criteria for minimum exposure to diabetic care. RESULTS: The Ver Availability of patient management recommendations generated by the decision support system resulted in a two-fold increase in clinical compliance with diabetes mellitus treatment guidelines (P=0.01). The median compliance for the group receiving the referrals was 32.0% versus 15.6% for the control group. CONCLUSION: Decision support based on a clinical practice guideline is a powerful tool to support physicians in the management of diabetics. This decision support system provides a model of how a clinical practice guideline can be computer integrated into the nursing process to help clinicians manage a specific disease by helping them maintain standards of care. The use of decision support systems based on clinical practice guidelines could ultimately improve the quality of medical care.",0,1,
435,Computer-aided decision support for drug dosing in renal failure: a randomized controlled trial.,"Aim of the study Emergency physicians prescribe several discharge medications that require dose adjustments to patients with renal disease. The hypothesis for this research was that decision support in a computerized prescription entry system would reduce the rate of drug overdosing in patients with renal impairment. Methods This was a randomized, controlled study in an academic emergency department (ED) in which computerized physician order entry was used to write all prescriptions for patients discharged from the emergency department. The sample consisted of 42 physicians who were randomly assigned to the intervention (21 physicians) or control (21 physicians) group. The intervention was a decision aid that provided dosing recommendations for targeted drugs for patients 18 years of age and older when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance was below the threshold for dose adjustment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of targeted drugs that were overdosed. Results At 2,783 (46%) of the 6,015 patient visits, the decision aid had sufficient information to estimate the patient's creatinine clearance. The mean age of these patients was 46 years, 1768 (64%) were female and 1523 (55%) were black. Physicians in the intervention group who overdosed 31 (43%) prescriptions were given decision support 73 times. In comparison, control physicians overdosed a significantly larger proportion of drugs: 34 of 46, 74% (effect size = 31%; 95% confidence interval 14% to 49%; P = 0.001). Conclusion EMS physicians often overdosed drugs that require dose adjustments in renal impairment Computerized entry of physician orders with decision support significantly reduced overdosing of targeted drugs.",1,1,
436,Computer-assisted decision support to reduce potentially inappropriate prescriptions to elderly patients in the emergency department: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of computer-assisted decision support in reducing potentially inappropriate prescriptions to older adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: An academic emergency department (ED) in Indianapolis, Indiana, where computerized physician order entry was used to write all drug prescriptions. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three emergency physicians were randomly assigned to the intervention (32 physicians) or control (31 physicians) groups. INTERVENTION: Decision support that advised against the use of nine potentially inappropriate drugs and recommended safer replacement therapies. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of ED visits by seniors that resulted in one or more prescriptions for an inappropriate drug. Key secondary endpoints were the proportions of medications prescribed that were inappropriate and intervention physicians' reasons for refusing decision support. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 74 years, two thirds were women and just over half were African American. Intervention physicians were given decision support 114 times, who accepted 49 (43%) of the recommendations. Intervention physicians prescribed one or more inappropriate medications in 2.6% of seniors' emergency department visits, compared with 3.9% of visits performed by control physicians (P = 0.02; ""odds ratio = 0.55, 95 % confidence interval = 0.34-0.89) The proportion of all prescribed medications that were inappropriate decreased significantly from 5.4% to 3.4% The most common reason for refusing decision support was that the patient did not have any had previous problems with medication CONCLUSION: Computer-assisted physician prescribing with decision support significantly reduces prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications to seniors This approach could be used in other efforts to improve ED care.",1,1,
437,Computerized reminders to promote cervical screening in the general practice.,"randomized study compared three ways to increase cervical screening rates in women attending a primary care center. Based on computerized medical records, 1,587 women aged 18 to 35 who were overdue for a screening test were enrolled in the study. In a control group, no formal method was used to encourage patients to participate in screening, and 13.7 percent received a test within the study year. In one intervention group, the doctor received a message identifying the women who attended the center for a routine appointment and were due for screening. 16.1 percent were screened. Sending a letter to patients in a second group resulted in a 25.9 percent compliance rate. In a third group, the practice nurse called patients on the phone to advise them to take the test, and 20.0 percent complied. Doctor reminders represent a low-cost, opportunistic approach to reaching women who come to the office by chance, but this approach should be supplemented with telephone or written mailings from women who do not come to the office regularly.",0,1,

441,Consensus on guidelines for stereotactic neurosurgery in psychiatric disorders,"BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical procedures may be considered in patients with psychiatric disorders who remain refractory to ""standard"" therapies. Guidelines for safely and ethically conducting such procedures have been previously and independently proposed by various local and regional expert groups. METHODS: To expand on these earlier documents, representative members of continental and international psychiatric and neurosurgical societies have come together to further elaborate and adopt a pragmatic worldwide set of guidelines. These are designed to address a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, brain targets, and neurosurgical techniques, while taking into account the cultural and social heterogeneities of the healthcare environment. RESULTS: The proposed consensus document highlights that while stereotactic ablative procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy for depression and OCD are considered “established” in some countries, they still lack level I evidence. It is further noted that deep brain stimulation is still under investigation in all brain targets attempted to date and in all psychiatric or behavioral disorders. Researchers are encouraged to develop randomized controlled trials based on scientific and data-supported rationale for disease and brain target selection. Experienced multidisciplinary teams are imperative to safely and ethically perform any psychiatric neurosurgery, ensuring documented patient refractoryity, proper consent procedures that respect patient capacity and autonomy, multifaceted preoperative as well as postoperative long-term follow-up assessment, and reporting of effects and side effects for all patients. INTERPRETATION: This consensus document on the ethical and scientific conduct of psychiatric surgery worldwide is intended to improve patient safety.",0,0,

PARTICIPANTS: The 4 members of the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety were James C. Ballenger (Chairman), Jonathan RT Davidson, Yves Lecrubier and David J. Nutt. Four faculty invited by the Chair also attended: David S. Baldwin, Johan A. den Boer, Siegfried Kasper and M. Katherine Shear. EVIDENCE: The consensus statement is based on the 6 reviews published in this supplement and on the scientific literature relevant to these topics. CONSENSUS PROCESS: Group meetings took place over a period of 2 days. On the first day, the group discussed each review paper and the chair and panelist (Dr. Kasper) identified key issues for further discussion. On the second day, the group discussed these key issues to come to a consensus. After the group sessions, the consensus statement was drafted by the chair and approved by all present. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus statement provides standard definitions of response and remission and identifies appropriate strategies for the management of panic disorder in primary care. Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors are recommended as the first-line treatment for 12 to 24 months of treatment. The pharmacotherapy should be withdrawn slowly over a period of 4 to 6 months.",0,0,
443,Theory of resource conservation and research use in health systems,"Background Health systems face challenges in using research results to improve policy and practice. These challenges are particularly evident in small and underresourced health systems, often located in locations (in Canada and globally) with poorer health conditions. Although organizational resources have been recognized as important for understanding research usage resources, knowledge translation (KT) theories have not been the focus. What resources are broadly required for KT and how does their presence or absence affect research exploitation? In this paper, we consider resource conservation theory (COR) as a theoretical basis for understanding the ability to use research evidence in health systems. Three components of the COR theory are examined in the context of KT. First, resources are needed for research uptake. Second, the risk of resource loss encourages resistance to research exploitation. Third, even in resource-constrained environments, resources can be optimized to build capacity for KT. Methods A scan of the KT literature examined organizational resources needed for research purposes. A multiple case study approach examined the three components of the COR theory outlined above. The multiple case study consisted of a desk review and key informant interviews with members of the research team, including government decision makers and health practitioners, through a retrospective analysis of four previously conducted applied health research studies in a resource-constrained region. Results The literature scan identified organizational resources influencing research use. The multiple case study supported these findings, helped develop a taxonomy of organizational resources, and demonstrated how fears of resource loss can impact research use. Some resources were found to fill other resource deficiencies. Resource requirements varied at different stages of the research exploitation process. Conclusions COR theory contributes to understanding the role of resources in research use, resistance to research use, and potential strategies to improve research use. Resources (and lack thereof) may account for the observed disparities in research uptake across health care systems. This paper provides a theoretical basis for further investigation of the COR-KT ideas and the necessary support for research deployment in resource-constrained environments.",0,0,
444,Counseling training of nurses for cardiovascular prevention - a randomized study over 2 years duration,"The aim of this study was to increase patient adherence to treatment for hypertension through nurse counseling. 33 nurses were included in the study. In the intervention group (IG), 19 nurses participated in a 3-day inpatient training course on the Stages of Change model, motivational interviewing, and guidelines for cardiovascular prevention and recruited 153 patients. Sixteen nurses in the control group (CG) recruited 59 patients. In both groups, a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and total cholesterol was observed over the 2 years. heart rate (p=0.027), body mass index (p=0.019), weight (p=0.0001), waistline (p=0.041), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.0001), the Waist-to-hip ratio (p=0.024), and perceived stress (p=0.001) decreased sharply in the IG only. After 2 years, 52.6% of the patients in the IG (p = 0.13) reached the target of </= 140/90 mmHg blood pressure compared to 39.2% in the CG. There was a significant (p=0.021) difference between the groups for self-reported physical activity. The positive effects of counseling training on patients' weight parameters, physical activity, perceived stress, and the proportion of patients achieving blood pressure control emphasize counseling training and the use of behavioral models to motivate patients to adhere to treatment.",0,0,
445,Consumer satisfaction among patients and their GPs about the involvement of nurses in the primary care of patients with urinary incontinence,"BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a very common problem, but existing guidelines on UI are not followed. To bring care in line with guidelines, we designed an intervention to involve UI nurses in primary care and evaluated this in a randomized controlled trial. In parallel with this intervention, we assessed consumer satisfaction among patients and general practitioners (GPs). Methods: Patients' satisfaction with the care provided by specialist nurses (intervention group) or general practitioners (control group) was measured using a self-completed questionnaire. GPs' views on nurse involvement were measured in a structured telephone interview. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with nurse care was 8.4 (scale 1-10) versus 6.7 for primary care. Over 85% of patients would recommend the care of a nurse to their best friends, and 77% of GPs found the nurse's role beneficial, giving it an average rating of 7.2. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample was relatively small and the stability of the results was only tentatively noted, the substitution of UI care from a primary care physician to a specialist nurse seems to be welcomed by both patients and primary care physicians. Small changes such as providing additional UI-specific information and paying more attention to UI (which previously received little attention) would provide an easy tool to stimulate patients to change their behavior in the right direction.",0,0,

447,Contemporary Perspectives in Tobacco Cessation: What Oncologists Need to Know,"In the last 5 years there has been a large increase in research on smoking cessation, significantly encouraged by the publication of the 1996 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. These federal guidelines, published by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research, provided extensive empirical evidence that tobacco cessation interventions are effective and encouraged routine implementation in healthcare settings. Since then, numerous tobacco cessation studies have increased the body of knowledge on successful smoking intervention modalities. Unfortunately, about a third of cancer-related deaths are still attributed to smoking. It is imperative that healthcare providers encourage and participate in the smoking cessation efforts of their patients and family members. This article provides an overview of the current literature on smoking cessation and describes first-line therapies with proven efficacy in smoking cessation. Physicians are encouraged to screen rigorously for tobacco use and to provide brief interventions of behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy to manage their patients' tobacco dependence.",0,0,
448,Emergency management to induce exercise among college students.,"Aim: The effects of contingency management on physical activity induction were investigated in seven non-obese physically inactive undergraduate students by providing cash payments using a multiple baseline, changing criteria procedure. Methods: Participants participated in a baseline phase, a subsequent intervention phase consisting of three training sessions per week for 4 weeks, and a follow-up session 2 weeks after the intervention. A total of $145 was available for attendance and practice payments. Results: Results indicate that all participants significantly increased physical activity during the intervention from inactivity at baseline to three 30-minute sessions per week. Participants maintained some gains during follow-up. Limitations: The study used a small and homogeneous sample size and required participants to train in a laboratory setting, limiting external validity. Conclusions: These results suggest that incentive-based interventions are an effective and feasible means to induce physical activity.

449,Continued driving habits of patients diagnosed with excessive daytime sleepiness,"AIM: To describe the driving behavior of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and the impact of diagnosis, therapy, legal guidelines and advice on their driving behavior. DESIGN: Inventory based on questionnaires. SETTING: Center for Sleep and Waking Disorders, The Hague, The Netherlands. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to all patients with EDS who were stable at least 6 months after therapy (n = 138). The questions concerned actual driving behaviour, EDL and the effects of diagnosis, therapy and advice from the centre. RESULTS: The response was 67% (n=92). Eighteen patients had never driven a car. Eighteen of the other 74 patients stopped driving or drove less. 56 patients did not change their behavior or drove even more. There was little impact on driving behavior from diagnosis, therapy and advice to give up driving. Conclusion: Patients with EDS often participate as drivers in modern road traffic. Legal requirements and medical advice have little influence on this behavior. Since general measures appear to be ineffective, approaches tailored to the individual patient may lead to more acceptable outcomes.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized stratified controlled trial. Surroundings: 12 GP surgeries in Tayside. Subjects: 3373 children aged 1 to 15 inclusive with symptoms suggestive of asthma or possible asthma from a systematic review of 10 725 general practice case files. Intervention: Children were specifically selected for clinical evaluation by their primary care physician or practice nurse. Main Outcome Measures: Asthma-related consultations, prescriptions, hospital visits, and healthcare costs 12 months before and after the study. Results: Compared to the control group (n=1563), the intervention group (n=1585) had more practice-initiated consultations for asthma (relative risk 2.18 (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 2.73)), new asthma diagnoses (2.83 (2.26 to 3.54)), previous diagnoses confirmed (1.30 (1.08 to 1.58)), and they were prescribed more inhaled cromoglycate (1.52 (1.02 to 2.25)). The number of inpatient hospitalizations decreased from 152 to 122 in the intervention group and increased from 69 to 117 in the control group between the year before and the year after the study. The total cost of primary care increased from £30,118 to £37,243 in the intervention group and fell from £29,131 to £27,990 in the control group. Hospital costs fell from £25,406 to £20,727 in the intervention group and rose from £12,699 to £19,650 in the control group. Conclusion: An audit facilitator can positively influence the diagnosis and treatment pattern of childhood asthma in the family practice. This can have an impact on healthcare costs.",0,1,

The cooperation with the OHI companies was rated as ""very good"" by 10.8%, ""good"" by 56.7%, ""satisfactory"" by 24.2%, ""sufficient"" by 7.0% and by 1.3% assessed as “unsatisfactory”. 93.4% of those surveyed name problems and potential for improvement in the cooperation between their practice or clinic and OHI companies. The main points of criticism were cost reimbursement (44.7%), followed by impairment of treatment options (36.5%) and delay or extent of treatment in the dermatologist's procedure (29.4%). CONCLUSIONS: While most occupational dermatologists assess their cooperation with OHI companies positively, there is potential for quality optimization in the reimbursement of dermatological services, especially in the time-consuming consultation for the prevention of occupational skin diseases, in the enabling of diagnostics and therapy procedures according to current guidelines and in a timely preventive Intervention to use the therapeutic window before skin diseases can become chronic.",0,0,
453,Core outcome measurements for laboratory assessment studies of liability in human opioid abuse: IMMPACT recommendations,"critical component in the development of opioid analgesics is the assessment of their abuse liability (AL). The standardization of approaches and measures to assess AL has the potential to facilitate comparisons between studies, research laboratories and medicines. The objective of this report is to provide consensus recommendations on core outcome measures for evaluating the abuse potential of opioid drugs in humans in a controlled laboratory setting. Although many of the recommended measures for assessing the AL of drugs from other drug classes are appropriate, the focus here is on opioid drugs because they present unique risks for both physiological (e.g., respiratory depression, physical dependence) and public health (e.g., B. Individuals) pose in pain) perspectives. A brief historical overview of AL testing is provided, and then those measures that can be considered primary and secondary outcomes and possible additional outcomes in AL assessment are discussed. These outcome measures include the following: subjective effects (some of which include the primary outcome measures, including drug liking), physiological responses, drug self-administration behavior, and cognitive and psychomotor performance. Before recommendations for standardized approaches and measures are presented in AL- assessments, the appropriateness of using these measures in clinical trials of pain patients is discussed.",0,0,
454,Reduction of several risk factors for coronary artery disease. Vendor perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Although primary care physicians understand the importance of preventive services for patients with multiple risk factors (MRF) for coronary artery disease, medical intervention is limited. This study examined (1) physicians' views on the challenges of treating patients with MRF, (2) the counseling and management methods they use, and (3) possible strategies for improving MRF intervention in primary care METHODS: Two focus groups were conducted with primary care physicians from different backgrounds to gain insight into the above issues.Each group was co-moderated by a physician and a behaviorist using a previously developed semi-structured interview guide recorded and then transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparison method for analysis. RESULTS: Physicians are challenged by knowledge limitations (contribution of individual risk factors to overall risk); limited support (guidelines, materials, and staff);"" and logistical difficulties (organizational problems, time constraints). Their approach to MRF management is typically highly individualized with an initial preference for lifestyle modification interventions rather than prescription drugs under certain conditions. Physicians preferred a serial rather than parallel approach to MRF intervention, beginning with behaviors that the patient perceives to be paramount. Proposed solutions to current challenges emphasize medical education and the development of innovative approaches that involve medical assistance and a team approach. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are aware and sensitive to the complexities of MRF management for their patients and themselves. However, future MRF interventions will require the involvement of non-physician staff and increased system support.",0,0,
455,"Management of coronary risk factors in the primary care practice in Shibuya, Tokyo","OBJECTIVES: Many large-scale clinical studies have confirmed that coronary risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus predict a higher incidence of cardiovascular events and that controlling these risk factors reduces the incidence. However, the actual management of such risk factors and the consequent improvement in cardiovascular events in the primary care setting remains unclear. The Heart Care Network Shibuya, a volunteer study group of regional primary care physicians, examined management of coronary risk factors and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Behavioral patterns of coronary artery risk factor management and consequent changes in risk factors were investigated in 209 outpatients (mean age 65.6 +/- 11.2 years) with more than one hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus or previous myocardial infarction after 1 year. RESULTS: The prescriptions of antihypertensive drugs (from 1.3 +/- 0.8 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 drugs per patient) and antihyperlipidemic drugs (from 0.70 +/- 0.4 to 0.73 +/- 0.4 drugs per patient) did not increase significantly. Patient education for diet (93% to 97%, p=0.077), exercise (69% to 81%, p<0.05), and not smoking (66% to 86%, p<0.05) increased significantly at 1 year to. Blood pressure decreased from 142 +/- 16/81 +/- 10 to 138 +/- 78/78 +/- 9 mmHg (p<0.05), total serum cholesterol decreased from 215 +/- 39 to 203+ /- 39 mg/dl (p<0.05). As a result, more patients achieved the treatment goals recommended in the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Hypertension (34.6% to 46.8%) and the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (40.2% to 49.5%), respectively. However, none of the blood hemoglobin A1c levels, body mass index, or smokers changed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Regional practitioners attempted to control for all coronary risk factors. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are relatively more dependent on medical treatment, improved. In contrast, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or smoking, which require lifestyle changes, did not improve. The main problem with risk factor management is how doctors act, not specific actions.",0,0,
456,Cost implications of implementing an electronic decision support system for ordering laboratory tests in primary care: Evidence from a controlled prospective study in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: The economic implications of interventions to encourage rational, evidence-based use of laboratory testing by physicians are not fully understood. We evaluated the cost implications of using a computerized, guideline-driven decision support system (CDSS) for ordering blood tests in primary care. METHODS: We installed the CDSS in 118 practices [159 general practitioners (GPs)] in the Netherlands and calculated the cost of the intervention in this group. In a period of 6 months before and 6 months after installation of the CDSS, the test ordering behavior of 87 (109 general practitioners) of these 118 study practices was examined and the results compared with those of a non-historical control group that did not receive the CDSS. In addition, the costs for laboratory inquiries were calculated for both groups. RESULTS: The total intervention costs, consisting of development costs and installation costs, amounted to 79,000 euros (670 euros per practice). While the introduction of the CDSS did not impact the number of order forms sent to laboratories, it did reduce the number of blood tests per order form. As a result, the CDSS achieved an average cost savings for laboratory inquiries of 847 euros per practice and 6 months. Conclusions: This study shows that the provision of electronic decision-making aids for ordering blood tests in primary care represents an economically promising concept. Savings in laboratory costs can be achieved and are not offset by disproportionately high intervention costs.",1,1,
457,Cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system based on the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for the management of hypercholesterolaemia: report of a cluster-randomized study.,"Introduction and Objectives To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and other societies for the management of hypercholesterolaemia (ESCHM). Study design and perspective A cluster-randomized, open-label, pragmatic study was conducted. To assess the impact on effectiveness and costs of a CDSS implementing an adapted version of the ESCHM recommendations, a parallel comparison with a usual care group was performed over 1 year. The recruitment period started in April 2000 and ended 1 year later. Efficacy was defined as meeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction goals in patients with an initial cardiovascular risk (CVR) > 20% over 10 years (the goals are LDL-C < 115 mg /dl for patients). with coronary artery disease [CAD] or LDL-C < 130 mg/dl for patients without CAD) or maintenance of CVR < 20% at study end in patients with initial CVR < 20%. The costs for treatments, visits and laboratory tests were estimated from a social point of view (calculation year 2002). Methods The ESCHM guidelines, adapted by a steering committee, included therapeutic recommendations aimed at achieving LDL-C goals in a cost-effective manner. To promote a healthy cardiovascular lifestyle, items such as tablecloths and fridge magnets (with appropriate promotional messages) were distributed to intervention practices. All study physicians recorded patient data in a dedicated application installed on their computer. Interventionists had the CDSS installed as an additional module of this application and were encouraged to use it, but were otherwise free to accept or ignore the recommendations. Compliance with the guideline was monitored by the CDSS. Patients with hypercholesterolaemia were selected from 44 general practices in Spain, mainly in the Catalonia region. Main Outcome Parameters and Results 2221 patients were enrolled in the study (1161 in the usual care group and 1060 in the intervention group). The intervention was found to be as effective as usual care in both an unadjusted analysis and after adjustment for absolute CVR and prior treatment with lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% CI 0.58, 1.77]. The intervention had no effect on lipid profiles. Intervention patients were less likely to be prescribed LLDs than usual care patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.26, 0.52; p = 0.0001), particularly when CVR was low. This resulted in significant savings in treatments (p=0.0001) and overall costs (p=0.001), estimated at 24.9% and 20.8%, respectively. The intervention increased the number of laboratory analyses. The CDSS recommendations were accepted in 71.3% of the visits. Discussion and conclusions The CDSS, based on the recommendations of the ESCHM, did not change the effectiveness of usual care, but resulted in significant savings.",0,1,
458,Cost-effectiveness of a manual coping strategy program to promote the mental health of caregivers of people with dementia (the STrAtegies for RelaTives (START) study): a pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the START (STRATEGIES FOR RELATTIVES) intervention is cost-effective in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis embedded in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS Three psychiatric and one neurological dementia outpatient care centers in London and Essex, UK. PARTICIPANTS Family caregivers of people with dementia. INTERVENTION Eight-session, manual-based coping interventions delivered by supervised psychology graduates for caregivers of people with dementia, in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Costs, measured from a health and social care perspective, were analyzed along with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Total Score (HADS-T) of affective symptoms and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in cost-effectiveness analyzes over eight months from baseline. RESULTS Of the 260 participants recruited for the study, 173 were randomized to the START intervention and 87 to usual care alone. Mean HADS-T scores were lower in the intervention group than in the usual treatment group during the 8-month assessment period (mean difference -1.79 (95% CI -3.32 to -0.33)), indicating better outcomes in connection with the START intervention. There was a small improvement in health-related quality of life as measured by QALYs (0.03 (-0.01 to 0.08)). Costs did not differ between the intervention and usual treatment groups (£252 (-28 to 565) higher for the START group). The cost-effectiveness calculations indicated that START measured at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained and a high probability of cost-effectiveness in the HADS-T compared to usual treatment alone. CONCLUSIONS The manual-based coping intervention START, when added to usual care, was cost-effective compared to usual care alone on both endpoints (affective symptoms for caregivers and QALYs in need of care).

459,Cost-effectiveness of strategies to combat neuropsychiatric disorders in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia: mathematical modeling study,"OBJECTIVE To assess the costs and effects of interventions to control five neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, epilepsy and heavy alcohol use). DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING Two sub-regions of the world epidemiologically defined by the World Health Organization: countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality (AfrE)” and countries in Southeast Asia with high adult and high child mortality (SearD). DATA SOURCES Published Studies, Cost Databases KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per capita and cost per year of life prevented (DALY) per disability expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005. RESULTS Over 44 intervention strategies evaluated for the five neuropsychiatric disorders, the cost-effectiveness scores differed by up to two orders of magnitude (from 100-250 Int to 10,000-25,000 Int for a year of healthy life gained) In both subregions, inpatient treatment of schizophrenia with newer antipsychotics was the most expensive and least cost-effective strategy. Region, the most cost-effective intervention was drug treatment for epilepsy in primary care. The cumulative costs per capita of the most cost-effective interventions covering all five conditions were estimated to be 4.90 to 5.70 Int. This package includes interventions for epilepsy (older first-line antiepileptic drugs); depression (commonly manufactured newer antidepressants and psychosocial treatment); bipolar disorder (mood stabilizer lithium); schizophrenia (neuroleptic antipsychotics and psychosocial treatment);"" and heavy alcohol use (increased taxation and enforcement, restricted access and, in the African subregion, advertising bans and brief counseling for heavy drinkers in primary care). CONCLUSIONS Reallocating resources to cost-effective intervention strategies would increase health gain , save money and help implement the much-needed expansion of neuropsychiatric services in under-resourced settings.",0,0,
460,Cost-effectiveness of strategies to address vision and hearing loss in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia: mathematical modeling study,"OBJECTIVE To determine the relative costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness of selected interventions for the control of cataracts, trachoma, ametropia, hearing loss, meningitis, and chronic otitis media. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis of or combined strategies to control vision and hearing loss through a lifetime population model. SETTING Two World Health Organization subregions where vision and hearing loss are major burdens: sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. DATA SOURCES Biological and behavioral parameters from clinical and observational studies and population surveys. Intervention effects and resource input based on published reports, expert opinion and the WHO CHOICE database. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Cost per prevented disability-adjusted life year (DALY) expressed in international dollars ($Int) for 2005. RESULTS Treatment of chronic otitis media, extracapsular cataract surgery, trichiasis surgery, treatment of meningitis, and annual screening of schoolchildren for refractive errors are among the most cost-effective interventions to control hearing and vision impairments, with a cost per DALY averted of <$285 in both regions. Screening school children (annually) and adults (every five years) for hearing loss costs about 1,000 Int per DALY avoided. These interventions can be considered very cost effective. Mass treatment with azithromycin to control trachoma can be considered cost-effective in the African but not in the Southeast Asian subregion. CONCLUSIONS Interventions to control visual and hearing impairments are generally cost-effective. To decide whether significant investment in these interventions is warranted, this finding should be considered in relation to the economic attractiveness of other existing or new healthcare interventions.",0,0,
461,Cost-effectiveness of a nurse-based intervention (AIMS) to improve adherence in HIV-infected patients: design of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"Background Non-compliance with HIV treatment can negatively impact treatment success rates, quality of life, infectivity, and patient life expectancy. Few adherence interventions have shown positive effects on adherence and/or virologic outcomes. The theory- and evidence-based Adherence Improving Self-Management Strategy (AIMS) is an intervention that has been shown to improve adherence and viral suppression rates in a randomized controlled trial. However, there is no evidence of profitability. Following a recent review suggesting that cost-benefit assessments of adherence interventions in chronic disease are rare and that the methodology of such assessments is poorly described in the literature, this manuscript presents the study protocol for a multi-center study to assess efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of AIMS in a Heterogeneous Sample of Patients. Methods/Design The study used a multicenter, randomized, controlled study design to compare the AIMS intervention with usual care from a societal perspective. Embedded in this RCT is an experimental and model-based economic assessment. A planned number of 230 HIV-infected patients will be randomized to receive either AIMS or usual care. Relevant outcomes include changes in adherence, plasma viral load, quality of life, and societal costs. The time horizon for the trial-based economic assessment is 12-15 months. For the model-based economic assessment, costs and effects are extrapolated to a lifetime horizon. Discussion The present multicenter RCT aims to provide robust methodological evidence for the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a nursing-based counseling intervention (AIMS) to support treatment adherence in a large and heterogeneous sample of HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands. The aim of the present paper is to describe the study protocol in sufficient detail to allow a full assessment of the quality of the study design. It is expected that AIMS, if proven cost-effective, can contribute to improved evidence-based counseling guidelines for HIV nurses and other health professionals.",0,1,
462,Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the initial medical management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes: systematic review and decision-analytic modelling,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and prioritize key areas of clinical uncertainty related to the medical management of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in current UK practice. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. Consultations with clinical advisors. Postal survey of cardiologists. REVIEW METHODS: Potential areas of significant uncertainty were identified and “decision problems” prioritized. A systematic literature search was carried out using standard methods. The constructed decision model consisted of a short-term phase applying the results of the systematic review and a long-term phase incorporating relevant information from a UK observational study to extrapolate the estimated costs and impacts. Sensitivity analyzes were performed to examine the dependency of the results on baseline parameters using alternative data sources. Expected value information analysis was performed to estimate the expected value of perfect information related to the decision problem. This provided an upper bound on the monetary value associated with additional research in this area. RESULTS: Seven current areas of clinical uncertainty (decision problems) in drug management for patients with unstable angina pectoris were identified. The active substances affected were clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, hirudin and intravenous glycoprotein antagonists (GPAs). Twelve published clinical guidelines for unstable angina or non-ST elevation ACS were identified, but few provided recommendations on the stated decision problems. The postal survey of clinicians showed that the greatest disagreement was with the use of small molecule GPAs and the greatest uncertainty with decisions related to the use of abciximab (a large molecule GPA). Overall, decision issues related to the GPA class of drugs were considered the top priority for further studies. Selected articles describing the clinical effectiveness of the treatment have been divided into three groups, each representing an alternative strategy. The strategy that included the use of GPAs as part of the initial medical management of all non-ST elevation ACS was the optimal choice, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5738 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) im Comparison without using GPAs. The stochastic analysis showed that if healthcare is willing to pay £10,000 per additional QALY, the probability of this strategy being cost-effective was around 82%, rising to 95% at a threshold of £50,000 per QALY. A sensitivity analysis including an additional strategy of using GPAs as part of the initial medical treatment only in patients at particularly high risk (defined by age, ST depression or diabetes) showed that this additional strategy was even more cost effective with an ICER of £3996 per QALY compared to no treatment with GPA. The value of information analysis suggested that there was significant value for additional research to reduce the level of uncertainty in the optimal decision. Using a threshold of £10,000 per QALY, the maximum possible value of such research in the base case has been calculated at £12.7m per year for the UK as a whole. Taking into account the greater uncertainty in the sensitivity analyzes involving clopidogrel, this figure has been increased to approximately £50m. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes the use of GPAs in all non-ST elevation ACS patients as part of their initial medical management. The sensitivity analysis showed that virtually all of the benefit could be realized if only high-risk patients were treated. Further clarification of the optimal role of GPAs in the UK NHS depends on the availability of further high quality observational and experimental data. The value of information analysis derived from the model suggests that a relatively large investment in such research could be worthwhile. Further research should focus on identifying the characteristics of patients who benefit most from GPAs in the context of medical management, comparing GPAs with clopidogrel as an adjunct to standard of care, follow-up cohort studies on the costs and outcomes of high-risk non- ST elevation ACS over several years and examining how clinicians' decisions combine a normative, evidence-based decision model with their own personal behavioral perspective.",0,0,
463,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant depression in primary care: economic assessment of the CoBalT study,"BACKGROUND: Treating depression is expensive, but providing ineffective treatment is more expensive. This is the case for many patients who do not respond to antidepressants. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to usual care alone. METHOD: Economic evaluation at 12 months alongside a randomized controlled trial. Cost-effectiveness is assessed using a cost-consequence framework that compares costs to the health and social care provider, patients and society against a range of outcomes. Cost-benefit analysis comparing health and social costs with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The average cost of CBT per participant was £910. The difference in QALY gain between groups was 0.057, equivalent to 21 days of good health per year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £14,911 (representing a 74 percent probability that the intervention is cost-effective at the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence threshold of £20,000 per QALY). Loss of income and productivity costs were significant, but there was no evidence of a difference between intervention and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adding CBT to usual care is cost-effective in patients who have not responded to antidepressants. GPs should therefore be encouraged to refer such individuals for CBT.",0,0,
464,Cost-effectiveness of guideline-compliant treatments for low back pain: a systematic review,"The healthcare costs for back pain (LBP) are increasing rapidly. Therefore, it is important to offer treatments that are effective and inexpensive. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the cost-effectiveness of guideline-compliant treatments for LBP. We searched nine clinical and economic electronic databases and the reference list of relevant systematic reviews and included studies for eligible studies. Economic reviews conducted in conjunction with randomized controlled trials evaluating treatments for LBP supported by American College of Physicians and American Pain Society guidelines were included. Two independent reviewers reviewed search results and extracted data. The data extracted included the nature and perspective of the economic assessment, the comparator treatments, and the relative cost-effectiveness of the comparator treatments. 26 studies were included. Most studies found that interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, or cognitive-behavioral therapy was cost-effective in people with subacute or chronic LBP. Massage alone probably wasn't cost effective. There were conflicting results on the cost-effectiveness of counseling, insufficient evidence on spinal manipulation in people with acute LBP, and no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of medication, yoga, or relaxation. This review found evidence of the cost-effectiveness of guideline-recommended treatments of interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for subacute or chronic LBP. There is little or conflicting evidence for other treatments recommended in the guideline.",0,0,
465,Cost-effectiveness of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for drug injectors in the United States,"Background: The health benefits and costs of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the total population of people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States are unclear. Aim: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and optimal delivery conditions of PrEP for PWID. Design: Empirically calibrated dynamic compartment model. Data sources: Published literature and expert opinion. Target population: US adult PWID. Time horizon: 20 years and lifetime. Intervention: PrEP alone, PrEP with frequent screening (PrEP+Screen), and PrEP+Screen with enhanced delivery antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people who become infected (PrEP+Screen+ART). All scenarios are considered with a coverage of 25%. Outcome measures: Infections averted, deaths averted, change in HIV prevalence, discounted costs (in 2015 US dollars), discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Base-case analysis results: PrEP+Screen+ART dominates other strategies, prevents 26,700 infections and reduces HIV prevalence in PWID by 14% compared to status quo. Earning these benefits costs $253,000 per QALY gained. At current drug prices, total PrEP+Screen+ART spending could be as high as $44 billion over 20 years. Sensitivity Analysis Results: The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is linear in the annual cost of PrEP and depends on PrEP medication adherence, individual risk of transmission, and community HIV prevalence. Limitation: US risk stratification data and achievable PrEP efficacy values for PWID are limited Benefits for the US population as a whole, but at current drug prices, it remains an expensive intervention, both in absolute terms and in terms of cost per QALY gained .",0,0,

467,"Costs Associated with the Implementation of a Computerized Clinical Decision Support System for Pregnancy and Maternity Care: Case Study of Kassena-Nankana District, Northern Ghana","AIM: This study analyzed the costs of implementing a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) in selected health centers in Ghana. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Kassena-Nankana District (KND). CDSS was used at selected health centers in KND as an intervention to manage patients attending maternity hospitals and the maternity ward. The CDSS users were mainly registered nurses. Activities and associated costs related to the implementation of CDSS (pre-intervention and intervention) were surveyed for the period 2009-2013 from a provider perspective. The ingredients approach was used for the cost analysis. The costs were divided into personnel costs, training, overhead costs (running costs) and equipment costs (capital costs). We have calculated the cost without annualized cost of capital to show the financial cost and the cost with the annualized cost of capital to show the economic cost. RESULTS: Twenty-two trained CDSS users (minimum 2 users per health center) participated in the study. Between April 2012 and March 2013, users managed 5,595 prenatal clients and 872 labor clients using the CDSS. We observed a decrease in the proportion of complications during childbirth (10.74% before intervention versus 9.64% after intervention) and a reduction in the number of maternal deaths (4 deaths before intervention versus 1 death after the intervention). The total financial cost of the CDSS implementation was $23,316, approximately $1,060 per trained CDSS user. Of the total implementation costs, 48% (US$11,272) was preintervention costs and 52% (US$12,044) was intervention costs. Equipment costs accounted for the largest portion of finance costs: 34% ($7,917). After accounting for economic costs, the total implementation cost was $17,128, 26.5% less than the financial cost. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides useful information in implementing CDSS in health care settings to improve adherence to practice guidelines by health care workers and to make accurate decisions to improve maternal health care.",0,0,
468,"Could a clinical audit improve the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia?","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of the clinical audit to improve the quality of diagnostic care for patients with suspected tuberculosis"";"" and to understand the contextual factors that hinder or facilitate their success. METHODS: Twenty-six health centers in Cuba, Peru and Bolivia were recruited. Clinical audits were introduced to improve diagnostic care for patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The standards were based on WHO and TB program guidelines on the appropriate use of microscopy, culture and radiological examinations. At least two audit cycles have been completed over 2 years. Improvement was determined by comparing performance between two six-month periods before and after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to identify the facilitating and limiting contextual factors influencing the change in clinical behavior of healthcare professionals after the introduction of the clinical audit. RESULTS: We found significant improvement in 11/13 criteria in Cuba, 2/6 criteria in Bolivia, and 2/5 criteria in Peru. Twelve out of 24 audit criteria in all three countries met the agreed standards. Obstacles to quality improvement included conflicting goals for clinicians and TB programs, poor coordination within the healthcare system, and patient attitudes towards disease. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical audit can drive improvements in the quality of clinical care in resource-constrained settings. It is likely to be more effective if integrated with and supported by local TB programs. We recommend the development and evaluation of an integrated quality improvement model including clinical audits.",0,0,
469,Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) study: a multi-step intervention to improve blood pressure control in hypertensive blacks,"Despite strong evidence for effective interventions aimed at controlling blood pressure (BP), there is little evidence for translating these approaches into routine clinical practice in the care of hypertensive Black people. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-stage, multi-component, evidence-based intervention compared to usual care in improving blood pressure control in Black hypertensive patients treated in community health centers. The primary outcomes are the BP control rate at 12 months and maintenance of the intervention at 1 year post-study. The secondary outcomes are the change in blood pressure within the patient from baseline to 12 months and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension (CAATCH) is a randomized group clinical trial with 2 conditions: intervention condition and usual care. Thirty community health centers were randomly assigned to be equally divided into the intervention condition group (n = 15) or usual care group (n = 15). The intervention has 3 components for patients (interactive computer-assisted hypertension education, home blood pressure monitoring, and monthly behavioral counseling for lifestyle changes) and 2 components for physicians (monthly case rounds based on the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment) . hypertension guidelines, reviewing the charts and providing feedback on patients' clinical performance and home blood pressure readings). All results will be evaluated at quarterly study visits for 1 year. Chart review will be performed at 24 months to assess maintenance of intervention effects and sustainability of the intervention. Poor blood pressure control is one of the main reasons for the mortality gap between blacks and whites. The results of this study, if successful, will provide important information needed for the translation and dissemination of evidence-based blood pressure control interventions in clinical practice for this high-risk population.",0,0,

Patients at IC sites received patient education, home blood pressure monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, while physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients' blood pressure readings and chart reviews at home. Patients and physicians at the UC campuses each received printed patient education materials and guidelines for treating hypertension. The primary endpoint was blood pressure control, and the secondary endpoints were mean changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values at 12 months, assessed using an automated blood pressure monitor. A total of 1059 patients (mean age 56 years; 28% male, 59% obese and 36% with diabetes mellitus) were enrolled. Blood pressure control rate was similar in both groups (IC = 49.3% versus UC = 44.5% odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence interval 0.90-1.63] P = 0.21) In predefined subgroup analyses, the intervention associated with better blood pressure control in patients without diabetes mellitus (IC = 54.0% versus UC = 44.7%; odds ratio 1.45 [CI 1.02-2.06]) and small community health centers (IC = 51, 1% vs. UC = 39.6%, odds ratio 1.45 [CI 1.04-2.45]). CONCLUSIONS: A practice-based multicomponent intervention was no better than CU in improving blood pressure control in hypertensive Blacks. Future research on implementing behavior modification strategies to control hypertension in resource-constrained settings should focus on developing more efficient and tailored interventions in this high-risk population.

471,"Building a sustainable, interprofessional team training program: first results","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this program evaluation was to investigate whether incorporating conscious learning concepts through the use of simulated patient scenarios to teach interprofessional collaboration skills to a healthcare team on an acute hospital unit would improve resuscitation response in the first 5 minutes on this device. DESIGN/SETTING: This was a pilot program evaluation using a department-based clinical nursing specialist in the delivery of an interprofessional training program that included a simulation in an acute medical care unit in a large tertiary care hospital. EXAMPLE: 84 employees took part in 17 simulations. The sample included first-year internists, registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and patient care technicians. METHODS: This was a program assessment using the TeamSTEPPS Teamwork Perceptions Questionnaire (T-TPQ) (Classroom Slides: TeamSTEPPS Essentials""; http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/education/curriculum-tools/teamstepps/instructor /essentials/slessentials.html#s3) during the pre-simulation/post-simulation sessions to assess participants' perceptions of teamwork Expected intervention behaviors were captured through participant observations of the simulations and compared to American Heart Association guidelines (Circulation 2010 ;122:S685-S670, S235-S337). Common perceptions of participants regarding the experience were obtained through open-ended assessment questions. RESULTS: Fifty-three participants completed the pre- and post-T-TPQ. Average scores in the leadership category of T-TPQ decreased significantly (P=0.003) from pretest (median 2.167) to T-TPQ posttest (median 2.566) Only 35% of groups administered during the crest defibrillation simulation scenario, and only 1 group delivered this shock within the American Heart Association recommended time frame of 2 minutes (Circulation 2010;""122:S235-S337). CONCLUSION: A single resuscitation simulation was not enough intervention dose for the staff to improve the resuscitation process. A longitudinal study should be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program after employees have repeated the program several times. IMPLICATIONS: A department-based simulation training program for quality improvement could help improve staff's first 5-minute reaction and resuscitation skills by increasing the frequency of department-based training overseen by the department's clinical nurse.",0,0,
472,Creating spaces in intensive care medicine for safe communication: a video-reflexive ethnographic study,"Background The physical environment in acute care is a new focus in patient safety research, with few studies primarily focusing on the design of ward environments and the placement and selection of physical objects such as lighting fixtures and hand basins. Methods We report an interventionist video-reflexive ethnographic (AER) study that examined how clinicians used the built environment to achieve secure communication in an intensive care unit (ICU) in a Sydney metropolitan hospital. We conducted 40 semi-structured interviews, 5 weeks of observation, and four reflective focus groups with a total of 87 participants (including medical, nursing, allied health, and office workers). Results We found that staff and patient accessibility in the open areas of the ICU was both a safety feature and a safety hazard, as it allowed for a safe flow of communication but also allowed for potentially unsafe interruptions. Staff managed disruptions while allowing a safe level of accessibility by creating temporary sheltered spaces, using physical markers such as curtains, tape and signs, as well as behavioral cues, movement and developing policies that limit activity in specific areas. In addition, clinicians could use the VRE method to gain insights into their own practices and problems, and to develop meaningful solutions to other problem areas. Conclusions ICU staff enable safe communication within their wards by creating temporary spaces that are both 'connected' and 'protected'. The flexibility of these “soft” strategies lends itself particularly well to the fast-paced clinical context of critical care.",0,0,

474,Cueing from prenatal providers impacts discussions about intimate partner violence,"BACKGROUND: Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy poses a significant health risk to both the mother and the developing fetus. Practice guidelines recommend that prenatal providers evaluate and counsel their patients about IPV, but many physicians express reluctance or uneasiness about such discussions . The Health in Pregnancy (HIP) computer program was developed to improve the counseling of prenatal providers on behavioral risks. METHODS: English-speaking women 18 years and older who were less than 26 weeks pregnant and received prenatal care at one of five participating San Francisco-area clinics were randomized into parallel groups in a controlled study (since June 2006). ;"" Data analyzed June 2007). Participants who reported one or more risks were randomized to intervention or control in stratified blocks. Providers received summary cueing sheets alerting them to their patients' risks and advice on counseling RESULTS: Thirteen percent (37/286) of the sample reported current IPV Provider cueing resulted in 85% of the IPV intervention group reporting conversations with their provider compared to 23.5% of the control group (p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: IPV discussions have been strongly influenced by cueing providers Provider cueing is an effective and appropriate adjunct to routine risk counseling in prenatal care.",0,0,
475,Cultivating a learning culture in primary care practice: an educational intervention,"BACKGROUND: Primary care faces increasing challenges, including the rise of chronic diseases and their management in the community. This paper describes an educational initiative designed to help local General Practitioners (GPs) and primary care teams manage chronic conditions and address referral behavior. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initiative by examining the experiences of participants and providers. METHODS: A variety of methods were used to collect data for analysis. This included feedback from participants in the form of workshop evaluation questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with participants and speakers, and focus groups with participants. RESULTS: After analyzing the data, five themes were identified across all methods used. This paper focuses on the key issues of practice change and referral behavior as they relate to the specific objectives of the initiative. The data showed that after participating in the educational initiative, participants had experienced actual changes in practice, including changes in individual practice and prescribing behavior, as well as in community health care delivery. The changes observed in referral behavior were evident in the feedback from both participants and speakers in secondary care. Participants noted proposed changes, including an expected reduction in dermatology referrals through better management of primary care conditions, as well as greater awareness of indications for early referral. The use of guidelines to support referral decisions was identified, and the content and information required in referral letters was also a key area. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of this educational initiative has identified changes in practice in primary care and shows how educational interventions can support and improve future developments in primary care.",0,0,
476,Culturally Tailored Chronic Disease Interventions Targeted at Korean Americans: A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVE: As little is known about promising interventions for the prevention and control of chronic diseases in Korean Americans, we conducted a systematic literature review to examine: (1) theoretical frameworks and strategies used by interventions for Korean Americans; (2) cultural factors considered by these interventions;' and (3) the extent of their success in engaging Korean participants and improving their health. DESIGN: Following PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science were searched to identify primary research articles evaluating chronic disease prevention or control interventions tailored to Korean Americans and published from 1980 to 2011. Of 238 identified items, 21 items describing 16 unique intervention tests met the inclusion criteria. These interventions targeted cancer (10), hypertension (2), diabetes (1), mental health (1), tobacco cessation (1), and general health (1). RESULTS: All included studies were published since 2000, reflecting the relatively recent establishment of intervention research involving Korean Americans. All 16 programs delivered linguistically appropriate messages and education. The 11 programs that achieved significant intervention effects also provided or coordinated social support from culturally relevant and well-trained medical laypersons, nurses, or family members during an intervention and/or follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate and linguistically appropriate messaging and education may not be sufficient to prevent or control chronic diseases among immigrant Korean Americans. Culturally sensitive and engaged social support should be provided to catalyze behavior change and sustain the impact of the interventions.",0,0,
477,"Current management of transitional feeding issues in preterm infants born in Queensland, Australia","BACKGROUND: Many preterm infants have difficulty developing their suckling skills in the weeks following birth. Ineffective management of transitional feeding issues can lead to patient complications and contribute to a longer length of stay. OBJECTIVES: Recognizing that many neonatal nurseries appear to have different practices in dealing with newborn feeding, the aim of this study was to investigate and document the routine level of support and intervention currently available for preterm infants with transitional feeding problems at the different Level II (special care) Nurserys (SCNs) in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to all Queensland SCNs in 2005 (n=36). The questionnaire contained a series of closed-choice, short-answer questions aimed at gathering information from each SCN on their current practices in dealing with transitional feeding issues in preterm infants. The results were confirmed during a subsequent phone call. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 29 SCNs (80.6%). None of these daycares reported having formal, written policies for managing transitional feeding issues in preterm infants. Large differences were reported in terms of suction feeding assessments and interventions used by staff in the different SCNs. Of the 29 day care centers, 4 (13.8%) reported using checklists or ratings to assess willingness to suck, and 5 (17.2%) reported using pulse oximetry to assess acceptability of attempts to suck. Eighteen SCNs (62.1%) reported providing some form of active intervention to help newborns with transitional feeding problems, with the most common intervention techniques reported being non-nutritional sucking during tube feeding, oral stimulation prior to feeding, and active stimulation of suckling formulas . Twenty-two SCNs (75.4%) reported having access to a lactation consultant to help mothers with breastfeeding challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in routine management of transitional feeding problems in preterm infants have been reported across Queensland SCNs. It is suggested that evidence-based guidelines need to be developed and that this requires further research studies to identify current best practices and to answer remaining questions.",0,0,
478,Current patterns and future directions in the treatment of insomnia,"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence and burden of chronic insomnia, it remains largely unrecognized by physicians and often undertreated. METHODS: A literature review was conducted on barriers to acute and chronic management of insomnia and current studies of pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents for insomnia. RESULTS: Barriers to adequate management of the condition include outdated guidelines for treating insomnia, which have contributed to U.S. Food and Drug Administration restrictions on long-term prescribing of hypnotics; lack of research demonstrating the benefits of treating insomnia; and fears of tolerance and withdrawal effects from long-term use of hypnotics, and the lack of longer-term, randomized, double-blind, controlled trials of existing agents for the treatment of insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that improved sleep may improve outcome in some medical and psychiatric disorders. Both behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been shown to be effective for chronic insomnia. In addition, a recent 6-month randomized controlled trial demonstrated that at least one active ingredient may be safe and effective with long-term use.",0,0,
479,Restricting the ordering of laboratory tests in a managed care environment by redesigning a computerized order form,"OBJECTIVE: To increase the appropriate use of blood tests for folic acid and vitamin B12 ordered by primary care physicians in a managed care organization in Israel by redesigning a computerized order form. STUDY DESIGN: Pre-post-intervention. METHODS: A new version of the computerized order form was introduced. Utilization patterns were calculated for tests of vitamin B12, folic acid and ferritin, which were summarized earlier. Concomitant application patterns for hemoglobin and iron tests were evaluated as controls. RESULTS: Testing ordered for the 3 objectives decreased by 31% to 41% compared to the month before the intervention, with a further decrease to 36% to 53% the following month. In controls (-2% to 3%), negligible changes in usage patterns were observed during the post-intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: Simply restructuring a computerized order form significantly reduced the number of laboratory tests suspected of being unnecessary or redundant. If overuse of laboratory resources is suspected, managers should evaluate the effectiveness of the organization's current ordering processes before conducting resource-intensive interventions.",1,1,
480,Kutane maligne Lymphome: Update 2006,"Cutaneous lymphomas represent a unique group of lymphomas and are the second most common extranodal lymphomas. As with other neoplasms, the pathogenesis is mainly based on a stepwise accumulation of mutations of suppressor genes and oncogenes caused by genetic, environmental or infectious factors. The diagnosis includes clinical, histological, imaging and haematological examinations as well as in many cases immunohistochemical and molecular biological analyses. The current WHO/EORTC classification of cutaneous lymphomas distinguishes between “mature T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas”, “mature B-cell lymphomas” and “immature hematopoietic malignancies”, their variants and subgroups. It is compatible with the WHO classification for neoplasms of hematopoietic and lymphatic tissue and takes into account the organ-specific characteristics of primarily cutaneous lymphomas. The classification of the different types of cutaneous lymphoma into prognostic categories (prelymphomatous ""abortive"" diseases"", ""definitely malignant lymphomas of low-grade malignancy"", ""definitely malignant lymphomas of high-grade malignancy"") provides essential information about the biological behavior and allows for appropriate planning of the therapeutic strategy, which may be topical or systemic and aggressive or non-aggressive.

METHODS: A prospective two-arm randomized controlled pilot study. Patients with osteoarthritis were eligible if they understood English and were referred to a Canadian orthopedic joint testing clinic for a surgical consultation for an initial total knee arthroplasty. Patients were randomized to PtDA intervention or usual education. The intervention consisted of an osteoarthritis PtDA for patients and a one-page preference report summarizing the patients' clinical and decision data for their surgeon. The main feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and questionnaire completion; the preliminary efficacy outcomes were latency and decision quality 71) or usual training (n=71). Data collection revealed a questionnaire completion rate of 93% with less than 1% missing items. After one year, 13% of patients remained on the surgical waiting list. The mean time from referral to waitlist appearance (censored using survival analysis techniques) was 33.4 weeks for the PtDA group (n=69, 95% CI: 26.0, 41.4) and 33.0 weeks for usual education (n=71, 95% CI: 26.1, 39.9) Patients exposed to PtDA had higher decision quality based on knowledge (71% vs. 47%; p<0.0001) , and the quality decision was an informed decision consistent with their values for option outcomes (56.4% vs. 25.0%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of patients with osteoarthritis considering surgery and data collection was feasible. Since some patients were still on the surgical waiting list after one year, the follow-up should be extended to two years. Patients exposed to PtDA achieved higher decision quality compared to those who received usual training, but there was no difference in waiting time before surgery.

483,Decision-making in the surgical management of chronic low back pain: the performance of prognostic tests to select patients for lumbar spinal fusion,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the leading causes of disability in the western world with an enormous economic burden on society. To date, no specific underlying anatomical cause of CLBP has been identified. Imaging often reveals degenerative findings in the disc or facet joints of one or more lumbar motion segments. However, these findings can also be observed in asymptomatic individuals. It has been suggested that pain in degenerated discs may be caused by nerve fiber ingrowth into cracks or fissures of the annulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus and by reported high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Since this so-called discogenic pain is often intensified by mechanical stress, the concept of pain relief through spinal fusion to stabilize a painful section of the spine was developed. Lumbar spine fusion is actually beneficial for some patients, but its results vary widely and are difficult to predict for the individual patient. To identify those CLBP patients who will benefit from fusion, many surgeons rely on tests that are believed to predict the outcome of spinal fusion. The three most commonly used prognostic tests in daily practice are immobilization in a lumbosacral orthosis, provocative discography, and trial immobilization with temporary external transpedicular fixation. In order to reach a consensus on the indications for lumbar fusion and to improve its outcomes through better patient selection, it is important to understand the role and value of these prognostic tests for CLBP patients in clinical practice. The overall objectives of the present work were: 1) to assess whether there is a consensus among spinal surgeons on the use and appreciation of prognostic tests for lumbar spinal fusion; 2) to verify that a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) truly minimizes lumbosacral motion; 3) to verify whether a TLSO can predict the clinical outcome of fusion for CLBP; 4) to assess whether the provocative discography of adjacent segments actually predicts the long-term clinical outcome of the fusion; 5) to determine the incidence of postdiscographic discitis, and whether there is one, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is required; 6) to assess whether temporary external transpedicular fixation (TETF) can help predict spinal fusion outcome;"" 7) to determine the prognostic accuracy of the most commonly used tests in clinical practice to assess fusion outcome for CLBP The results of a national survey of spinal surgeons in the Netherlands were presented in Study I. Surgeons were asked for their opinions on prognostic factors and the use of predictive tests for lumbar fusion in CLBP patients.The comments were combined with findings from the compared to current literature. The survey revealed a significant lack of uniformity in the use and appreciation of predictive tests. Also, prognostic factors known from the literature were not consistently included in the decision-making process of the surgeons. This heterogeneity in strategy is most likely explained by the lack of sol ider of scientific evidence for current predictive testing, and it was concluded that there is currently insufficient consensus among spinal surgeons in the Netherlands to establish national guidelines for surgical decision making in CLBP. In study II, the hypothetical mechanism of action of a pantaloon cast (ie, minimizing lumbosacral joint mobility) was investigated. In patients admitted for a temporary external transpedicular fixation test (TETF), infrared light markers were rigidly attached to the prominent ends of Steinman pins, which were fixed in two spinal planes. In this way, three-dimensional movements between these planes could be analyzed optoelectronically. Under dynamic test conditions such as walking, a cast, either with or without unilateral hip fixation, did not significantly reduce lumbosacral joint motion. Although not supported by sound scientific evidence, lumbosacral orthotics or pantaloon casts are commonly used in daily practice as a predictor of fusion outcome. A systematic literature review supplemented by a prospective cohort study was performed (Study III) to assess the value of a Pantaloon cast for surgical decision making. It was shown that only in CLBP patients without prior spinal surgery does a pantaloon cast test with significant pain relief indicate a favorable outcome of lumbar fusion compared to conservative treatment. The test is worthless in patients who have had previous spinal surgery. Many spine surgeons believe that provocative discography, as opposed to simple X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, is a physiological test that can truly determine whether a disc is painful and relevant to a patient's pain syndrome, regardless of disc morphology. It has been suggested that in order to achieve a successful clinical outcome of lumbar fusion, suspect discs should be painful and adjacent control discs should not cause pain on provocative discography. Therefore, in study IV, a cohort of patients in whom the decision to perform lumbar fusion was based on an external fixation study (TETF) was analyzed retrospectively. The results of the preoperative discography excluding the planes adjacent to the fusion were compared with the clinical results after spinal fusion. It was shown that in this selected group of patients, the discographic status of intervertebral discs in addition to lumbar fusion had no influence on the clinical outcome. The most feared complication of lumbar discography is discitis. Although the incidence is low, it represents a serious complication for a diagnostic procedure and prevention through the use of prophylactic antibiotics has been advocated. In search of clinical guidelines, the risk of discitis was assessed according to the discography in study V using a systematic literature review and a cohort of 200 consecutive patients. Without the use of prophylactic antibiotics, an overall incidence of postdiscographic discitis of 0.25% was found. To prove that antibiotics would actually prevent discitis would require a randomized trial of 9,000 patients to be meaningful. Given the potential adverse effects of antibiotics, it was concluded that routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in lumbar discography is not indicated. In study VI, the medium and long-term results of external fixation (TETF) were evaluated as a test to predict the clinical outcome of lumbar fusion in a cohort of low back pain patients in whom the indication for surgery was in doubt. The test included a placebo study in which patients did not know whether the lumbar segment planes were fixed or dynamized. Using rigorous and objective criteria of pain reduction on a visual analog scale, the TETF test failed to predict the clinical outcome of fusion in this selected patient population. Pin track infections and nerve root irritations were recorded as complications of this invasive test. It was concluded that in patients with chronic low back pain and doubtful indication for fusion, TETF is not recommended as an additional tool for surgical decision-making. In Study VII, a systematic literature review was performed regarding the prognostic accuracy of tests currently used in clinical practice that are believed to predict the outcome of lumbar spinal fusion in CLBP. The tests of interest were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TLSO immobilization, TETF, provocative discography, and facet joint infiltration. Only 10 studies could be selected that reported on three different index tests (discography, TLSO immobilization and TETF) that actually reported on test qualifications such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio. The accuracy of all prognostic tests was found to be low, confirming that in many clinical practices, patients are scheduled for fusion based on tests with insufficient or, at best, unknown accuracy. Since the overall methodological quality of the included studies was poor, higher quality studies are needed that include both negative and positive patients for fusion. It was concluded that the current best evidence does not support the use of a prognostic test in clinical practice. No subgroup of patients with back pain could be identified for whom spinal fusion is a reliable and effective treatment. Several studies in the literature have reported that cognitive behavioral therapy or intensive exercise programs have similar outcomes to spinal fusion, but with significantly fewer complications, morbidity, and costs. Because the results of the present work show that the tests currently used do not improve fusion outcomes through better patient selection, these tests should not be recommended for surgical decision-making in standard of care. Additionally, spinal fusion should not be suggested as a standard treatment for chronic low back pain. The causality of non-specific spinal pain is complex and CLBP should not be considered as a diagnosis but rather as a symptom in patients with varying degrees of impairment and disability. Patients should be evaluated in a multidisciplinary setting or spine center according to the so-called biopsychosocial model, which aims to identify underlying psychosocial factors as well as biological factors. Treatment should be gradual, beginning with the least invasive treatment. CLBP's current approach, which places an emphasis on self-management and patient empowerment for active treatment to prevent long-term disability and chronicity, is recommended.",0,0,

487,Default settings of the physician's computerized order entry system determine order habits.,"Background: Physician Computer Assisted Order Entry (CPOE) systems are fast becoming ubiquitous, and sets of orders (“order sets”) to allow for easy order entry is a common feature. This provides a streamlined mechanism for viewing, modifying, and placing groups of related orders. This often serves as the electronic equivalent of a subject requirement. A feature of these job sets is that certain jobs can be predetermined as ""preselected"" or ""default"" whenever the job set is used, while others are ""optional"" or ""default"" (although there's usually an option to default to “disable” enabled tests in a given situation.While it seems intuitive that the default settings in an order set are often accepted, additional studies are needed to understand the impact of these “default” settings in an order set on ordering habits Study was to quantify the effect of changing the default settings of an order set.Methods: For the purpose of quality improvement, transfusion order sets were recently reviewed and modified to improve outcome monitoring.Initially, the default setting for post-transfusion hematocrit values was changed and changed the platelet count from ""optional"" to ""preselected"". The default platelet count settings were later changed back to ""optional"" to allow a natural experiment to examine the effect of default selection of an order set on physician ordering habits. RESULTS: Post-transfusion hematocrit values were ordered for 8.3% of RBC transfusions when the default choice for the sequence set was ""Off"" and for 57.4% of transfusions when the default choice was ""preselect"" (P < 0.0001). Post-transfusion platelet counts were ordered for 7.0% of platelet transfusions when the initial selection of the default order set was ""optional"", increased to 59.4% when the default was changed to ""preselected"" (P < 0.0001), and then reduced to 7.5% when the default choice was reset to optional. Post-transfusion platelet count rates during the two ""optional"" periods: 7.0% versus 7.5% - were not statistically different (P=0.620). Discussion: Default settings in CPOE prescription records can significantly affect physician selection of laboratory tests. Careful consideration should be given to all stakeholders, including clinicians and pathologists, when setting default settings in order sets.",1,1,
488,Defensive medicine among high-risk specialists in a volatile malpractice environment,"Initial situation How often doctors change their treatment behavior because of the threat of liability for medical errors, so-called defensive medicine, and what the consequences of these changes are, are central questions in the ongoing debate on the reform of medical liability. Objective To study the prevalence and characteristics of defensive medicine among physicians practicing in high liability specialties during a period of significant instability in the malpractice environment. Design, Setting, and Participants Mail survey of physicians in 6 high-risk litigation specialties (emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology) in Pennsylvania in May 2003. Main Outcome Measures Number of physicians in each specialty involving defense medicine or changes reported in the area of application and in characteristics of defensive medicine (safety and avoidance behavior). Results A total of 824 physicians (65%) took part in the survey. Almost all (93%) reported practicing defensive medicine. ""Reassurance behaviors"" such as ordering tests, performing diagnostic procedures, and referring patients for consultation were very common (92%). Of those defensive medicine practitioners who detailed their last line of defense, 43% reported using imaging technology in clinically unnecessary circumstances. Avoiding procedures and patients that were thought to increase the likelihood of litigation was also widespread. Forty-two percent of those surveyed said they had taken steps to limit their practice in the past three years, including eliminating complication-prone procedures like trauma surgery and avoiding patients who had complex medical problems or were perceived as contentious. Defensive behavior was strongly correlated with respondents' lack of confidence in their liability insurance and perceived burden of insurance premiums. Conclusion Defensive medicine is prevalent among Pennsylvania physicians, who pay the most for liability insurance, with potentially serious implications for cost, access, and both the technical and interpersonal quality of care.",0,0,
489,Determining the optimal treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease,"Despite the growing recognition that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global public health and social care crisis, diagnosis is often slow and many patients are still not receiving treatment at all. Of those receiving treatment, many remain on a lower-than-recommended dose. The Alzheimer's disease International Global Charter promotes awareness and understanding of AD and emphasizes the importance of optimal treatment. However, the definition of “optimal treatment” is unclear. Since cholinesterase inhibitors became available nearly 20 years ago, clinicians have developed a variety of protocols based on clinical experience. This review considers what is optimal for different aspects of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, considering initiation strategies, dosages, modes of drug delivery (eg, oral vs. transdermal), and duration of treatment. Regardless of the treatment approach, people with AD, their families and caregivers have a right to timely diagnosis and access to the best treatment available.",0,0,
490,Delivery of good childcare: a look in the door,"AIM: To describe the provision of quality childcare and its components; to compare this performance to the recommendations in Bright Futures and to compare the provision of quality childcare for children with special health needs to that for children without special needs. METHODS: Over a 10-week period, 2 medical students observed and documented the characteristics of childcare visits by general pediatricians and mid-level pediatric specialists. Parents completed a demographic questionnaire and a children with special health needs screener. RESULTS: 483 total Visits from 43 pediatricians and 9 medium-sized providers with patients aged 0-19 years were observed Adjusted mean visit length was 20.3 minutes 38.9% of visits began with an open-ended parent/child question 7.2 Health monitoring/ Predictive counseling was covered at each visit. Clinicians covered an average of 42% of Bright Futures recommended age-specific health monitoring/anticipatory guides. Topics addressed less frequently than recommended were family support, parental wellbeing, behavior/discipline, physical activity, media screen time, risk reduction/substance use, puberty/sex, social interactions with peers, and violence. Shorter visits were associated with asking questions about parent/child concerns and addressing a greater proportion of recommended health surveillance/predictive counseling topics. Visits to child day care for children with special health needs were 36% longer than for children without special needs and addressed a similar amount of age-specific health monitoring/proactive counseling issues. More time was spent with children with special health needs to address issues of health monitoring/predictive counselling, other conditions (usually their chronic condition) and testing, prescriptions and referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Through direct observation of pediatrician visits, we found that parent/child concerns were raised less frequently than recommended. Less than half of the recommended visit-specific health monitoring/predictive counseling topics were addressed, and there was little agreement with some of Bright Futures' age group-specific recommendations. Notably, both seeking patient/parent concerns and greater adherence to health surveillance/predictive guidance recommendations were associated with shorter visits. Visits to child day care for children with special health needs were longer than for children without special needs; more time was spent addressing a similar number of health monitoring/predictive counseling issues and their chronic conditions.",0,0,
491,Demand management for planned care: a realistic synthesis.,"Â The task of matching fluctuating demand with available capacity is one of the fundamental challenges in any major service industry. This is a particularly pressing issue in modern healthcare systems, as increasing demand (aging populations, availability of new treatments, expanding patient knowledge, etc.) meets stagnant supply (capacity and funding constraints for staff and services, etc.). As a result, a very large portfolio of demand management strategies has evolved, based on wildly different assumptions about the cause of the problem and the means to solve it. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of key strategies for mitigating demand pressures in the planned supply space. The study starts with an overview of the most important ideas on the genesis of demand and capacity problems for health services. Many different diagnoses were uncovered: 'fluctuating demand meets inpatient capacity', 'territory protection' between different providers, social rather than clinical pressures on referral decisions, self-propelling diagnostic cascades, supplier-induced demand, demographic pressures on treatment and the informed patient, and demand inflation. We then conducted a review of the key ideas (program theories) underlying interventions designed to address demand imbalances.We found that there was not a close correspondence between alleged problems and advocated solutions.Demand management interventions take their starting point from the Searching for reforms at the levels of strategic decision-making, organizational restructuring, procedural modifications, and behavioral change In capturing reform ideas, we also identified a trend enz states that program theories are becoming “whole system” models, which policymakers have advocated over time The need for concerted action on all these fronts The remainder and core of the report provides a realistic summary of the empirical evidence of effectiveness on a broad subset of four major demand management activities: Referral Management Centers (RMCs); Employing Special Interest GPs (GPwSIs) at the interface between primary and secondary care; General Practitioner (GP) direct access to clinical tests; and referral policies. In all cases we encountered a colorful pattern of success and failure. The primary literature is replete with reports of unexpected problems and unintended effects. These programs only ""work"" under very limited conditions. To give just one brief example, we have found that the success of RMCs depends critically on the balance of control in their governance structures; GPwSIs only affect demand after close negotiations on an agreed and intermediate case mix; Direct access to testing by GPs leads to significant efficiencies, especially when diagnostic results are low and exclusion rates high.” and referral policies are more likely to work when implemented by staff who are responsible for their creation. The report concludes that there is no ""preferred intervention"" that can outperform all others. Instead, the review found many different, hard-won, local and adaptive solutions. Regardless of the starting point, the success of demand management depends on synchronizing a complex set of strategic interventions, organisational, procedural and motivational changes. The final chapter offers practitioners guidance on how to 'think through' all the interdependencies that balance demand and capacity. A detailed analysis of the implementation of different configurations of demand management interventions in different localities Mixed-methods contexts would be valuable in understanding the processes by which such interventions are tailored to local circumstances.There is also scope for further evidence synthesis d Welfare ubiquitous, and a realistic synthesis to compare the fortunes of different practitioners at different professional boundaries (eg. (e.g. nurses/doctors, dentists/dentists, radiologists/radiologists, etc.) would be valuable to identify the contexts and mechanisms through which substitution, support or short-circuit occurs.

492,Dementia care management: Breaking new ground in outpatient dementia care as part of a general practitioner randomized controlled intervention study,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of dementia is a major challenge for the German healthcare system. The aim of the DelpHi-MV study (“Dementia: Life and person-centred help in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania”) is to implement and evaluate an innovative subsidiary support system for people with dementia living at home and their caring relatives. METHODS: DelpHi-MV is a GP-based cluster randomized controlled intervention study. The aim of the DelpHi intervention is ""optimal care"" through the integration of multi-professional and multi-modal strategies for the individualization and optimization of dementia treatment within the established health and social system. The intervention is delivered in people's homes by Dementia Care Managers (DCMs) - nurses with dementia-specific training. Based on the German guidelines for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of dementia, a comprehensive set of 95 intervention modules - the ""DelpHi standard"" - was defined. Each module consists of predefined trigger condition(s), a subsequent intervention task and at least one criterion for its completion. The intervention begins with a comprehensive inventory of the care situation, needs and resources. In close cooperation with the general practitioner, the DCM develops and implements an intervention plan tailored to the individual circumstances. EXPECTED RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We expect statistically significant differences between the control and intervention groups on the primary endpoints (quality of life, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, pharmacotherapy, caregiver burden). The results can provide evidence of the effectiveness and effectiveness of dementia care management according to the ""Delphi standard"" - prerequisites for the implementation of this concept in everyday care.",0,0,

494,Creation and distribution of the MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans,"BACKGROUND: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) practitioners identified comprehensive weight management as a high priority in early 2001. PROGRAM DESIGN: The MOVE! The Veteran's Weight Management Program was developed based on published guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and other organizations. The feasibility of the program was tested at 17 VHA sites and the program was refined during early implementation in 2005. DISTRIBUTION: MOVE! was distributed nationwide in January 2006. Local program coordinators and physician champions were appointed, and toolkits, online training, marketing materials and ongoing on-site support were provided. RATING: MOVE! has been implemented in almost all medical centers of the VHA. By June 2008, more than 100,000 patients had taken part in MOVE! with more than 500,000 visits. An assessment based on an established framework is ongoing. CONCLUSION: MOVE! is an example of the large-scale translation of research into practice. It has the potential to reduce the burden of disease from obesity and related diseases.",0,0,
495,Design and evaluation of a computer reminder system to improve the prescribing behavior of general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a decision support system using reactive computer reminders to improve drug prescribing behavior. Methods: A clustered RCT with an incomplete block design was conducted in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs received reminders for antibiotics and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs received reminders for cholesterol prescriptions. The prescription guidelines were integrated into the general practitioner information system that was installed in the general practitioners' practices of the intervention group. When the computer program was used, a reminder appeared if the GP deviated from the guidelines during the prescription. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Prescribing according to guidelines as a percentage of total prescriptions for a given drug. In addition, an evaluation of the user-friendliness of the CRS in general practice was carried out using questionnaires and interviews. RESULTS: Analyzes are currently being performed. Preliminary results show that the CRS study has confirmed our expectations. In general, the number of prescriptions seems to have decreased, following the recommendations of the computerized guidelines not to prescribe certain drugs. The final analysis will be carried out shortly. In general, the Computer Reminder System was perceived as stable and user-friendly. CONCLUSION: We have created a stable and user-friendly computer reminder system, adapted to the needs and requirements of GPs. Preliminary results on the effectiveness of the system seem to indicate that implementing a computer reminder system with reactive reminders improves drug prescribing behavior.",0,1,
496,Conception and implementation of training courses to improve the handling of pediatric obesity,"INTRODUCTION: Clinicians report low levels of proficiency in treating obese children and using behavior management strategies. This paper documents the design and implementation of a training program to improve physicians' skills in the assessment and behavioral management of pediatric obesity. METHODS: Two one-hour CME training courses were designed using published guidelines, research, and expert panel recommendations. The training was offered to clinicians in a managed care pediatric unit using novel screening and counseling tools and interactive exercises. Surveys and focus groups were conducted 3 and 6 months after the intervention to examine physicians' attitudes and practices regarding screening and counseling tools. RESULTS: After the intervention, the majority of clinicians agreed that the clinical practice guidelines (Resource for Pediatric Obesity Practice) and the BMI for the age percentiles provided useful information for clinical practice. Clinicians reported increased use of the recommended screening tools and changes in practice to implement these tools. They offered suggestions on how to improve the usability of the tools and how to overcome perceived barriers for physicians and/or patients. DISCUSSION: A short, low-cost, multi-faceted training and the provision of counseling tools were found helpful for clinical practice. Useful lessons were learned about tool design and methods of putting tools into practice. Training the entire healthcare team is beneficial for adopting new tools and practices.",0,0,
497,"Echo WISELY (Will Inappropriate Echocardiography Scenarios Reduce Significance) Study Design and Methods: An Investigator-Blinded, Randomized, Controlled Study of Education and Feedback Intervention to Reduce Inappropriate Echocardiograms","BACKGROUND: Appropriate use criteria (AUC) for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were developed to address concerns about inappropriate use of TTE. A previous pilot study suggests that an education and feedback intervention can reduce inappropriate TTEs ordered by trainee physicians. It is unknown whether this type of intervention is effective when targeted to treating physicians in a variety of clinical settings. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this international, multicenter study is to test the hypothesis that an AUC-based education and feedback intervention reduces the rate of inappropriate echocardiograms ordered by treating physicians in the outpatient setting. METHODS: Cardiologists and primary care physicians practicing in the outpatient setting are enrolled in an ongoing multicenter, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial in Canada and the United States. The intervention arm will receive (1) a lecture detailing AUC and the latest available evidence on the appropriate use of TTE, (2) access to the American Society of Echocardiography mobile phone app, and (3) individualized feedback reports that are provided monthly TTE order behavior including reference to inappropriate TTEs and brief explanations of the inappropriate designation are summarized by e-mail. The control group does not receive education on the appropriate use of TTE and orders TTEs as usual. CONCLUSIONS: The Echo WISELY study (Will Inadequate Scenarios for Echocardiography Lessen Significantly in an Education RCT) is the first multicenter randomized study of an AUC-based educational intervention. The study will examine whether an education and feedback intervention will reduce the rate of inappropriate outpatient TTEs ordered by treating cardiologists and primary care physicians (www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT02038101).",0,0,
498,Design factors for the success or failure of guideline-based decision support systems: a case complexity hypothesis,"Computer-based decision support systems (CDSSs) are currently mostly memory systems. However, the effectiveness of such systems in modifying physician behavior is not always observed. We believe that this approach is appropriate when physicians think they know how to prescribe and feel they do not need help, ie for simple clinical cases. In contrast, on-demand approaches that allow flexibility in interpreting the patient's condition are more appropriate for more complex cases, e.g. B. in the treatment of chronic diseases. ASTI is a CDSS that operates in two modes, a critique mode that operates as a memory-based system and a user-initiated guidance mode. Using a clinical case complexity score, a pre/post-intervention experiment was conducted with 10 general practitioners and 15 cases of hypertensive patients. Preliminary results tend to indicate that memory-based interaction is appropriate for simple cases and that physicians are willing to use on-demand systems when clinical situations become more complex, making both modes complementary.",1,1,

500,"Conception of the Balance@Work project: systematic development, evaluation and implementation of an occupational health guideline for the prevention of weight gain in employees","BACKGROUND: Occupational health professionals can play an important role in preventive health promotion activities for employees. However, due to a lack of knowledge and evidence- and practice-based methods and strategies, interventions have so far hardly been implemented by occupational physicians. The aim of the Balance@Work project is to develop, evaluate and implement occupational health and safety guidelines to prevent employees from gaining weight. METHODS: Following the guideline development protocol of the Dutch Society for Occupational Medicine and the intervention mapping protocol, the guideline was developed on the basis of literature, interviews with relevant stakeholders and consensus of an expert group. The guide consists of a personal and an environmental component. The individual component provides recommendations for occupational health professionals to promote physical activity and healthy eating habits based on motivational interviewing principles. The environmental component includes a tool for assessing the obesogenic environment. The guideline will be evaluated in a randomized controlled study among 20 occupational physicians. Occupational physicians in the intervention group apply the guideline to eligible employees for 6 months. Occupational physicians in the control group provide care as usual. The measurements take place at the beginning of the study and 6, 12 and 18 months afterwards. The primary target parameters include waist circumference, daily physical activity and eating habits. Secondary outcome parameters include physical inactivity, determinants of behavior change, body weight and body mass index, cardiovascular disease risk profile, and quality of life. In addition, productivity, absenteeism and profitability are evaluated. DISCUSSION: Improving workers' daily physical activity and dietary habits can prevent weight gain and subsequently improve workers' health, increase productivity and reduce absenteeism. After an impact and process evaluation, the guideline will be adjusted and published after approval. Together with several implementation aids, the published guideline is widely disseminated by the Dutch Society for Occupational Medicine. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN73545254/NTR1190.",0,0,
501,"Design, implementation, and evaluation of a knowledge translation intervention to increase organ donation after cardiovascular death in Canada: a study protocol","Background The shortage of transplantable organs is a global problem. There are two types of organ donation: living and deceased. Organ donation from the deceased can occur after a neurological determination of death (NDD) or a cardiac death. Cardiocirculatory death (DCD) donation accounts for the largest increase in organ donation from the deceased worldwide. However, differences in the use of DCD exist within Canada and around the world. The reasons for these discrepancies are largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a theory-based knowledge translation intervention to provide practical guidance on how to increase the number of DCD organ donors without decreasing the number of standard NDD donors. Methods We will use a three-step, mixed-methods approach. In step one, we conduct semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify and describe stakeholders' beliefs and attitudes towards DCD and their perceptions of the multi-level factors influencing DCD. We will identify: determinants of the evidence-practice gap, specific behavioral changes and/or process changes required to increase DCD, specific groups of clinicians or organizations (e.g., provincial-level donor organizations) that require behavioral change. "" and specific goals for interventions. In step two, using the principles of intervention mapping, we will develop a theory-based knowledge translation intervention that includes behavior modification techniques to overcome the identified barriers and improve enablers for DCD. In step three, we will roll out the intervention in hospitals across the 10 Canadian provinces and assess its effectiveness using a multiple-paused time-series design. Discussion We will use a behavioral approach to define and test novel, theory-based, and ethically acceptable knowledge translation strategies to increase the number of available DCD organ donors in Canada. If this study is successful, it will ultimately lead to more transplants and reduce patient morbidity and mortality at the population level.",0,0,
502,Design of a patient-centric personal health record to promote preventive care,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based prevention services offer profound health benefits, yet Americans receive only half of the care indicated. A variety of government and professional society policy initiatives encourage the adoption of information technologies to engage patients in their care, such as: B. personal health records, but current systems may not utilize the full potential of the technology. METHODS: Using a previously described model to make information technology more patient-centric, we developed an interactive preventive health record (IPHR) designed to engage patients more in preventive care and health promotion. We recruited 14 primary care practices to promote IPHR to all adult patients and sought practice and patient input in designing IPHR to ensure its usability, relevance, and generalizability. Input included patient usability tests, practice workflow observations, learning collaborations, and patient feedback. IPHR usage was measured using practice appointment and IPHR databases. RESULTS: The IPHR that emerged from this process creates tailored patient recommendations based on guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other organizations. It extracts clinical data from the electronic health record of the practices and receives information for the health risk assessment of patients. Clinical content is translated and explained in lay language. Recommendations examine the benefits and uncertainties of services and possible actions for patients and physicians. Embedded in the recommendations are self-management tools, risk calculators, decision aids and community resources selected according to the patient's clinical circumstances. Within six months, practices had encouraged 14.4% of patients to use IPHR (ranging from 1.5% to 28.3% across the 14 practices). Practices successfully integrated IPHR into their workflow and used it to prepare patients for visits, enhance behavioral counseling, explain test results, automatically remind patients of overdue services, notify physicians of needed services, and formulate personalized prevention plans. CONCLUSIONS: The IPHR demonstrates that a patient-centered personal health record connected to the electronic medical record can provide a high level of individualized guidance to patients and can be successfully adopted by busy primary care practices. Further investigation and refinement is needed to make information systems even more patient-centric and to demonstrate their impact on care.

503,"Designing a valid, randomized, pragmatic implementation study for primary care: the My Own Health Report (MOHR) project.","Background There is an urgent need for more attention to patient-centred health behaviors and psychosocial issues in primary care, and for practical tools, study designs, and outcomes of clinical and policy relevance. Our goal is to design a scientifically rigorous and validated pragmatic study to test whether primary care practices can implement patient information collection in a systematic way and provide patients with the counseling, goal setting, and counseling in response they need. Methods This manuscript reports the iterative design of the My Own Health Report (MOHR) study, a cluster-randomized delayed intervention study. Four months later, nine couples from different primary care practices are randomized to early or delayed intervention. The intervention consists of conducting the MOHR assessment, which addresses 10 domains of health behavior and psychosocial issues, and then providing the necessary counseling and support to patients presenting for wellness or chronic care. As a pragmatic participatory study, stakeholders, including practice partners and patients, were engaged throughout the study design to accommodate local resources and specifics. Participatory tasks include identifying MOHR assessment content, refining the study design, providing input on outcome measurements, and designing the implementation flow. Study outcomes include intervention reach (percentage of patients offered the MOHR assessment and who complete the MOHR assessment), efficacy (patients report being interviewed about issues, setting goals for change, and support for early versus delayed intervention practices). obtained), contextual factors influencing outcomes, and intervention costs. Discussion The MOHR study demonstrates how a participatory design can be used to promote the consistent collection and use of patient-reported health behavior and psychosocial assessments across a wide range of primary care settings. Although the study design is pragmatic in nature, it allows for valid comparisons to answer the research question posed, and the results are broadly generalisable to a range of primary care settings. According to the PRECIS framework (Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary), the study design is much more pragmatic than other published studies. The methods and results should be of interest to researchers, practitioners and policy makers trying to make healthcare more patient-centric and relevant.",0,1,
504,Recognition and management of alcohol consumption disorders in German primary care under the influence of non-clinical factors,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to determine the proportion of recognized and correctly referred patients in German primary care. The secondary objective was to identify patient and physician characteristics that predict detection and correct referral. Methods: In this clustered cross-sectional survey in German primary care, 3003 consecutive patients were invited to participate and asked to fill out a standardized health questionnaire. They were then screened for problem alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The physicians recorded their assessment of the presence of an alcohol use disorder and documented the course of treatment of all identified patients for 3 months. RESULTS: Correctly identified problem drinkers were 38.6% in a per-protocol analysis and 33.6% using a worst-case scenario. In 64.6% of the documented cases and in 27.0% in the worst-case scenario, the referral behavior of the physicians conformed to the guidelines. Several patient (e.g., gender, age) and provider (e.g., age) characteristics have been identified that influence patient diagnosis and referral. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need to improve the specific diagnostic and therapeutic skills of general practitioners so that they can indicate and implement secondary prevention. Further research should focus on the likely impact of implementing these diagnostic and management tools.",0,0,
505,Detection of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in relatives of patients with type I diabetes,"Lymphocytotoxic antibody levels were measured in serum samples from 19 patients recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and 43 healthy relatives (33 consanguineous and 10 non-consanguineous). The specificity of the reaction was tested at 15°C and 37°C against T lymphocytes and purified helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor subsets. Lymphocytotoxic antibody levels were significantly higher in each of the three test groups than in the control group (type I patients, p<0.005"", consanguineous relatives, p<0.001"", and non-consanguineous relatives, p<0.002). . The detection frequency of the antibodies was also higher in each of the study groups (p<0.01, p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Cytotoxicity affected both subgroups at 15°C but only cytotoxic/suppressor cells at 37°C. Findings of lymphocytotoxic antibodies in healthy relatives of type I diabetics, regardless of consanguinity, suggest that an environmental agent such as a virus is at least partially responsible for this lymphocytotoxic effect. Furthermore, the residual cytotoxic/suppressor cell killing at 37 degrees C may explain the suppressor cell defect seen in these patients.",0,0,
506,Determinants of health-promoting lifestyles of students,"This descriptive study of 151 college students in Boston, Massachusetts was conducted to determine the relationships of their perceived health status, gender, grade point average, and health and non-health majors to their health-promoting lifestyle using the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP) II , based on Pender's model. Students' perceived health status was significantly predictive of HPLP II overall, exercise, stress management, and spiritual growth. College women practiced significantly better nutrition, interpersonal relationships, health stewardship, and overall HPLP II than men. The entire sample performed worse on stress management than any previously studied group.

507,Determinants of successful clinical networks: the conceptual framework and study protocol,"Background Clinical networks are increasingly recognized as an important strategy to increase evidence-based practice and improve models of care, but success has varied and the characteristics of high-impact networks are uncertain. This study uses the variability in the functioning and outcomes of networks supported by Australia's New South Wales (NSW) Agency for Clinical Innovation non-mandatory model of clinical networks to examine the factors that contribute to the success of clinical networks. Methods/Design The aim of this retrospective study is to examine the relationship between external support, organizational and program-related factors and indicators of success in 19 clinical networks over a three-year period (2006-2008). The findings (health impact, system impact, programs implemented, engagement, user perceptions, and financial leverage) and explanatory factors are collected using a web-based survey, interviews, and recordings. An independent panel of experts will make judgments on the impact or scale of each network's health and systems impact initiatives. The expert panel ratings are the outcome used in multivariate analyses. Following the network success assessment, a qualitative study is conducted to examine the most successful networks in more detail. Discussion This is the first study to combine quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the factors that contribute to the success of clinical networks and is generally the largest study of clinical networks ever conducted. The adaptation of expert panel methods for evaluating the effects of networks is the methodical innovation of this study. The proposed project will identify the conditions that should be created or encouraged by agencies developing clinical networks and will be of direct use in developing strategies and programs to maximize the effectiveness of such networks.",0,0,
508,Development of a managed clinical network in palliative care: a realistic assessment,"BACKGROUND: Achieving evidence-based practice is at the forefront of the international practice development agenda. It is therefore imperative that robust assessment methods are available to test new approaches to service development. OBJECTIVES: This paper reflects the merits and challenges of a realistic assessment design in establishing a new Managed Clinical Network (MCN) approach to implementation of guideline addressing the care of individuals with cancer-related pain. DESIGN AND METHODS: There were three assessment items examining three versions of the MCN nursing approach. At each stage, steps were taken to identify the context, mechanisms, and outcomes associated with the version of the model being studied. Findings from patient-centred case studies were incorporated into realistic evaluation discussions with the management group. SETTING: A rural basic service in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Three elderly men, their families, and the doctors and nurses directly attending to them participated along with 13 members of the network management group. RESULTS: The research clarified the effort required by practitioners to implement the MCN nursing approach. Progress has been much slower than expected, frustrated at times by inexperience in change management and unfamiliarity with leading practice development projects and supporting practitioner learning. Issues related to the age adequacy of the evidence base related to caring for the frail elderly were also evident. The occupational group that experienced the most role changes were district nurses and community pharmacists. CONCLUSION: The collaborative approach encouraged by the realistic assessment framework was found to be particularly helpful, and there was consensus that assessment had become an integral part of the intervention itself. There were a number of methodological challenges and the need to limit the depth of ""realistic unraveling"". However, as a formative approach, realistic evaluation proved to be a worthy design in the chaotic world of interdisciplinary practice development.",0,0,
509,Development of a pain assessment tool for use by nurses in an adult intensive care unit,"Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to pain, which patients cite as the second most stressful factor in the ICU. Pain has also been identified as an aggravating factor in critical illness. Despite this, pain management is often not considered a priority by the ICU team. Effective treatment can only be achieved with an accurate pain assessment. However, this is difficult in the case of the seriously ill, since the patients are often unable to communicate verbally due to the presence of endotracheal/tracheal cannulas, sedatives and paralytics. Caregivers therefore rely on behavioral and physiological indicators to determine the presence of pain. However, since these also occur in situations and conditions that are not associated with pain, a systematic, objective assessment tool is required. Such a tool, consisting of a numerical and verbal rating scale to facilitate documentation and verification, was developed as a result of ongoing adaptation and evaluation. The tool assesses the patient's pain by incorporating behavioral and physiological indicators and is used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Score and the Modified Sheffield Sedation Scale to achieve a comprehensive neurological assessment. Because movement and intervention can exacerbate pain, assessment is done at rest and during procedures such as suctioning and manual handling. A flowchart and clinical guideline were also introduced to aid in pain assessment and management. Although a preliminary evaluation confirmed the instrument's effectiveness as a means of estimating and recording pain levels in individual patients, it was evident that the way pain is managed has not changed. To address this issue, nurses' knowledge of pain management was assessed and training was conducted to raise the profile of pain management in the department.",0,0,
510,Developing a Science of Clinical Utility in Field Study Strategies for Diagnostic Classification Systems for ICD-11 Mental and Behavioral Disorders,"The World Health Organization (WHO) Division of Mental Health and Substance Abuse has developed a systematic program of field studies to assess and improve the clinical usefulness of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for mental and behavioral disorders in the eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -11). The clinical usefulness of a diagnostic classification is critical to its function as an interface between health contacts and health information, and to making the ICD-11 a more effective tool to help the 194 member countries of the WHO, including the United States, manage the global burden of mental illness disturbances. This article describes the WHO's efforts to develop a science of clinical utility related to one of the two main classification systems for mental disorders. We present the rationale and methods for an integrated and complementary set of field study strategies, including large international surveys, formative field studies on the structure of clinicians' conceptualization of mental disorders, case-controlled field studies using experimental methods to assess the proposed impact of changes in diagnostic guidelines on diagnostic decision-making Physicians and environmental implementation Field studies with clinical utility in the global settings where the guidelines will ultimately be implemented. The results of these studies have already informed decisions about the structure and content of ICD-11. If clinical usefulness is indeed among the highest goals of mental disorder diagnostic systems, as their developers routinely claim, future revision efforts should continue to build on these efforts.

511,Development of an intervention to encourage young people's participation in asthma screening consultations with practicing nurses,"AIM: The article is a report of a study to develop an evidence-based pre-counseling guide for young people to be used prior to a nurse's asthma assessment. BACKGROUND: Participation of young people aged 13-19 in consultations with health professionals may be limited by the lack of opportunities to learn the relevant skills in triadic consultations. Evidence-based interventions to encourage adult participation in consultation have been developed, but the needs of young people have not been specifically addressed. DESIGN: Design using multiple methods informed by guidelines for designing complex interventions. METHODS: In 2007, a pre-counselling guide for young people was developed through application of a health behavior change model, development of criteria by an expert panel and in consultation with young people using a nominal group technique. RESULTS: The concepts of the Health Action Process Approach model were applied to the development of criteria underpinning the pre-consultation guide. In the nominal groups, the young people agreed that they have different needs than other children and adults. The consensus was that the pre-counseling guide should include disease-specific information, realistic photographs rather than clipart, consistent fonts, bullets and colors, short words, and mature language. Statements and sample questions written by young people have been included in the evidence-based guide. CONCLUSION: Young people's views can inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting communication in consultations with caregivers. There is potential for this approach to be used to develop interventions in primary and secondary care for a range of long-term conditions.",0,0,

Community pediatricians and nurses recorded all contacts with children with emotional and behavioral difficulties (EBD) over a one-month period. Data on encountered difficulties and intervention pathways were collected. The same children were reassessed five months later and outcome was measured by clinical assessment and support provided. The work showed that child health workers handled cases both through individual counseling sessions and through planned ongoing support.

The goals of Healthy People 2000 aim to reduce tobacco use among high-risk groups such as adolescents and pregnant women. This article describes smoking cessation guidelines for healthcare professionals working with pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers who smoke."";"" PIP: This article examines key components of smoking cessation and health promotion interventions for pregnant and parenting adolescents. It also describes smoking cessation guidelines for healthcare professionals when working with pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers who smoke. Both pregnancy and tobacco use are increasing among youth in the United States. There is strong evidence that cigarette smoking among pregnant adolescents is even higher than the national rate. Such a habit in pregnant teenagers poses an immediate risk to the fetus, plus an increased risk of the teenager developing a smoking habit. Quitting smoking during pregnancy can have a significant impact on reducing infant mortality. To this end, it is suggested that health professionals can have a positive impact on maternal, infant and child health by encouraging and supporting smoking cessation efforts among young mothers. The physician is in a special position to offer this advice during health surveillance visits. Overall, the intervention guidelines presented in this article can be used in school clinics with pregnant schoolgirls and can easily be implemented in private practices or clinics.",0,0,
514,Developing internet-based health interventions: a guide for public health researchers and practitioners,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners interested in developing online health interventions rely mostly on web-based and printed resources to guide them through the process of developing online interventions. While it is useful to understand many aspects of best practice for website development, these resources lack concrete examples of online health app development experiences from the perspective of those delivering online health interventions. AIM: This study is intended to serve as a series of case studies on the development of online health interventions to provide insights for researchers and practitioners considering technology-based interventional or programmatic approaches. METHODS: A sample of six study coordinators and five principal investigators at a large US-based land grant university were interviewed about the process of developing online interventions in the areas of alcohol policy, youth health, medication use, and human immunodeficiency virus prevention in transgender individuals and in men who have sex with men. Participants were asked questions that addressed each of the four phases of the User-Centered Design Process Map from the US Department of Health and Human Services Research-Based Web Design & Usability Guidelines. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. Qualitative codes were developed using line-by-line open coding for all transcripts, and all transcripts were independently coded by at least 2 authors. Disagreements between the programmers were resolved through discussions. FINDINGS: We identified the following seven themes: (1) hire a strong (or at least the right) research team, (2) take time to plan before beginning the design process, (3) acknowledge that vendors and researchers have different values, goals, and language, (4) develop a detailed contract, (5) document all decisions and development activities, (6) use a content management system, and (7) plan additional ones Time to test and debug your intervention. Each of these areas is discussed in detail, with supporting citations from principal investigators and study coordinators. CONCLUSIONS: The values of the members of each participating organization involved in the development of the online intervention or program and the goals to be achieved with the website must be considered. These defined values and goals should stimulate an open and explicit discussion about the scope of work, budget and other needs from each organization's perspective. Because of the complexity of developing online interventions, researchers and practitioners should become familiar with the process and how it may differ from the development and implementation of in-person interventions or programs. To support this, the intervention team should consider augmenting the team with experts in computer science or learning technologies and utilizing institutional resources needed to successfully complete the project. Finally, we describe the trade-off between available resources for online intervention or program development and the complexity of the project.",0,0,
515,Developing leadership capacity for guideline use: a randomized controlled trial with pilot clusters,"MEANING: The importance of leadership in influencing the use of clinical guidelines by nurses is well documented. However, little is known about how leadership interventions can be developed and evaluated for use in guidelines. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test a leadership intervention aimed at influencing nurses' application of guideline recommendations when caring for patients with diabetic foot ulcers in the home setting. This paper reports on the feasibility of implementing the study protocol, the study results in terms of nursing process outcomes and leadership behavior. METHODS: A mixed-methods pilot study was conducted using a post-only randomized controlled cluster study and descriptive qualitative interviews. Four units were randomized to control or experimental groups. Clinical and management leadership teams participated in a 12-week leadership intervention (workshop, conference calls). Participants received summarized chart audit data, identified change targets, and created a team leadership action. Criteria for evaluating the feasibility of the protocol included: design, intervention, measures, and data collection procedures. For the study, chart audits compared differences in nursing process outcomes. PRIMARY RESULT: 8-Point Nursing Evaluation Score. Secondary outcome: 5-point score of care based on change goals identified by intervention participants. Qualitative interviews described leadership behavior that influenced the use of guidelines. RESULTS: Conducting this pilot project showed that some aspects of the study protocol were feasible while others needed further development. The study results showed no significant difference in the primary endpoint. A significant increase was observed in the 5-point score chosen by intervention participants (p=0.02). In the experimental group, relationship-oriented leadership behavior, audit and feedback, and reminders were described as leadership strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a leadership intervention has the potential to influence nurses' use of guideline recommendations, but more work is needed to refine the intervention and outcome measures. A taxonomy of leadership behavior is proposed to inform future research.",0,0,
516,Development of quality benchmarks for the management of suicidal behaviors in the emergency department,"OBJECTIVE: Given the public health importance of suicidal behaviors and the corresponding gap in the performance measurement literature, we attempted to identify key process indicators (measures of quality of care) and structural measures (organizational resources and characteristics) that are relevant to the Emergency Department (ED) Management of Suicidal Behaviors in Children. METHODS: We reviewed nationally accepted guidelines and published research to compile an inventory of interventions. Next, we surveyed experienced pediatric ED clinicians to assess the level of agreement on the relevance (to patient care) and variability (across hospitals) of 42 candidate process indicators and to assess whether 10 hospital and regional structural measures could affect these processes . RESULTS: Twenty-three physicians from 14 pediatric tertiary care hospitals responded (93% of hospitals contacted). Possible process indicators identified as both most relevant to patient care (>/= 87% agreed or strongly agreed) and most varied across hospitals (>/= 78% agreed or strongly agreed) were waiting time for a medical evaluation”, referral to a crisis intervention staff/program; Mental health assessment, psychosocial or risk assessment required; any inpatient admission; inpatient psychiatric admission; treatment plan after discharge; waiting time for the first follow-up appointment; follow-up care received; and type of follow-up received. Key hospital and regional structural measures (>/=87% agreed or strongly agreed) were professionals and type of professionals in or available for the ED; regional policies, protocols or procedures;” and inpatient mental health services. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted candidate performance measures for ED management of suicidal behaviors in children. The 9 candidate process indicators (covering screening, assessment, admission, discharge and follow-up) and 4 hospital and regional structural measures deserve further development.",0,0,
517,Developing team leadership to facilitate guideline application: planning and evaluating a 3-month intervention strategy,"BACKGROUND: Research describes leadership as important to the use of guidelines. However, interventions to develop current and future leaders to this end are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the planning and evaluation of a leadership intervention to help caregivers apply guideline recommendations for diabetic foot ulcers in the home setting. METHOD: The planning of the intervention involved a synthesis of theory and research (qualitative interviews and chart audits). A workshop and three subsequent conference calls were held at two locations for nurse managers and clinical directors (n=15) responsible for 180 employed nurses. The evaluation included workshop surveys and interviews. RESULTS: The highest-scoring intervention components (four-point scale) were: identification of goal indicators (mean 3.7) and development of an action plan for team leadership (mean 3.5). The rating of the barriers before the workshop was rated the lowest (mean 2.9). Three months later, participants indicated that their leadership performance had changed as a result of the intervention, that they were more engaged with the employees and that they were clear about the implementation goals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Creating a team leadership action plan to operationalize leadership behaviors can aid in the delivery of evidence-based nursing. Access to clinical data and understanding of team leadership knowledge and skills prior to formal training assists nursing management in adapting intervention strategies to identify needs and gaps.",0,0,
518,"Development of the protocol for the evaluation of the Health Foundation's ""Engagement with Quality Initiative"" - an emerging approach","In 2004, UK charity The Health Foundation launched the Engaging with Quality Initiative to research and assess the benefits of engaging clinicians in quality improvement in healthcare. Eight projects from professional associations or specialist societies were commissioned in various areas of acute care. A development approach was chosen for the initiative, which was accompanied by a two-stage evaluation: eight self-assessments of the projects and an associated external evaluation. This paper describes how the protocol for external evaluation was developed. Challenges included major differences between and within projects (in approach, scope and context, and understanding of quality improvement), the need to support project teams in their self-assessments while maintaining the necessary objectivity, and the difficulty of assessing the mobile Goal created by the development approach adopted in the initiative. An initial phase in developing the assessment protocol proved invaluable in helping us investigate these issues.",0,0,
519,Development and implementation of a tool for quality improvement in medical oncology for a regional oncology network: the Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners initiative,"Fox Chase Cancer Center Partners (FCCCP) is a community hospital/academic partnership comprised of 25 hospitals in the Delaware Valley. Originally founded in 1986, FCCCP advances quality cancer care in the community through education, quality assurance and access to clinical trials research. An important aspect of quality assurance is an annual medical oncology audit that compares quality indicators and guidelines and provides a roadmap for quality improvement initiatives in community oncology clinical practice. Each year, the FCCCP team and partner Medical Oncologists create disease site and stage specific indicators based on the clinical practice guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in oncology. Compliance with multiple indicators is assessed using 20 charts from each group practice. A report for each FCCCP medical oncology practice summarizes documentation, screening recommendations, use of new drugs, and research trends at a specific disease site. Descriptive statistics reflect the indicators achieved, the number of new cases per year, the number of cases at the site of disease from tumor registry information, and the total number of clinical trial results collected. Training and documentation tools are made available to oncology practice physicians and nurses. The FCCCP Clinical Operations Team, consisting of medical oncologists and oncology-certified nurses, has been conducting quality audits in medical oncology practices using NCCN-derived indicators for 7 years. Successful audits on gastric, colon and breast cancer have been the focus of recent assessments. In the 2005 assessment of stage II/III breast cancer, the average compliance per parameter was 88%, with 15 out of 16 practices achieving an average compliance greater than 80%. A large-scale quality assurance audit in a community cancer partner network is feasible. Recent assessment of localized breast cancer shows high compliance with guidelines and identifies areas for targeted education. The partnership between academic and local oncologists results in a quality review process that is broadly applicable and adaptable to changing medical knowledge.",0,0,
520,Development and implementation of a program to assess medical patients' need for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Purpose. The development and implementation of a program to assess the need of medical patients for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE) is described. Summary. Hartford Hospital's pharmacy, medical and information services departments have worked together to create a program to improve VTE prevention in medical patients. After assessing adherence to baseline VTE prophylaxis, departments designed an intervention consisting of a message to be displayed to providers using the institution's computerized order entry system (CPOE) as a reminder to Assess the current patient for VTE risk factors and the need for VTE prophylaxis. The message was displayed when a patient met predefined criteria for VTE risk factors. The message was no longer displayed once either mechanical or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis was an active prescription in the patient's medication profile. Hospital staff, pharmacists, doctors, nurses and nurses received extensive training on the program. The program was implemented in March 2007 on a medical pilot floor. To measure the impact of the program, a retrospective review of the charts was performed using the developed risk assessment tool. The VTE prophylaxis compliance rate after implementation was 93% compared to 49% before program implementation (p<0.001). Before the program, only 25% of patients with a contraindication to pharmacological therapy received mechanical prophylaxis compared to 100% after program implementation. Conclusion. The use of alerts through a CPOE system and an interdisciplinary team approach to assess patients' VTE risk appeared to improve the use of VTE prophylaxis in medical patients.",0,1,
521,Development and implementation of non-pharmacological protocols for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families in a multiracial primary care setting,"PURPOSE: Most patients and families with dementia are cared for in primary care hospitals. These clinics are rarely designed to provide the necessary comprehensive care. The purpose of this article is to describe non-pharmacological protocols for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease and their families, administered as part of a multifaceted care management intervention program in a multiracial primary care clinic. DESIGN & METHODS: The non-pharmacological component for the integrated cooperative care program was developed based on a literature review and previous clinical experience. Care is coordinated by a geriatric nurse who meets with patients, families and GPs. The non-pharmacological protocols included general educational guidelines about Alzheimer's disease. Specific protocols have also been developed to treat the common behavioral disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease. A key component of the intervention is a monthly psychoeducational support group for family caregivers. RESULTS: The intervention was well received by patients, families, and physicians. Approximately half of the treatment group participated regularly in the self-help group. IMPACT: The integration of behavioral interventions and team nurturing within primary care has been successful.",0,0,

523,Developing a behavior change intervention: A case study of the practical application of the theory,"BACKGROUND: The use of theory in the implementation of complex interventions is widely recommended. In the Managing Osteoarthritis in Consultations (MOSAICS) study, a complex study intervention to improve self-management support for people with osteoarthritis (OA) needed to be implemented in primary care. One component of the study intervention was conducting an extended consultation for patients with osteoarthritis by general practitioners (GPs). The aim of our case study is to describe the systematic selection and use of theory to design a behavior change intervention to implement the GP delivery of extended consultation. METHODS: The development of the behavior change intervention was guided by four theoretical models/frameworks: i) an implementation of the change model to guide the overall approach, ii) the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify relevant determinants of change, iii) a model for the selection of Behavior change techniques to address identified determinants of behavior change, and iv) the principles of adult learning. Methods and measures to assess the effect of the behavior change intervention were identified. RESULTS: The behavior change intervention presented GPs with a well-defined proposal for change” addressed seven of the TDF domains (e.g., knowledge, skills, motivation, and goals); included ten behavior change techniques (eg, providing information, practicing skills). , persuasive communication);"" and was delivered in workshops that valued the expertise and professional values of GPs. The workshops used a mix of interactive and didactic sessions, were moderated by opinion leaders, and utilized ""contextual communication skills training"". Among the methods selected and measures to assess the behavior change intervention included: assessment of satisfaction with the workshops, physician's report of intent to practice, and an assessment of videotaped consultations by primary care physicians with patients with OA.CONCLUSIONS: A stepwise approach to developing an intervention for Behavior change, with the use of theoretical frameworks to identify determinants of change, aligned with behavior change techniques, has enabled a systematic and theory-driven development of an intervention aimed at GP consultations improve patients with OA. The success of the practice behavior change intervention will be assessed in the context of the MOSAICS study as a whole and will inform the understanding of practice levels and patient outcomes in the study.",0,0,
524,Development of a complex intervention for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease in primary care using the UK Medical Research Council framework,"AIM: To apply the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the design and assessment of complex intervention studies to a primary health care intervention to promote secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. STUDY DESIGN: Case report of intervention development. METHODS: First, the literature on secondary prevention and lifestyle modification was reviewed. Second, a preliminary intervention was modeled based on literature reviews and focus group interviews with patients (n = 23) and staff (n = 29) from 4 general practices. Participants' experiences and attitudes towards the main components of the intervention were examined. Third, the preliminary intervention was piloted in 4 primary care practices. After conducting the pilot intervention, practitioners evaluated the training sessions and qualitative data on the experience of the intervention was collected using semi-structured interviews with staff (n=10) and patient focus groups (n=17). RESULTS: The literature review identified 3 intervention components: a structured callback system, physician education, and patient information. Initial qualitative data identified variations in recall system design, training requirements (drug prescribing, enabling behavior changes), and information appropriate to potential study participants. The identification of detailed structures within the intervention components clarified how the intervention can be tailored to the individual needs of the practice, physician and patient, while preserving the theoretical functions of the components. Findings from the pilot phase informed how to further model the intervention, reduce administrative time, increase the practical content of the training, and omit unhelpful patient information. CONCLUSION: Application of the MRC framework helped determine the feasibility and development of a complex intervention for primary care research.",0,0,
525,Development of a complex intervention to promote appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in Irish primary care practice,"Background Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be viewed as failure to meet recommended goals for management of important risk factors, including glycemic control, blood pressure, and lipids. Insufficient control of risk factors is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Failure to escalate medication when indicated in patients with poor control of T2DM is termed clinical inertia and is a contributing factor to poor control of T2DM. Our aim was to develop a theory- and evidence-based complex intervention to improve appropriate prescribing and medication intensification for poorly controlled T2DM in Irish general practice. Methods The first level of the Medical Research Council Framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions was used. To identify current evidence, we conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions targeting patients with poorly controlled T2DM in community settings. The theoretical approach of the behavior change wheel was used to identify suitable intervention functions. Workshops, simulation, collaborations with academic partners, and physician observation were used to operationalize the intervention functions and to design the elements of the complex intervention. Results Our systematic review showed that professional interventions, possibly through clinical decision support systems, could counteract poorly controlled T2DM. Appropriate intensification of antiglycemic and cardiovascular medication by general practitioners (GPs) for adults with poorly controlled T2DM has been identified as a key behavior to manage clinical inertia. Psychological skills were the primary driver for the behavior that needed to be changed, which suggested five key intervention functions (education, training, empowerment, environmental restructuring, and incentives) and nine key behavior change techniques operationalized in a complex intervention. The intervention consists of three components: (a) an educational program/academic detailing of target GPs, (b) a remote finder tool to help GPs identify patients with poor control of T2DM in their practice, and (c) a web-based clinical decision support system. Conclusions This paper describes a multifaceted process, including an examination of current evidence and a thorough theoretical understanding of the predictors of behavior, leading to the design of a complex intervention to promote the implementation of evidence-based guidelines through appropriate prescribing and medication intensification in poorly controlled T2DM.",0,1,
526,Development of a minimization tool for assigning a hospital-level performance improvement intervention to reduce emergency department wait times in Ontario,"Background A rigorous assessment of an intervention requires that its allocation be impartial to confounders; this is particularly difficult in complex, system-wide care interventions. We developed a brief survey instrument to identify factors for a minimization algorithm for a hospital referral-level intervention to reduce emergency department (ED) wait times in Ontario, Canada. Methods Potential confounders affecting intervention success were identified by Literature review identified and grouped by specific stages of change in health attitudes An international multidisciplinary (clinical, administrative, decision-making). Maker, Management) panel assessed these factors in a two-stage modified Delphi and nominal group process based on four domains: willingness to change, evidence base, spurious validity, and clarity of definition. The panel reduced the list to 12 in the first round of surveys. In the second survey experts rated each factor according to the four domains; Summary assessments and consensus discussion led to the final selection and measurement of four hospital-level factors to be used in the minimization algorithm: improved patient flow as a hospital's guiding priority; openness of doctors to organizational changes; bed management efficiency;"" and physician incentives that support the change goal. Conclusion We developed a simple tool designed to collect data from senior hospital administrators on factors likely to influence the success of an intervention to improve hospital patient flow A minimization algorithm ensures a balanced allocation of intervention with respect to these factors in study clinics.",0,1,
527,Development of an instrument to measure clinical competence in occupational therapy: a pilot study?,"Clinical competency is generally defined as a combination of knowledge, ability and professional conduct. It is typically assessed using written tests, direct observation, chart audit, customer satisfaction surveys, and supervisor ratings. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a chart-stimulated recall (CSR) measurement that combines the methods of the chart audit and the clinician interview to assess the clinical competence of practicing occupational therapists. Developed using Canadian guidelines for client-centred practice, the CSR tool opens up global skill areas: use of theory, assessment, program planning, intervention, discharge planning, follow-up, program evaluation, clinical reasoning, and professional conduct. This pilot study involved two independent raters/interviewers who evaluated twelve occupational therapists on two occasions, each using a random sample of patient cases/records. The results show that the CSR tool is not only reliable and valid, but also sufficiently general to be used in a variety of real-world settings as a global measure of workplace performance.",0,0,
528,"Developing an exercise program for older adults: pre-exercise testing, exercise prescription, and program maintenance","Health professionals have the technical skills, frequency of contact and credibility with older adults to use physical activity as a health promotion and disease prevention intervention.

529,Development of an ICF-based clinical practice guideline for functional assessment in head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: The functional outcome after head and neck cancer is not regularly standardized in clinical practice. Clinical trials to assess functional outcome use many different tools. Therefore, the results are not always comparable and have limited clinical implications. The aim of this study was the identification, interdisciplinary evaluation and recommendation of functional outcome instruments for use in clinical practice and in clinical trials in patients with HNC. MATERIAL: Preliminary studies resulted in a shortlist of outcome instruments based on previously defined criteria. An interdisciplinary group of experts evaluated these instruments and decided which ones can be recommended for use in 3 application areas: screening, therapy evaluation/planning and clinical studies. Health care decision-makers included physicians (ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, radiation therapists, oncologists), medical psychologists, speech and language therapists, physical therapists, and social workers. RESULTS: 98 instruments were presented at the consensus conference. A total of 21 participants recommended a basic set of measures for assessing impairments in 6 functional areas for each of the 3 application areas: therapy follow-up, pain, nutritional intake, voice/speech, other organic problems and psychosocial problems. CONCLUSION: A multiprofessional pool of experts discussed and approved recommendations for the use of functional outcome instruments in clinical practice and/or research. The recommended instruments are now available for use in clinical routine.",0,0,
530,Developing clinical practice guidelines for the care of people undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions: A collaboration between Australia and New Zealand,"AIM: This paper describes the development of nursing guidelines for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to support PCI nursing care are limited. METHOD: The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) Guidelines for the Development of Health and Medical Practices were used for the guideline development process. A panel of experts (clinicians and consumers) attended a consensus conference to review existing evidence. The nurses' opinions were then collected via an online survey. A draft guideline was then refined in two rounds using a modified Delphi method. RESULTS: The consensus conference was attended by 41 participants (39 cardiovascular nurses and 2 consumer representatives). Eight other members joined the panel for the modified Delphi rounds, with 27 participants completing the online survey. The final guidance document consisted of 75 recommendations. Approval was then obtained from key cardiovascular bodies in Australia and New Zealand. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Inconclusive evidence precludes definitive recommendations. Therefore, consultation and consensus are important in developing guidelines to achieve standardized maintenance and monitoring of outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses play a critical role in PCI care, yet there are currently limited guidelines to inform practice. This paper describes the methodology for developing clinical practice guidelines and deriving consensus.",0,0,
531,Development of geriatric skills for resident emergency physicians as part of an expert consensus process,"BACKGROUND: The emergency department (ED) visit rate for elderly patients exceeds that of all age groups except infants. The aging population will increase utilization of older ED patients to 35% to 60% of all visits. Elderly patients can have complex clinical presentations and be resource intensive. There is evidence that emergency physicians do not consistently provide high quality care to older ED patients, leading to poor clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was the development of a consensus document on “Geriatric Competences for Emergency Medical Practitioners” by recognized experts. This is a minimum set of behavior-based performance standards that all residents should be able to demonstrate by completing their residency training. METHODS: This consensus-based process used an inductive, qualitative, multi-phased method to determine the minimum geriatric competencies needed by emergency medical professionals (EM). Face validity and reliability ratings were used throughout the project. RESULTS: In Phase I, participants (n=363) identified 12 domains and 300 potential competencies. In Phase II, a panel of experts (n=24) grouped the responses from Phase I, resulting in eight domains and 72 competencies. In phase III, the expert panel reduced the competencies to 26. In phase IV, the analysis of the spurious validity and reliability showed a 100% consensus for eight domains and 26 competencies. The domains identified were ""atypical disease manifestations,"" trauma including falls, cognitive and behavioral disorders, intervention modification interventions, medication management, care transitions, pain management, and palliative care."" and effect of comorbidities.

532,"Development, implementation and evaluation of a community pharmacy-based asthma care model","BACKGROUND Pharmacists are uniquely positioned in the healthcare system to address critical issues in the management of asthma in the community. Various programs have demonstrated the benefits of a pharmacist-led asthma care programme, however no such programs have been evaluated in Australia to date. OBJECTIVE To measure the impact of a specialized asthma service provided by community pharmacies in terms of patient objective clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. METHODS A parallel controlled design was used, recruiting 52 intervention patients and 50 control patients with asthma at two different sites .In the intervention area, pharmacists were trained and delivered a 3-visit asthma care model over 6 months. This model was compared between and within groups based on clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in asthma severity in the intervention group, 2.6 ± 0.5 to 1.6 ± 0.7 (mean ± SD; p < 0.001) versus the control group, 2.3 ± 0.7 to 1.6 ± 0.7 2.4±0.5. In the intervention group, peak flow indices improved from 82.7% ± 8.2% at baseline to 87.4% ± 8.9% (p<0.001) at the last visit, and there was a significant reduction in defined Daily dose of albuterol used by patients increased from 374.8 ± 314.8 µg at baseline to 198.4 ± 196.9 µg at last visit (p<0.015). There was also a statistically significant improvement in perceived asthma control and asthma-related knowledge scores in the intervention group compared to the control group between baseline and last visit. Annual savings of $132.84 (AU) in medication costs per patient and $100,801.20 for the entire group based on overall severity reduction have been demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results of this study, it appears that a specialized treatment model for asthma offers community pharmacists the opportunity to contribute to improving asthma management in the Australian community.",0,1,
533,Diabetes in Rural Cities: Effectiveness of Education and Feedback for Healthcare Providers in Changing Population-Level Diabetes Outcomes: Protocol for a Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases internationally. The health complications associated with type 2 diabetes can be prevented, delayed, or ameliorated with early diagnosis and effective management. This research aims to examine the impact of a primarily web-based educational intervention on diabetes care by general practitioners (GPs) in rural areas and resulting patient outcomes. A population-based approach to outcome assessment is used, via city-wide anonymized pathological records. METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a cluster-randomized controlled trial with rural communities as the unit of analysis. Cities from four Australian states were selected and matched based on factors such as rurality, population size, proportion of Indigenous Australians in the population, and socioeconomic status. Eleven city pairs from two states were eligible for the trial, and one city from each pair was randomly assigned to the experimental group. GPs in cities assigned to the experimental group will be offered an intervention package that includes training on diabetes care best practices via an active online learning module, a moderated discussion forum, access to targeted and expert advice via an online inquiry form, and city-based performance feedback on diabetes monitoring and outcomes. The package is offered via repeated direct mail. DISCUSSION: The benefits of the study's findings are described along with the challenges and limitations associated with the methodology.

535,Diabetes Nurse Case Management and Motivational Interviewing for Change (DYNAMIC): Study Design and Baseline Features in the Chronic Care Model for Type 2 Diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that diabetes is costly and devastating, the healthcare system is ill-equipped to meet the challenges of managing chronic diseases. The Penn State Institute of Diabetes & Obesity is evaluating a model of treating type 2 diabetes that incorporates nursing case management (NCM) and motivational interviewing (MI) to encourage behavior change. The primary care intervention is designed to improve patient self-care and reduce clinical inertia by having the provider use standardized clinical guidelines to achieve better diabetes outcomes. METHODS: This RCT tests the effectiveness of improved NCM intervention on outcomes in type 2 DM (n=549) patients mediated by changes in self-care behaviors and diabetes management. Outcome measures include: (a) effect on clinical parameters such as HbA1c (<7), BP (<130/80) and LDL (<100), depression scores and weight""; (b) process measures such as complication screening; (c) psychological and patient behavioral outcomes as measured by emotional distress (PAID), diabetes-specific quality of life (ADDQoL), patient satisfaction (DTSQ), self-care activities (SDSCA) and (d) physician satisfaction and cost-effectiveness of the intervention CONCLUSIONS: Baseline includes (average) Age = 58; BMI = 34.4; 57% female;"" 47% Caucasian and 39% Hispanic. Patients had elevated HbA1c (8.4), BP (137/77), and LDL (114). Overall, the patients were depressed (CES-D=21.6) and had an extremely negative quality of life (ADDQoL=-1.58). We believe that improved NCM will both improve self-care and reduce emotional distress in patients with diabetes.

We review advances in diabetes translation research and identify future challenges and opportunities in this area. Several promising interventions to optimize the delivery of effective diabetes treatments are available. Many of these interventions, individually or in combination, need to be more formally tested in larger randomized or quasi-experimental field trials, using outcomes of particular interest to patients (e.g. patient satisfaction and quality of life) and policy makers (e.g. costs). become and profitability). The long-term outcomes (such as morbidity, mortality, quality of life, and costs) of strategies to improve diabetes care need to be evaluated.

537,Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this NIH Consensus Statement is to inform the biomedical research and clinical practice communities of the findings of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The statement provides up-to-date information on effective treatments for ADHD and presents the consensus panel's conclusions and recommendations on these issues. In addition, the statement identifies those areas of study that require further investigation. Upon completion of this educational activity, the reader should have clear practical clinical knowledge of the state of the art on the subject. The target group of clinicians for this statement includes psychiatrists, general practitioners, paediatricians, internists, neurologists, psychologists and behavioral medicine specialists. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were a panel of 13 representing the fields of psychology, psychiatry, neurology, pediatrics, epidemiology, biostatistics, education and the public. In addition, 31 experts in the same fields presented data to the panel and a conference audience of 1,215. EVIDENCE: The literature was searched via Medline and an extensive bibliography of references was made available to the panel and conference audience. Experts created abstracts with relevant citations from the literature. Scientific evidence was given priority over clinical anecdotal experience. CONSENSUS PROCESS: The panel answered predefined questions and developed its conclusions based on the scientific evidence and literature presented in the open forum. The panel produced a draft statement, which was read in its entirety and circulated to the experts and audience for comment. The panel then resolved conflicting recommendations and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The panel completed the revisions within weeks of the conference. The draft statement was made available on the World Wide Web immediately after its publication at the conference and was updated with the final revisions of the panel. CONCLUSIONS: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is a commonly diagnosed childhood behavioral disorder that poses a costly major public health problem. Children with ADHD have distinct disabilities and can experience long-term adverse effects on academic achievement, career success, and socio-emotional development that have profound effects on the individual, family, school, and society. Despite advances in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD, the disorder and its treatment have remained controversial, particularly the use of psychostimulants for both short- and long-term treatment. Although there is no independent diagnostic test for ADHD, there is evidence to support the validity of the disorder. Further research is needed on the dimensional aspects of ADHD, as well as the comorbid (coexisting) conditions present in both the childhood and adult forms. Studies (mostly short-term, approximately three months), including randomized clinical trials, have demonstrated the effectiveness of stimulants and psychosocial treatments in relieving the symptoms of ADHD and associated aggressiveness, and have shown that stimulants are more effective than psychosocial therapies in managing these symptoms . Due to the lack of consistent improvement beyond core symptoms and the lack of long-term studies (beyond 14 months), there is a need for longer-term studies of drugs and behavioral modalities and their combination. Although studies are ongoing, no definitive recommendations for long-term treatment can be made at this time. There is wide variation in the use of psychostimulants between communities and physicians, suggesting that there is no consensus on which ADHD patients should be treated with psychostimulants.

539,Diagnostic evaluation of low back pain with an emphasis on imaging,"Purpose: To review the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical information and imaging for patients with back pain in primary care. Data source: MEDLINE search (January 1966 to September 2001) for articles and reviews relevant to the accuracy of the clinical and radiological data Study of patients with low back pain. Study selection: The authors screened abstracts and selected articles for review based on a combined assessment. Clinical examination data were mainly based on recent systematic reviews, while imaging data were mainly based on original papers. Data extraction: The diagnostic results were extracted by one or the other author. The quality of the methods was identified informally assessed, but no quantitative data extraction nor scoring was performed, highest for magnetic resonance imaging (0.83 to 0.93) and radionuclide scanning (0.74 to 0.98);” the specificity was highest for magnetic resonance imaging (0.9 to 0.97) and radiography (0.95 to 0.99). Magnetic resonance imaging was the most sensitive (0.96) and specific (0.92) test for infection. The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging for herniated discs were slightly higher than those of computed tomography, but very similar for the diagnosis of spinal canal stenosis. Conclusions: The data suggest a diagnostic strategy similar to the 1994 guidelines of the Health Policy and Research Agency. In adults younger than 50 years of age without signs or symptoms of systemic disease, symptomatic therapy without imaging is appropriate. In patients 50 years and older or with findings suggestive of systemic disease, plain radiographs and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic disease. Extended imaging should be reserved for patients considering surgery or suspected systemic disease.",0,0,
540,Dietary Management of Hypercholesterolemia: Do Dietitians Do It Any Better? A randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Current National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines recommend initial dietary counseling by physicians for most patients with hypercholesterolemia. Referral to a licensed dietician and lipid-lowering medications are recommended only for patients who remain hypercholesterolemic. We evaluated the added value of detailed nutritional advice from dietitians when added to general nutritional advice from physicians. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with hypercholesterolaemia, detected during a cholesterol screening project, were randomly selected to receive dietary advice from a physician only (70 patients) or from a physician and a licensed dietitian (66 patients). . Patients were followed for 1 year to assess compliance with NCEP guidelines. RESULTS: At 3 months, the mean (+/- SD) decrease in serum LDL-C was 7% +/- 11% in the physician group and 12% +/- 10% in the dietitian group (P<0.004). A reduction in LDL-C levels of 10% or more was observed in 25 patients (36%) in the physician group and 43 patients (65%) in the dietitian group (p<0.001). Only 40 (29%) patients in both groups achieved their NCEP goals at 3 months. The majority of these were low-risk patients with an LDL cholesterol target of 160 mg/dL. After 12 months, both groups lost about half of the beneficial effect on LDL cholesterol levels, and the difference between the two groups narrowed. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels achieved by dietitian counseling is superior to that achieved by physicians. However, long-term compliance remains insufficient. In high-risk patients, a more aggressive dietary approach and possibly earlier introduction of lipid-lowering drugs should be considered.",0,0,
541,"Different indications, warnings and precautions, and contraindications for the same drug - an international comparison of prescribing information for commonly used psychotropic drugs","PURPOSE: Our goal is to derive an internationally applicable data set to improve the prescribing safety of psychotropic drugs. METHODS: We performed an in-depth analysis of the prescribing information concordance of 10 major psychiatric drugs in four major drug markets in terms of indications, warnings and precautions, and contraindications. RESULTS: The individual prescribing information covered an average of 71.4 +/- 30.3% of all indicated indications, 59.5 +/- 17.1% of all potential warnings and cautions, and 70.1 +/- 24.4% of all applicable ones contraindications. CONCLUSION: This significant variation in key prescribing information across countries underscores the need for better international collaboration and standardization of prescribing information.",0,0,
542,Distinguishing between normal speech disorder and stuttering in children,"The concept of stuttering refers to a lack of fluency or hesitation in a speech pattern. Incidence is reported as 1% worldwide, with a greater incidence in males to females (3:1). Theories of causation are briefly identified, including genetic predisposition and neurological factors. In the process of language acquisition, children of preschool age usually go through a transitional phase of language fluency disorder. This fact can make early stuttering behavior difficult to recognize, can be emotionally painful for the child, and can impair psychological development. The healthcare provider is in a key position to provide early diagnosis and intervention to the child with early stuttering. To do this, the healthcare provider must have the knowledge and ability to distinguish normal developmental disorder from early stuttering. Factors that distinguish these language patterns are identified along with referral guidelines. Current treatment modalities of speech therapists are described. Practical interventions that parents can offer to improve child fluency and reduce speech anxiety are summarized.",0,0,
543,Difficulties in implementing a mental health guideline: an exploratory study using psychological theory,"BACKGROUND: Evaluations of interventions to improve guideline implementation have not produced a clear pattern of outcomes that favors any particular method. While implementation depends on clinicians and managers changing a variety of behaviors, psychological theories of behavior and behavior change are rarely used to try to understand difficulties in implementation or to design interventions to overcome them. OBJECTIVES: This study applied psychological theory to explore explanations for implementation difficulties. It used a theoretical framework derived from an interdisciplinary consensus exercise to code interviews in 11 theoretical domains. The study focused on the recommendation of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence schizophrenia guideline that family interventions should be offered to the families of people with schizophrenia. METHODS: Participants were recruited from community mental health teams from three United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) trusts; 20 members (social workers, nurses, team managers, psychologists and psychiatrists) participated. Semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. The interview questions were based on the theoretical areas and addressed the respondents' knowledge, attitudes and opinions regarding the guideline. Two researchers independently coded the transcript segments from each interview related to each theoretical area. A score of 1 indicated that the transcript segments related to the domain did not appear to contain a description of difficulties in implementing family therapy guidelines;"" Similarly, a score of 0.5 indicates possible difficulties and a score of 0 indicates definite difficulties RESULTS: Coding respondents' responses to questions on the three areas of beliefs about consequences, social/professional role and identity, and motivation yielded the three highest overall scores, suggesting that factors related to these Areas not likely to pose difficulties in implementation “Environmental context and resources” was the lowest scoring area while “Emotions” scored the second lowest, suggesting that these are likely areas where intervention should be considered The two main resources that have been identified as problems n, were time and training. The emotions that appeared to potentially influence the offering of family therapy were self-doubt and fear. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study shows an approach to develop a theoretical understanding of implementation difficulties.",0,0,

Aim To determine whether risk factors such as demographics, trauma, health status and mental illness are associated with disabilities in Bosnian refugees. Design, Setting and Participants 1996 cross-sectional survey of adult Bosnian refugees living in a camp set up by the Croatian government near the city of Vara?din. One adult aged 18 or older was randomly selected from each of the 573 camp families; 534 (93%) agreed to participate (mean age 50 years; 41% male). Key Outcome Measures Culturally validated measures for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) included the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. Disability measures included the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 20, a physical functioning scale based on World Health Organization criteria, and self-reports on the socioeconomic activity, levels of physical energy, and perceived health outcomes Respondents reported a mean (SD) of 6.5 (4.7) unduplicated trauma events, 18% (n = 95) had experienced 1 or more torture events, while 55.2 % reported no psychiatric symptoms, 39.2% and 26.3% reported symptoms meeting dsm-iv criteria for depression and ptsd, respectively, 20.6% reported comorbid symptoms for both disorders, 25.5% overall reported having a disability with comorbid symptoms for both depression and PTSD w are associated with an increased risk of disability compared to asymptomatic refugees (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.02; 95% confidence interval Â¦Ã–, 3.05-8.26; adjusted or 2.06; 95%CI, 1.10-3.86).

547,Distinctive patterns of human immunodeficiency virus risk in healthy young adults,"Previous research has questioned the effectiveness of existing methods for identifying individuals at high risk of contracting and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, new approaches are needed to provide these individuals with risk reduction strategies. We review our research on young adult sexual decision-making using theories and methods from the social and cognitive sciences. Four patterns of condom use and associated risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest that it makes sense to tailor intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at greater risk of infection than they realize. Primary care physicians are the first port of call for many people in the healthcare system and may be in the best position to screen at-risk individuals. Given the time involved and other obstacles, easily applicable, evidence-based guidelines for such screening are needed. We propose such guidelines for general practitioners to identify individual risk from which tailored intervention strategies can be developed.",0,0,

Because there is little data to help physicians decide when it is safe and appropriate to discontinue ChEIs after long-term use, practices can vary widely. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among Canadian dementia professionals (geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, geriatricians) involved in clinical trials research. ChEI discontinuation recommendations were determined based on responses to questions about patient/caregiver preferences, administrative considerations, efficacy, and adverse events. RESULTS: There was a reasonable consensus that ChEIs should be discontinued based on patient and caregiver preference and in the presence of serious troublesome adverse events. There was much less consensus on issues related to effectiveness -- particularly what constitutes a larger-than-expected decline. There was a general reluctance to rely on a single measure of cognition, function, and/or behavior, and in particular the MMSE was considered unhelpful in making discontinuation decisions. CONCLUSION: Recommendations for stopping ChEIs after long-term use from a survey of dementia professionals are presented. Ideally, clinical practice guidelines based on controlled withdrawal studies are needed.",0,0,
550,Discussing randomized clinical trials of cancer therapy: assessment of a Cancer Research UK training programme,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an educational intervention aimed at improving how healthcare professionals communicate with cancer patients about randomized clinical trials. DESIGN: Before and after evaluation of the training program. SETTING: Members of the National Cancer Research Network, Scottish Trials Network and Welsh Cancer Trials Network. PARTICIPANTS: 101 health professionals (33 clinicians and 68 research nurses). INTERVENTION: Four modules, conducted by a trained facilitator using videotapes and interactive exercises, to address common issues in discussing randomized clinical trials involving patients, issues specific to adjuvant trials, trials aimed at palliation, and trials in which Patients had a strong preference for one treatment, covering arm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after the intervention, participants were videotaped discussing a study with an actor portraying a patient. These consultations were evaluated for the availability of information required by the guidelines for good clinical practice. The actor patients provided a rating after each interview. Participants reported their confidence in the most important aspects of the study discussion. RESULTS: Analysis of the videotaped consultations showed that after the intervention, significantly more participants engaged in important communication behaviors, such as B. Explaining randomization (69 vs , P=0.002) and discussing standard of care (73 vs 88, odds ratio 4.75, P=0.005) and side effects (69 vs 85, odds ratio 3.29, P= 0.006). Participants' confidence increased significantly in all domains (P < 0.001). Actor patient ratings of participant communication showed significant improvements for 12/15 key items. CONCLUSION: This intensive 8-hour intervention significantly improved participants' confidence and competence in communicating about randomized clinical trials.",0,0,
551,Discussion of sexual risk behaviors in HIV care is rare and appears ineffective: a mixed-methods study,"Consensus guidelines in HIV care encourage clinicians to provide a brief sexual risk behavior intervention at each visit. Studies based on participant reports note that this is rare, but studies based on direct observation of clinical encounters are lacking. We conducted a mixed-method study using audio recordings from 116 routine outpatient visits from 58 different patients with HIV at five different practice centers. Transcripts of the visits were coded and analyzed using a quantitative system. In addition, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the dialogue segments in which sexual risk behavior was discussed. Discussion of sexual risk behaviors took place on 10 visits and was generally quite brief. Two visits included extensive sexual risk reduction counseling"";"" two others contained a lengthy discussion that was not obviously aimed at the patient's changing behavior. At seven additional visits, there were indications of the need or opportunity for such an interview, which the physicians did not pursue. Interactions about sexual risks had less patient engagement than interactions about other health behaviors. Physicians rarely provide sexual risk reduction counseling in HIV care, even when specific indications exist.",0,0,

553,Dissemination of effectiveness and outcomes research,"Efficacy and outcomes research aims to improve patients' health outcomes by improving the quality of the healthcare they receive. Dissemination of the results of this research is a necessary step in this process. This paper provides an overview of what is known about the design and dissemination of effective information packs for healthcare providers (mainly physicians), where effectiveness means promoting behavioral change on the part of practitioners that leads to better patient care. Practice-relevant research information is made available to providers through the publication of randomized clinical trial results, the dissemination of consensus recommendations, the development and use of computer-assisted clinical decision-making tools, and the provision of continuing medical education. Each of these areas offers numerous examples of the extremely modest behavioral response that can be expected from the mere provision of information. The literature also offers some principles that can improve the chances of success, including the desirability of techniques that involve face-to-face interaction, encourage active learner participation, repeat the message, make recommendations explicit and relevant to clinical practice, and use of opinion leaders and peer influence. So far, little basic research has been carried out on the motives of the providers and the actual decision-making processes. Research aimed at promoting a behavioral science of providers could also provide new insights into effective dissemination strategies.",0,1,
554,Dissemination of evidence-based antipsychotic drug prescribing guidelines in nursing homes: A randomized cluster study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to translate and disseminate evidence-based guidelines on atypical use of antipsychotics in nursing homes (NHs). DESIGN: Three-arm, cluster-randomized study. SETTING: NH's. PARTICIPANTS: NHs in the state of Connecticut. MEASUREMENTS: Evidence-based guidelines for prescribing atypical antipsychotics were translated into a toolkit aimed at NH stakeholders, and 42 NHs were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three toolkit delivery strategies: toolkit mailing (minimum intensity), toolkit mailing with quarterly review and feedback reports on facility-level antipsychotic prescribing (moderate intensity);"" and personal toolkit delivery with academic details, on-site behavior management training, and quarterly audit and feedback reports (high intensity). Results were evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RESULTS: The toolkit awareness of 30% (7/23) of leaders of low-intensity NHs, 54% (19/35) of medium-intensity NHs, and 82% (18/22) of high-intensity NHs reflected adoption and implementation of the intervention. The highest levels of use and knowledge among direct care workers were reported in high-intensity NHs. Antipsychotic prescription amounts decreased over the study period, but there were no statistically significant differences between study arms or from secular trends. CONCLUSION: RE-AIM indicators suggest some success in disseminating the toolkit and differences in outreach, acceptance and implementation according to the dissemination strategy, but no measurable effect on antipsychotic prescription trends. Further dissemination to outside stakeholders such as mental health counselors and hospitals may be needed to influence antipsychotic prescription for NH residents.",0,1,
555,Do decision support systems affect prescription variation?,"BACKGROUND: The transfer of scientific knowledge into daily practice is problematic. All types of intervention strategies that use educational and/or directive strategies to change behavior have evolved, but have only been partially found to be successful. In this article, the focus is on (computer-aided) Decision Support Systems (DSSs). DSSs interfere with the day-to-day work of physicians, in contrast to interventions aimed at influencing knowledge in order to change behavior. We examined whether general practitioners (GPs) prescribe according to the recommendations of the DSS and whether there is less variation in prescribing when the DSS is used. Methods: Data from the Second Dutch National General Practice Survey (DNSGP2) from 2001 was used. A total of 82 diagnoses, 749811 contacts, 133 doctors and 85 practices were included in the analyses. General practitioners who use the DSS on a daily basis were compared to general practitioners who do not use the DSS. Multilevel analysis was used to analyze the data. Two outcome measures were chosen: whether or not the prescription met the recommendations of the DSS, and a measure of concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). RESULTS: Primary care physicians who use the DSS daily prescribe more according to the DSS recommendations than primary care physicians who do not use the DSS. Contrary to our expectation, there was no significant difference between the HHIs for either group: the variation in prescription was comparable. CONCLUSION: We investigated the use of a DSS for drug prescribing in general practice in the Netherlands. The DSS is based on guidelines developed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners and implemented in GPs' electronic medical systems. Primary care physicians who use the DSS are more likely to prescribe in accordance with the DSS recommendations than primary care physicians who do not use the DSS. However, this finding does not mean that the variation is less"";"" The variation is the same for GPs using a DSS and for GPs not using a DSS. Implications of the study are that DSSs can be used to implement policies, but should not be expected to be limited in variation.",0,1,
556,Do health care reforms affect the cost consciousness of health professionals? Results of a nationwide survey in the Balkans,"BACKGROUND: As the largest market in the Western Balkans, Serbia has entered socio-economic transition with a significant lag compared to most countries in Eastern Europe. Her efforts to reform the health system over the past 15 years have been bold, but her results have been contradictory in several areas. The two waves of global recession that hit the Balkan countries were ultimately reflected in the health care financial situation. Serious difficulties in providing accessible medical care to citizens became a reality. In fact, a large part of the unbearable expenditure is spent on the open prescription of medicines required by physicians and various laboratory and imaging diagnostic procedures. Therefore, a broad national survey was conducted at all levels of the healthcare system hierarchy to determine the ability of cost-containment strategies to reshape the mindset and decision-making of physicians in practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate health professionals' perceptions of the economic impact of prescribed medical interventions and to assess health professionals' responsiveness to cost-awareness policies. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: From January 2010 to April 2013, a nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted through a hierarchy of medical institutions in different geographic regions before and after policy interventions. In the middle of the observation period, the National Health Insurance Fund (RFZO) passed. strict cost containment measures. Independently, pharmacoeconomic guidelines for prescribing physicians have been disseminated. Administrations in large hospitals and community pharmacies have been forced to restrict access to medical care with heavy budget strains. The Questionnaire 29 on Economic Awareness of Health Professionals (EAHPQ-29), developed in Serbian, was used in face-to-face interviews. The questionnaire documented the physician's attitudes towards: clinical decision making between alternative interventions (CDMAI), quality of health care (QHC) and cost containment policy (CCP). The authors randomly and anonymously recruited 2000 health professionals, of whom 1487 responded; after eliminating incomplete surveys, 649 participants before and 651 after political intervention were included. RESULTS: Dentists (1.195 +/- 0.560) had a higher mean CDMAI score compared to physicians (1.017 +/- 0.453). The surgical group had a higher total EAHPQ-29 score, CCP score, and CDMAI score compared to the medical group. Political interference had a statistically significant negative impact on QHC score (F=4.958; df=1;"" p=0.027). There were no significant effects of political interference on professional behavior and judgment related to the CDMAI, CCP, and EAHPQ-29 overall scores CONCLUSION: Although cost savings were enforced in practice, the impact on clinical decision-making was modest Physicians' perceptions of the quality of medical care were compromised due to the severely limited resources allocated to providers, less effectively explained.This pioneering achievement in the Balkans reveals the inefficiency of current policies to expand clinicians' cost awareness.",0,0,
557,Do knowledge providers facilitate the implementation of the stroke guideline in clinical practice?,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of clinical guidelines in rehabilitation practice is often tedious and incomplete. One intervention to improve the implementation of guidelines is the knowledge transfer program built around the activities of a knowledge facilitator (KB). This study investigates the use of KBs to implement guideline recommendations for intensive therapy and physical activity for post-stroke patients at 22 stroke units in hospitals and rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. METHODS/DESIGN: This study included a quantitative assessment with an uncontrolled pre-post intervention design and a mixed-methods process assessment. Enterprising nurses and therapists are recruited from each stroke unit and trained as KB. The KB will work in its team on the implementation of the guideline recommendations for a year. To assess the effectiveness of KB, patients, healthcare professionals and KBs will be given a questionnaire at baseline (T0) and after one year (T1). In addition, semi-structured interviews of 5 KB are conducted at T1. The primary outcome of this implementation project will be the support of healthcare professionals who support patients to move and be physically active as self-reported by patients and healthcare professionals. Support immediately after the intervention is compared to support at the beginning of the intervention. In addition, we examine the influence of sociodemographic characteristics of health professionals and the determinants identified in the theory of planned behavior (intention, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) in changing the supportive behaviors of health professionals. Finally, the KBs complete a questionnaire about their own psychological and sociodemographic characteristics and organizational conditions needed for health care improvement, such as time, manpower, sponsorship, and management support. DISCUSSION: With this study we will gain insight into when and why knowledge brokers appear to be effective. Additionally, we will identify determinants that predict which healthcare professionals are vulnerable to behavior change. This study will provide guidance on how to implement guidelines and help improve stroke rehabilitation services.",0,0,
558,Do nurses have a different physical health profile? A systematic review of experimental and observational studies on the physical health of nurses,"AIM: To systematically review the evidence on nurse health. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the most important resources of a healthcare system. They are exposed to biological, socioeconomic, cultural and health system factors that determine their health. Although mental and physical health problems are prevalent among nurses, the literature is often contradictory. The literature on health care styles, health behaviors, and self-perceived health among caregivers is also unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review of experimental and observational studies of caregiver health. METHODS: 43 databases searched. Identified 2692 potentially interesting references"";"" 187 studies included. Only the results of physical health studies are presented. A meta-analysis was not possible. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system was used to assess evidence. RESULTS: Nurses were at greater risk of musculoskeletal injuries and more susceptible to bloodborne pathogens than other healthcare workers. They had a higher risk of breast cancer than other female healthcare workers. Nurses in hospitals were at higher risk of tuberculosis. They had no increased risk of cancer in general, Hodgkin's disease, gastric, colon, rectal, pancreatic, ovarian, kidney, brain or thyroid cancer, or lymphosarcoma. They have a higher prevalence of occupational allergies than office workers. DISCUSSION: Nursing workers are more likely to suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, consistent with the nature of nursing work. They are at a higher risk of contracting tuberculosis, particularly when working in pulmonary, medical or human immunodeficiency virus wards, which could be due to repeated exposure to infected patients. Nurses are also more susceptible to bloodborne pathogens, which could be explained by exposure during work. Susceptibility to occupational allergies can be explained by exposure to a range of chemical agents. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Without in-depth knowledge of nurse health, it is not possible to develop specific workplace health programs.",0,0,
559,Do pediatricians apply the 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Gastroesophageal Reflux After Being Trained?,"BACKGROUND: According to a recent survey, the guidelines of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition on gastroesophageal reflux are poorly followed by European primary care physicians. The main problem that emerged from the survey was the prescription of unnecessary acid-suppressing medications, particularly in infants. The reasons were not asked. The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the applicability of the guidelines among European primary care pediatricians undergoing specific training. METHODS: One hundred pediatricians participating in the previous survey agreed to participate and were randomly divided into two groups: one group was trained in the guidelines through an online podcast, and the other group was trained through a synopsis. During the following 3 months, each participating pediatrician was asked to enroll each successive infant, child, or adolescent with evidence of reflux symptoms. For each admitted patient, pediatricians completed a report detailing their diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients (boys/girls 186/196, infants/children/adolescents 194/123/65) were enrolled by paediatricians. Infants with unexplained crying and/or distressed behaviors who were prescribed proton pump inhibitors were 3.7% versus 45.2% of pre-exercise survey data (P<0.05). Infants with uncomplicated recurrent regurgitation and vomiting who were prescribed proton pump inhibitors were 4.5% versus 37.1% of baseline assessment data (p<0.05). The overall rate of children managed in full compliance with guidelines was 46.1% after training versus 1.8% before training (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between pediatricians from the podcast and synopsis groups. CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines of the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition – the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition – for gastroesophageal reflux have good applicability, although currently poor adherence to them by European primary care pediatricians. Simple, low-cost training has proven effective in increasing pediatrician adherence to therapy. The increase in compliance clearly favors the role of continuing medical education through simple training tools and subsequent assessment of practice.",0,1,
560,Do polypills lead to neglecting lifestyle risk factors? Results of a meta-analysis of individual participant data in 3140 patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether polypill-based treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with CVD or high calculated cardiovascular risk is associated with a change in lifestyle risk factors compared to usual care is. METHODS: We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis of three studies with patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand using a strategy using a polypill with aspirin, statin and antihypertensive therapy with usual care in patients compared to a previous CVD event or who were at high risk at their first event. The analyzes examined all the different effects on anthropometric measures and self-reported lifestyle habits. RESULTS: Among 3140 patients (75% male, mean age 62 years and 76% with a previous CVD event) there was no difference in lifestyle risk factors in those randomized to polypill-based treatment compared to usual Treatment for a median of 15 months, either across all participants or across a range of subgroups. In addition, narrow confidence intervals (CIs) ruled out larger impacts"";"" For example, differences between groups in body mass index were -0.1 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.1) kg/m2, in weekly duration of moderate-intensity physical activity -2 ( -26 to 23) minutes and the proportion of smokers was 16% versus 17% (RR 0.98, 0.84 to 1.15) at the end of the study. DISCUSSION: This analysis dispels concerns that polypill-based treatment might lead to neglect of lifestyle risk factors, at least in high-risk patients. Maximum effective preventive approaches should consider lifestyle factors alongside pharmaceutical interventions, as recommended by major international guidelines.",0,0,
561,Documentation-based clinical decision support to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care: a randomized controlled cluster study,"Background and Aim Clinical guidelines advise against prescribing antibiotics for many acute respiratory infections (ARIs), particularly for non-antibiotic-suitable diagnoses. Clinical decision support based on Electronic Medical Records (EHR) has the potential to improve antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. Methods We randomly assigned 27 primary care clinics to receive an EMR-integrated, documentation-based clinical decision support system for the care of patients with ARIs - the ARI Smart Form - or to provide usual care. The primary outcome was the antibiotic prescription rate for ARIs in an analysis of intention to intervention based on administrative diagnoses. Results During the intervention period, patients made 21,961 ARI visits to study sites. Intervention physicians used the ARI Smart Form in 6% of 11,954 ARI visits. The antibiotic prescribing rate in the intervention clinics was 39% versus 43% in the control clinics (odds ratio (OR) 0.8 inches; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6_1.2, adjusted for clustering by clinic). For antibiotics with reasonable ARI diagnoses, the antibiotic prescription rate was 54% in the intervention clinics and 59% in the control clinics (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5_1.3). % in the intervention clinics and 34% in the control clinics (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6_1.4) Using the ARI Smart Form, the antibiotic prescription rate based on the diagnoses recorded in the form was 49% overall 88 % for antibiotic-eligible diagnoses and 27% for non-antibiotic-eligible diagnoses. In an as-used analysis, the ARI Smart Form was associated with a lower antibiotic prescription rate for acute bronchitis (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3_0.8). Conclusions The ARI Smart Form did not reduce overall antibiotic prescribing nor significantly improve the adequacy of antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, but it was not widely used. When used, the ARI Smart Form can improve diagnostic accuracy compared to administrative diagnoses and reduce antibiotic prescribing for certain diagnoses.",0,1,
562,Joint development and dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines improves prescribing behavior: a pre/post study with concurrent controls and a randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Controlling prescribing behavior in primary care practices is difficult. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a dissemination strategy of multidisciplinary guidelines on drug prescription volumes. METHODS: The study included two designs, a quasi-experimental pre/post study with a concurrent control group and a random sample of primary care physicians within the intervention group. The intervention area with 53 general practitioners was compared with a control group of 54 randomly selected general practitioners in the south and center of the Netherlands. In addition, the intervention group was randomized to form two arms with 27 general practitioners who were more intensively involved in the development of the guideline and 26 general practitioners in the control group. A multidisciplinary committee developed prescribing guidelines. These guidelines were then distributed to all general practitioners in the intervention region. Additional effects were examined in the subgroup study, in which general practitioners were invited to become more involved in the guideline development process. The guidelines contained 14 recommendations on antibiotics, asthma/COPD medications and cholesterol medications. The main outcome measures were prescribing dates over a three-year period (one year before and 2 years after the dissemination of the guideline) and the rate of change according to the recommendations. RESULTS: Significant short-term improvements were observed with one recommendation: mupirocin. Long-term changes have been noted in the prescription of cholesterol medications. No additional changes were observed in the subgroup for the randomized controlled trial. General practitioners did not accept the invitation to participate.

563,Joint development and dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines improves prescribing behavior: a pre/post study with concurrent controls and a randomized study.,"Background It is difficult to control prescribing behavior in primary care practices. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a dissemination strategy of multidisciplinary guidelines on drug prescription volumes. Methods The study included two designs, a quasi-experimental pre/post study with a concurrent control group and a random sample of primary care physicians within the intervention group. The intervention area with 53 general practitioners was compared with a control group of 54 randomly selected general practitioners in the south and center of the Netherlands. In addition, the intervention group was randomized to form two arms with 27 general practitioners who were more intensively involved in the development of the guideline and 26 general practitioners in the control group. A multidisciplinary committee developed prescribing guidelines. These guidelines were then distributed to all general practitioners in the intervention region. Additional effects were examined in the subgroup study, in which general practitioners were invited to become more involved in the guideline development process. The guidelines contained 14 recommendations on antibiotics, asthma/COPD medications and cholesterol medications. The main outcome measures were prescribing dates over a three-year period (one year before and two years after publication of the guideline) and the rate of change according to the recommendations. Results Significant short-term improvements were observed with one recommendation: mupirocin. Long-term changes have been noted in the prescription of cholesterol medications. No additional changes were observed in the subgroup for the randomized controlled trial. General practitioners did not accept the invitation to participate. Conclusion The dissemination of multidisciplinary guidelines developed within a region does not have a clear impact on prescribing behavior, although GPs and specialists have been more involved in their development.

564,Does methadone maintenance therapy work according to the new national guidelines in primary care?,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) are encouraged to treat more drug users, but there are few studies demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care. AIM: To determine whether patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment for a year in a modern UK primary care setting can achieve similar harm reduction outcomes with prescription protocols based on the new national guidance as in other settings, using objective outcome measures available. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: The Drug Dependence Primary Care Clinic, Sheffield. METHOD: The intervention consisted of methadone maintenance treatment administered by primary care physicians with prescribing protocols based on the 1999 national guidelines. The first 96 eligible consenting patients entering treatment were recruited"";"" 65 graduated. Outcome measures included current drug use, HIV risk behavior, social functioning, criminal activity, and mental and physical health, supplemented by urinalysis and criminal record data. Results: The frequency of heroin use was reduced (Chi 2 = 79.48, degrees of freedom) from an average of 3.02 episodes per day (standard deviation [SD] = 1.73) to an average of 0.22 episodes per day (SD = 0.54). [df ] = 2, P<0.001), confirmed by urinalysis. The mean number of convictions and warnings was reduced by 62% (z=3.378, P<0.001) for all offenses. HIV risk behaviors, social functioning, and physical and psychological well-being all showed significant improvements. CONCLUSION: Patients receiving methadone maintenance therapy in a primary care setting for one year may experience improvements in a range of harm reduction outcomes similar to those shown in studies in other, often more structured programs.",0,0,
565,Does publication bias increase the apparent effectiveness of psychological treatment for major depressive disorder? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the US National Institutes of Health-Funded Trials,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of antidepressants is empirically overestimated due to publication bias, but this has only been statistically deduced with regard to the psychological treatment of depression. We directly assessed the extent of study publication bias in studies examining the effectiveness of psychological treatment for depression. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified US National Institutes of Health grants to fund randomized clinical trials comparing psychological treatment with control disorders or other treatments in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder over the period 1972-2008, and determined whether these Grants led to publications. For unpublished studies, data were requested from the investigators and included in the meta-analyses. Thirteen (23.6%) of the 55 funded grants that began studies did not result in publications, and two others never began. Among the comparisons with control conditions, adding unpublished studies (Hedges' g=0.20""; CI95% -0.11~0.51; k=6) to published studies (g=0.52; 0.37~) reduced 0.68; k = 20) the psychotherapy effect size point estimate (g = 0.39; "" 0.08~0.70) by 25%. Furthermore, these results may overestimate the ""true"" effect of psychological treatment for depression, since the bias in outcome reporting could not be quantitatively examined. Conclusion: The effectiveness of psychological interventions in depression is overestimated in the published literature, as is that of pharmacotherapy. Both are effective, but not to the extent that the published literature suggests. Funding agencies and journals should archive both original protocols and raw data from treatment studies to enable detection and correction of bias in outcome reporting. Clinicians, guideline developers, and policy makers should be aware that the published literature overestimates the impact of prevalent treatments for depression.",0,0,
566,Does screening for and intervention for multiple unhealthy behaviors and mental health disorders in young people attending primary care improve health outcomes? A systematic overview,"BACKGROUND: Adolescence and young adulthood are important developmental periods. Screening for unhealthy behaviors and mental disorders during routine primary care visits can help clinicians identify problem areas and take appropriate action. The aim of this systematic review is to examine whether screening and follow-up interventions for multiple unhealthy behaviors and mental health disorders in primary care improve health outcomes in young people. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, literature searches were performed in the Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases (Prospero registration number CRD42013005828) using search terms representing four thematic concepts : Primary care, adolescents, screening, and behaviors that affect mental health and health. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to: include a measure of health outcome; include at least 75% of participants under the age of 25; use a screening tool that assesses more than one area of health;” and be conducted in a primary care setting. Risk of bias was assessed using the quality rating scale. RESULTS: Out of 5051 articles identified, nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one pilot RCT, two clustered RCTs, one randomized trial with multiple intervention groups and no control group, one cluster RCT with two active arms , a longitudinal study and a pre-post study. Seven studies, including two RCTs and one clustered RCT, found positive changes in substance use, diet, sexual health or risky sexual behaviors, alcohol-related risky behaviors, social stress, coping with stress, helmet use, sleep, and exercise. Of only two studies that reported harm, one reported negative health effects of increased alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that the use of screening and intervention in young people for mental disorders or unhealthy behaviors in clinical settings improves health outcomes. Along with other evidence that young people value discussions about health risks with their providers, these discussions should be part of young people's routine primary care. More quality studies are needed to substantiate this evidence.",0,0,
567,Does Shared Care Help Treat Depression?,"INTRODUCTION: Shared or collaborative care in the management of depression is an evidence-based intervention that has been shown to be more effective than usual GP care in the management of depression, but is not yet part of UK government policy. Our goal was to bring together in one place all studies conducted up to mid-2009 to provide evidence that shared collaborative care has important benefits both in terms of depression outcomes and the cost benefits to do so argue the adoption of this approach in the UK and Europe. Methods: We performed a literature search using PUBMED to identify and describe all studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses that had been performed on shared care up to mid-2009. We also described a shared care service for depression that some of us helped develop and work in Luton in the late 1990s. We excluded articles that describe studies that have not yet been conducted and instead focused on the studies that have been reported. RESULTS: Numerous recent studies have shown that shared care in the management of depression, which includes training general practitioners in the management of depression and providing a specialist nurse or other primary care worker, provides psycho-education, ensures the Medication concordance and the provision of psychotherapy, if necessary, leads to improved treatment outcomes as well as increased doctor and patient satisfaction and offers some cost advantages despite slightly increased direct costs. This is the case in both adult and adolescent patients, while in diabetics, depression is ameliorated despite the lack of improvement in glycemic control. In patients with resistant depressive symptoms, the shared care intervention is still useful, but longer input is required in such cases. Patients with underlying depression do not benefit as much, and patients reported greater satisfaction when psychological interventions were offered. It is also true that cooperative or shared caregiving is effective in treating depression in the elderly. This is shown by studies involving elderly patients who also suffer from multiple health conditions, arthritis, diabetes, anxiety and PTSD, the poorer, those with suicidal thoughts and also ethnic minorities. DISCUSSION: The findings described above are based primarily on studies conducted in the US, but similar studies have been reported from the UK and are consistent with the experiences of the Luton ministry that we describe. Based on these findings, it appears important that shared, collaborative care with primary and secondary care physicians (GPs and psychiatrists) work as part of a single team, with the help of psychiatrists attached to, but easy access to, primary care Having secondary care is a productive way to optimize treatment for depression. However, the UK has not yet succeeded in developing such a service for the whole population. This is because in the UK, primary care trusts manage general medicine, while mental health trusts manage secondary care, including psychiatry. This has prompted the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence, and indeed local care officials, to focus on a tiered model for treating depression, with a key issue being access (or referral) to secondary care and discharge back to primary care is, with a group of mental health workers focused on facilitating (or overseeing) these processes, rather than focusing on actually optimizing treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: The evidence supports the development of collaborative care between primary and secondary care for the treatment of depression. This requires common medication guidelines in both primary and secondary care, easy access to allow general practitioners to receive advice from psychiatrists about patients, and the engagement of mental health professionals to provide patients with psychoeducation, support for compliance with treatment and to offer psychotherapy. To achieve this, services may need to be restructured to allow for easy communication between professionals.",0,0,
568,"Does therapeutic writing help people with long-term illnesses? Systematic review, realistic synthesis and economic considerations","BACKGROUND: Writing therapy to improve physical or mental health can take many forms. The best-researched model of therapeutic writing (TW) is unaided, individually expressive writing (written emotional disclosure). Facilitated writing activities are less well researched. DATA SOURCES: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched from inception to March 2013 (updated January 2015). REVIEW METHODS: Four TW practitioners offered expert advice. Study procedures were carried out by one reviewer and reviewed by a second. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative studies were included. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Unfacilitated and facilitated TW studies were analyzed separately under the chapter headings of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Wherever possible, meta-analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.2.6 (RevMan 2012, The Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Costs were estimated from the UK NHS perspective and three cost-consequence case studies were produced. The realistic synthesis followed the guidelines of Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards. OBJECTIVES: To review the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of TW for people with long-term conditions (LTCs) compared to no writing or other controls, reporting all relevant clinical outcomes. Conduct a realistic synthesis to understand how TW might work and for whom. RESULTS: Out of 14,658 unique citations, 284 full-text articles were reviewed and 64 studies (59 RCTs) were included in the final efficacy reviews. Five studies examined facilitated TW""; these were extremely heterogeneous with unclear or high risk of bias, but suggested that facilitated TW interventions might be beneficial in individual LTCs. Unfacilitated expressive writing was assessed in 59 studies with variable or unreported quality Overall, there was very little or no evidence of benefit reported for the following conditions (number of studies): human immunodeficiency virus (six), breast cancer (eight), gynecological and genitourinary cancers (five), mental health (five), asthma (four) psoriasis (three) and chronic pain (four) In inflammatory arthropathies (six), there was a reduction in disease severity [n=191, standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0 .96 to - 0.26] in the short term on meta-analysis of four studies. For all other LTCs there were either no data or sparse data with ke inconsistent or conflicting evidence of benefit. Meta-analyses performed across all LTCs provided no evidence that unaided emotional writing had short- (n=1563, SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.17, significant heterogeneity ) or long-term (n = 778, SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.10, little heterogeneity) effects on depression follow-up or on anxiety, physiological or biomarker-based outcomes. One study reported cost, no study reported cost-effectiveness, and 12 studies reported resource use,” and a meta-analysis suggested reduced medication use but no impact on health center visits. Estimated intervention costs were low, but there was insufficient evidence to judge cost-effectiveness. The results of the realistic synthesis suggested that facilitated TW is a complex intervention and the group interaction contributes to the perception of benefit. From the available data, it was unclear who could benefit most from facilitated TW. LIMITATION: Difficulties in developing the theory of the realistic synthesis program meant that mechanisms operating during TW remain unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is little evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy or cost-effectiveness of unassisted expressive writing interventions in people with LTCs. Further research focusing on facilitated TW in people with LTCs could be instructive. STUDY REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD420120033 43.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Hand searches of professional journals and searches of electronic databases, conference proceedings and bibliographies up to April 2006; Contacts to dressing manufacturers for unpublished studies. REVIEWED STUDIES All randomized controlled trials evaluating dressings for venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. Data from eligible studies were extracted and pooled independently by two reviewers using a data extraction sheet Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers RESULTS The search strategy identified 254 studies, 42 of which met the inclusion criteria Hydrocolloids were no more effective than simple weakly adherent dressings that be used under compression (eight trials; relative risk of healing with hydrocolloid 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.28). For other comparisons, insufficient evidence was available to draw firm conclusions. None of the dressing comparisons showed evidence that any particular dressing class healed more ulcers. There were some differences in subjective outcome measures and ulcer healing rates between associations. The results were not influenced by the size or quality of the studies or the unit of randomization. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the relative cost-effectiveness of different dressings. CONCLUSIONS The type of dressing placed under compression was not shown to affect ulcer healing. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the application of hydrocolloid dressings under compression did not provide any advantage in terms of ulcer healing compared to the application of simple, low-adhesion dressings. No final recommendations can be made as to which type of dressing is most cost effective. Decisions about which dressing to apply should be based on local dressing costs and physician or patient preferences.",0,0,
571,"Driving simulators for occupational therapy screening, assessment and intervention","Simulation technology provides safe, objective, and repeatable performance measurements related to operational (e.g., collision avoidance) or tactical (e.g., lane keeping) driver behavior. Many occupational therapy researchers and others use driving simulators to test a variety of applications in different populations. A growing body of literature supports associations between simulated driving and actual on-road driving. A limitation of simulator technology is the incidence of simulator sickness, but management strategies exist to contain or mitigate its onset. Based on the literature review and a consensus process, five consensus statements are presented to support the use of driving simulation technology among occupational therapists. The evidence suggests that by using driving simulators, occupational therapists can identify underlying impairments in driving performance, can identify driving errors in risk drivers, can distinguish between driving performance of impaired and healthy control groups, can show driving errors with absolute and relative validity in comparison to on-road studies; and to mitigate the incidence of simulator sickness. Great strides have been made in the use of driving simulation technology among occupational therapy researchers and practitioners."" However, empirical support is needed to further justify the use of driving simulators in clinical real-world settings as a valid, reliable, clinically useful, and cost-effective tool for driving assessment and intervention.",0,0,

574,Drug use and the role of patients and prescribers,"In order to achieve rational drug use in any national or local setting, research methods need to be expanded. Both the public and private sectors need to be addressed. In the latter, the pharmacists could be examined using a tracer, a fictitious customer. An important factor influencing the prescription, the drug information, has hardly been scientifically investigated. However, experimental studies with group randomization are also feasible in developing countries. The individual person must be the focus of drug studies and health care and health must be the focus. The combination of qualitative and quantitative methods will help us achieve rational drug use that is culturally acceptable, economically feasible, and pharmacologically sound.""; PIP: In an effort to promote rational drug use in local or national settings, particularly in developing countries improve The behavior of prescribers and users is the subject of the least research The effectiveness of medicines depends on a complex set of factors involved in the prescribing and acquisition situation One aspect that needs to be examined is the information that prescribers receive from drug advertisers and retailers, a shortage that is being addressed by an international network of prescribing doctors.In many countries, private sector pharmacies are the largest outlet for medicines, where medicines are often dispensed without a prescription ten diseases such as diarrhea in infants There are many factors involved in prescribing;"" the process must be studied with an epidemiological approach, ie through description, analysis, intervention and evaluation. Standard treatment plans, essential drug lists, and targeted interventions with treatment guidelines should be reviewed by local therapeutic committees. Drug information should also be evaluated scientifically using the same principles of analysis. The experimental method of group randomization is suggested as a viable choice for developing countries. This technique involves observing or interviewing groups of physicians and collecting quantitative outcome data. The behavior of individual users is best studied from a case study perspective by combining anthropological and biomedical approaches. An example of a problem amenable to this approach is the potential use of shorter antibiotic treatment cycles to reduce the risk of developing resistant organisms.",0,0,
575,DRUGS system to improve adherence to antibiotic use guidelines by Chinese surgeons during the perioperative period,"OBJECTIVE: The irrational use of antimicrobials to prevent postoperative SSIs is a widespread phenomenon in China, leading to more bacterial resistance, higher hospital infection rates, and additional antimicrobial costs. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of the Drug Rational Usage Guidelines System (DRUGS) on the prescribing behavior of surgeons with antimicrobial agents. METHODS: 10 common surgical procedures with 1543 cases (whereby 778 cases with paper-based guidelines and 765 cases with DRUGS) were selected and their demographic and clinical data were collected. The surgeries selected included thyroid resection, breast mass resection, myomectomy, etc. The evaluation criteria were antibiotic administration categories, timing of loading dose, duration of administration, length of stay, cost of antibiotics, SSIs, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). . RESULTS: The antimicrobials were administered mostly within 0.5 h to 2 h before the incision, 656 patients (85.75%) were intervened with drugs and 256 (32.90%) with paper-based guidelines according to the protocol. For clean wound incision, 547 patients (91.62%) were within 24 hours of stopping antibiotics with paper-based guidelines compared to 91 (14.79%) with the use of DRUGS. A total of 19 types of antibiotics were used in the 1543 cases. The top three on the frequency list were piperacillin and sulbactam sodium, cefathiamidine and cefoperazone. After the intervention, the frequency list changed to cefazolin, cefathiamidine, cefoperazone. Mean hospital stays were (7.00 +/- 4.31) days with paper-based guidelines and (2.54 +/- 1.57) days with DRUGS. The average cost of antibiotics was yen (3481.36 +/- 2584.46) with paper-based guidelines and yen (1693.39 +/- 1478.27) with DRUGS, respectively. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of SSIs and ADRs between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, the increased availability of antibiotic guidelines at the time of medication ordering, combined with DRUGS, was associated with improved surgeon adherence to guidelines.",0,0,
576,Durable improvements in prostate cancer screening through online spaced education in a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is often performed contrary to clinical practice guidelines. BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that an email-based intervention called ""spaced education"" could reduce inappropriate screening of clinicians for prostate cancer. DESIGN: The study was conducted as an RCT. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study enrolled 95 primary care clinicians at eight Veterans Affairs medical centers from January 2007 to February 2009 (2 emails per week), while control physicians received no intervention. Each email presented a clinical scenario and asked if it was appropriate to get a PSA test. Participants received feedback immediately after submitting their answers. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number and percentage of inappropriate PSA screening tests ordered. The use of PSA for prostate cancer screening in patients aged > 76 or < 40 years was defined as inappropriate testing. Screening adequacy was dichotomized based on the patient's age at the time of screening. Patients with PSA testing for non-screening reasons were excluded using a validated protocol. Logistic regression was performed with physician adjustment for patient grouping. The analyzes were carried out in 2009. RESULTS: During the intervention period (weeks 1-36), clinicians who received time-limited educational emails ordered significantly fewer inappropriate PSA screening tests than control clinicians (10.5% vs. 14.2%, p=0.041 ). During the 72-week post-intervention period (weeks 37-108), physicians with distance training continued to order fewer inappropriate tests compared to controls (7.8% vs. 13.1%, p=0.011), indicating a relative reduction in inappropriateness by 40% corresponds to screening. CONCLUSIONS: Spaced education consistently improves physicians' prostate cancer screening behavior and represents a promising new method to improve patient care in all health care systems.",1,1,
577,Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: 20-year longitudinal analysis in the Framingham Heart Study,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether happiness can spread from person to person and whether happiness niches are forming in social networks. DESIGN Longitudinal Analysis of Social Networks. SETTING Framingham Heart Study social network. PARTICIPANTS From 1983 to 2003, 4739 people followed. wide range of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. RESULTS Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness spans up to three degrees of separation (e.g., to friends of friends of one's friends). People who are surrounded by many happy people and those who are the focus of the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just from people's tendency to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile and becomes happy increases the likelihood that a person will be happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are found for spouses of the same age (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%) and next-door neighbors (34%, 7% to 70 %) observed. There are no visible effects between colleagues. The effect wears off with time and geographic separation. CONCLUSIONS People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected. This provides further justification for seeing happiness, like health, as a collective phenomenon.",0,0,
578,"Dyslipidemia in Primary Care – Prevalence, Detection, Treatment and Control: Data from the German Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Project (GEMCAS)","BACKGROUND: Current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines define low thresholds for the diagnosis of dyslipidemia using total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as guides for treatment. Although primarily a preventive tool, its thresholds are difficult to achieve in clinical practice, particularly in primary care. Methods: In a nationwide study with 1,511 general practitioners and 35,869 patients, we determined the prevalence of dyslipidemia, its detection, treatment and control rates. Diagnosis of dyslipidemia was based on TC and LDL-C. Basic descriptive statistics and prevalence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: Dyslipidemia was very common in primary care (76% overall). Doctors diagnosed dyslipidemia in 48.6% of male and 39.9% of female patients. However, lifestyle interventions controlled dyslipidemia in only about 10% of patients. A higher proportion (34.1% of men and 26.7% of women) were controlled on pharmacotherapy. The odds of being diagnosed and subsequently controlled using pharmacotherapy were higher in men (PRR 1.15""; 95% CI 1.12-1.17), in patients with concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with hypertension (PRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.37), and cardiovascular disease (PRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.29-1.64), prior myocardial infarction (PRR 1.32, 95% CI 1, 19-1.47) and if patients knew they were hypertensive (PRR 1.18; 95% CI 1.04-1.34) or knew about their previous myocardial infarction (PRR 1.17; 95% CI 1. 23-1.53). CONCLUSIONS: ESC thresholds appear difficult to meet. Simply requesting more aggressive treatment or greater patient compliance does not appear to be sufficient to increase the proportion of patients controlled. A shift towards a multifactorial treatment considering lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy for weight and lipid reduction, ka nn be the only way in a population where simply being normal is certainly not ideal.",0,0,

DESIGN Single-blind, randomized, controlled, multisite study. RECRUITMENT Diverse services across five UK locations. PARTICIPANTS 288 participants aged 14-35 years (mean 20.74, SD 4.34 years) at high risk of psychosis: 144 were assigned to cognitive therapy plus mental status monitoring and 144 to mental status monitoring only. Participants were followed up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months. INTERVENTION Cognitive therapy (up to 26 (mean 9.1) sessions over six months) plus mental status monitoring versus mental status monitoring alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome were the results of the Comprehensive Assessment of Mental Risk States (CAARMS), which provides a dichotomous transition to the psychosis score and the ordinal scores for the severity of psychotic symptoms and distress. Secondary endpoints were emotional dysfunction and quality of life. RESULTS Transition to psychosis based on treatment intention was analyzed using discrete time survival models. Overall, the transition prevalence was lower than expected (23/288; 8%), with no significant difference between the two groups (proportional odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 1.68). Changes in symptom severity and distress and secondary endpoints were analyzed using random effects regression (analysis of covariance) adjusted for site and baseline symptoms. Stress from psychotic symptoms was not different (estimated difference at 12 months -3.00, 95% confidence interval -6.95 to 0.94), but its severity was significantly reduced in the group assigned to cognitive therapy (estimated effect size between groups according to 12 months -3.67, -6.71 to -0.64, P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive therapy plus surveillance did not significantly reduce the transition to psychosis or symptom-related distress, but it did reduce the severity of psychotic symptoms in high-risk young people.

Recommendations for appropriate referrals and initiation of early intervention (EI) are also made. DATA SOURCES: Review of the published literature on ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ASD exhibit impaired social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication deficits, and repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped patterns of behavior or interests. Studies show that these children benefit from starting intensive EI as soon as possible. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Early detection allows children with suspected ASD to be evaluated by specialists and enrolled in treatment programs at the earliest possible time. Because of the importance of early diagnosis of ASD, it is critical that NPs use established screening tools to maximize the time and increase the reliability of the assessment.",0,0,

584,Early training to combat obesity in patients: a systematic review of nursing education,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to identify studies that have evaluated educational interventions in nursing education related to obesity and to examine the effectiveness of the interventions. BACKGROUND: Obesity is a prominent global problem and nurses play an increasingly important role in managing patients' weight. The literature has identified several theory-based behavior modification techniques that successfully support weight management in patients. Therefore, training nurses in obesity-related behavior modification techniques is appropriate to prepare them for their future professional role. However, the effectiveness of these educational interventions has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: The guidelines of the Center for Reviews and Dissemination informed about this systematic review. Four databases were systematically searched and the articles evaluated using inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment forms were developed and completed to identify salient features in the articles. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Only two included both baseline and outcome measures, one of which was a randomized controlled trial. In addition, only one study included an explicitly identified behavior modification technique. The interventions were delivered through a range of methods, but quality assessment showed that all studies had poor methodologies and were at high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Studies in this research area are sparse and methodologically not robust. Therefore, it is not possible to identify effective educational weight management interventions for nursing students. IMPLICATION: More robust research is needed to examine how nurses can be trained to facilitate weight management. Greater transparency of intervention descriptions, particularly with respect to what behavior change techniques were taught, would allow for replication and appropriate evaluation. Until then, it is not known whether current teaching adequately equips nurses to deal with obese and overweight patients.",0,0,
585,Early treatment of migraine attacks with triptans: a strategy to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction?,"Early treatment of migraine attacks with triptans can be more effective than late administration of the triptan. However, in published studies, the definition of ""early"" has varied (in terms of time, pain intensity, or the presence of allodynia) or is unclear. Therefore, no clear clinical indications have been identified. Appropriately designed studies to address this issue remain a priority. Early treatment with triptans can also have disadvantages, including inadvertently treating tension-type headaches and the risk of drug overuse. Currently, only those migraine sufferers with rapid pain worsening, high pain recurrence rate, and clinical signs of allodynia should be encouraged to take triptans as soon as possible. This recommendation implies the need for patient education and the need to carefully tailor treatment to individual needs.",0,0,
586,Eating disorders in children and adolescents: pharmacological therapies,"Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are present in childhood, often begin in adolescence, and can have serious medical and psychiatric consequences that impede physical, emotional, and behavioral development. Although we use the same definitions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Version 4 [DSM-IV] to diagnose eating disorders in children, adolescents, and adults, these disorders may present somewhat differently in younger populations, requiring appropriate assessment and Treatment required are tailored to their developmental needs. In recent years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the treatment of eating disorders in adults, and in particular the pharmacological management of these disorders. Several double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have documented the short-term effectiveness of antidepressants in bulimia nervosa. While the usefulness of pharmacological treatments for the acute management of anorexia nervosa is less clear, recent evidence suggests a role for drugs in the relapse prevention phase of the disease. The majority of drug studies for eating disorders have been conducted in adults, and the literature on pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents with these disorders is very limited. This review article summarizes the current literature on the role of drugs in the management of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, with a particular focus on studies conducted in children and adolescents.",0,0,
587,"Eating disorders in the context of preconception care: Knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices of fertility specialists","OBJECTIVE(S): To measure the knowledge, clinical practices and training needs of fertility professionals related to eating disorders. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Fertility clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty Australian and New Zealand fertility specialists who were members of the Fertility Society of Australia. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Responses to an anonymously completed online questionnaire. RESULT(S): Approximately 54% of physicians correctly identified body mass index relevant to anorexia nervosa and 30% identified menstrual disorders for anorexia, while 63.8% of physicians misappropriated weight control behavior as a feature of binge eating designated disorder. While clinicians (83.7%) agreed that it was important to screen for eating disorders during preconception evaluation, 35% routinely screened for eating disorders and 8.8% reported that their clinics follow clinical practice guidelines for eating disorder management to have. A minority of participants (13.8%) were satisfied with their educational level in eating disorders, 37.5% of physicians felt confident in their ability to recognize eating disorder symptoms, and 96.2% reported a need for further education and clinical guidelines at. For most of the items examined, knowledge and clinical practice regarding eating disorders did not differ based on the physician's gender or years of clinical experience as a fertility specialist. Conclusion(s): Knowledge about eating disorders in the context of fertility treatment is important. This study underscores the uncertainty among fertility specialists in recognizing characteristics of eating disorders. Findings point to the importance of continuing education and training, including the development of clinical guidelines specific to fertility health providers.",0,0,
588,Economic analyzes of the Be Fit Be Well program: a weight loss program for community health centers,"BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued new guidelines on obesity that encourage primary care physicians to provide intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions to obese patients. However, there are few studies of weight loss in primary care non-academic settings in the real world, and even fewer in predominantly racial/ethnic minority and low-income samples. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the recruitment, intervention, and repeat costs of a 2-year moderate-intensity weight loss and blood pressure control intervention. DESIGN: A comprehensive cost analysis was performed associated with a weight loss and hypertension management program implemented at three community health centers as part of a pragmatic randomized trial. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and sixty-five high-risk, low-income, inner-city minority patients (71% were Black/African American and 13% Hispanic) who were both hypertensive and obese. MAIN MEASURES: Measures included total recruitment and intervention costs, costs per participant, and incremental costs per unit of weight and blood pressure reduction. MAIN RESULTS: Recruitment and intervention costs were estimated at $2,359 per participant for the 2-year program. Compared to the control intervention, the cost per extra kilogram lost was $2,204/kg and for blood pressure $621/mmHg. Sensitivity analyzes suggest that if the program were offered to a larger sample and minor changes were made, the cost per participant could be reduced to the levels of many commercially available products. CONCLUSIONS: The costs associated with the Be Fit Be Well program were significantly higher than many commercially available products and much higher than the amount that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid reimburses physicians for obesity counseling. However, given the serious and costly health consequences associated with obesity in high-risk, multimorbid, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients, the resources required for interventions such as those described here may still prove cost-effective in bringing about long-term behavior change.",0,0,
589,Economic evaluation of implementation strategies in healthcare,"Economic assessments can make decisions about efficiency and allocation of resources to implementation strategies. Strategies specifically designed to educate caregivers and patients about the best available research and improve its use in their practices. These strategies are becoming increasingly popular in healthcare, especially given growing concerns about quality of care and limited resources. But such concerns have done little to motivate public health agencies and other decision-makers to invest in some form of economic evaluation in their assessments of implementation strategies. This editorial addresses the importance of economic evaluation in the context of implementation science, specifically how these analyzes can most efficiently be integrated into decision-making processes about implementation strategies.",0,0,
590,Economic implications of evidence-based hypertension prescribing: can better care cost less?,"Context Deviations from evidence-based guidelines in the management of hypertension are common, but their economic implications have not been thoroughly investigated. Suboptimal prescription patterns contribute to the high cost of medications for older patients and the difficulty in providing affordable prescription drug benefits to older Americans. Objective To calculate the potential savings from a healthcare payer perspective that would result from increased adherence to evidence-based recommendations for treating hypertension in patients over 65 years of age. Design Comparative analysis of prescribed medications with potential therapies suggested by evidence-based guidelines tailored to each patient's medical history, with calculation of costs of both actual and evidence-based therapies. Environment and Patients In 2001, a total of 133,624 patients were treated for hypertension enrolled in a large government drug assistance program that provides insurance for prescription drugs to the elderly. Main outcome measure Cost difference between drugs actually prescribed and treatment regimens suggested by evidence-based guidelines. Results The patients studied filled more than 2.05 million prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs in 2001, at an annual program cost of US$48.5 million (US$363 per patient). We identified 815,316 prescriptions (40%) for which an alternative regimen appeared more appropriate according to evidence-based recommendations. Such changes would have reduced payer costs by $11.6 million in 2001 (nearly a quarter of program spending on antihypertensive drugs) and overall would have been more clinically appropriate. Replacement of calcium channel blockers resulted in the greatest potential savings. Using price caps similar to those in the Medicaid program would have resulted in an even larger potential savings of $20.5 million (42% of the program cost). Conclusions Adherence to evidence-based hypertension prescribing guidelines could result in significant prescription cost savings for elderly patients with hypertension, resulting in savings of approximately US$1.2 billion nationally. Identifying similar areas where prescribing can be improved will be critical to the affordability of prescription drug benefit programs.",0,0,

593,Educational and organizational interventions to improve depression management in primary care: a systematic review,"CONTEXT: Depression is a common occurrence in primary care but is often overlooked or treated suboptimally. A number of organizational and educational strategies to improve depression management have been proposed. The clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies have not yet been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of organizational and educational interventions to improve depression management in primary care. DATA SOURCES: We searched electronic medical and psychological databases from inception to March 2003 (MEDLINE, PsycLIT, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluations Database, Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group register and Cochrane Effective Professional and Organizational Change Group register)""; Correspondence with authors;"" and reference lists used. The search terms related to depression, primary care, and all policies and organizational and educational interventions. STUDY SELECTION: We selected 36 studies, including 29 randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled clinical trials, 5 before-and-after controlled studies, and 2 interrupted time-series studies. Findings related to the management and outcomes of depression were sought. Data extraction: Methodological details and results were extracted and reviewed by 2 reviewers. The summary relative risks have been calculated using the original data where possible, and an attempt has been made to correct the error of the analysis unit. DATA SYNTHESIS: Narrative synthesis was performed. Twenty-one studies with positive results were found. Strategies to improve patient outcomes have generally been those involving complex interventions involving training of clinicians, an increased role for the nurse (case management by nurses), and a greater degree of integration between primary and secondary care (counseling and liaison). Medication advice over the phone from practice nurses or trained advisors was also effective. Simple guideline implementation and educational strategies were generally ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant potential for improving depression management in primary care. Commonly used guidelines and parenting strategies are likely to be ineffective. Implementing the insights from this research will require significant investment in primary care and a major shift in how care is organized and delivered.",0,0,
594,Educating primary care residents on how to know about and administer hepatitis B vaccination to patients with diabetes mellitus,"OBJECTIVES: Although guidelines recommend hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination for adults with diabetes mellitus (DM), vaccination rates remain low. Our aim was to evaluate knowledge and practice related to HBV and to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted educational program. METHODS: Primary care residents (n = 244) at three academic institutions were interviewed about various aspects of HBV. Residents in an exercise program were then randomly assigned to an educational intervention (E) (n=20) and a control group (C) (n=19). The E-group received a focused didactic lecture and regular email reminders with immediate feedback. We compared knowledge values before and after the intervention. Chart audits were conducted to assess residents' behavior. RESULTS: A total of 103 (42%) residents responded to the survey. The survey revealed that residents lacked the necessary knowledge and skills to assess the risk of HBV in patients with DM. In the controlled study of the e-intervention, both groups had similar baseline knowledge scores. The E group had a significant increase in knowledge scores immediately after the intervention from a mean of 29% at baseline to 70% (P<0.001) that was maintained at 6 months post-intervention (65%; P<0.001). In group C, the values did not differ from baseline at 6 months after the intervention (38% vs. 29%). No significant differences were observed in documentation skills. CONCLUSIONS: A combined educational program was effective in improving knowledge about HBV and vaccination in DM but had limited impact on physician practice. Further studies involving system changes along with educational initiatives are needed to improve clinical practice.",0,1,
595,Educational interventions for general practitioners to identify and treat depression as a risk factor for suicide in young people: a systematic review and meta-analysis protocol,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a major public health problem and the second leading cause of death among young adults worldwide. Globally, there are 164,000 suicides per year among young people under the age of 25. Depression is a strong risk factor for suicide. Evidence shows that 45% of those who commit suicide, including young adults, are more likely to contact their GP than a psychiatrist in the month before they die. Additional evidence suggests that risk factors or early warning signs for suicide in young people go undetected and untreated by GPs. Health-based suicide prevention interventions aimed at general practitioners aim to improve the identification of at-risk young people. The rationale behind this type of intervention is that early identification and improved clinical management of at-risk individuals reduce morbidity and mortality. This systematic review will summarize evidence on the effectiveness of general practitioner education in identifying and treating depression as a suicide risk factor in young people. METHODS/DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Manual for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and follow the reporting guidelines of the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Electronic databases are systematically searched for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies that review the effectiveness of general practitioner interventions in identifying and treating depression as a suicide risk factor in young people compared to any other intervention, no intervention, usual care, or watchful waiting . Gray literature is searched by screening study registers. Only studies published in English are considered. No date restrictions are applied. Two authors will independently review titles and abstracts of potential studies. The primary outcome is the detection and treatment of depression. Secondary endpoints were suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, intentional self-harm, knowledge of suicide risk factors and suicidal behaviors, attitudes about suicidal risk and suicidal behaviors, confidence in dealing with suicidal risk factors and suicidal behaviors. DISCUSSION: Our study will inform the development of future educational interventions and provide proof of concept and acceptability to help primary care physicians identify and manage suicidal behaviors in young people.

596,Educational interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing and dispensing: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics contributes to growing antibiotic resistance, an important public health problem. Strategies need to be developed to improve antibiotic prescribing. Our goal is to review educational programs aimed at improving the prescribing of antibiotics by physicians and/or the dispensing of antibiotics by pharmacists, both in primary care and in hospitals. METHODS: We performed a critical systematic search and review of the relevant literature on educational programs aimed at improving antibiotic prescribing and dispensing practices in primary care and the hospital setting, published from January 2001 to December 2011. RESULTS: We identified 78 Studies for analysis, 47 in primary care and 31 in hospitals. The studies varied greatly in design, but reported mostly positive results. Outcomes measured in the studies reviewed were adherence to guidelines, total number of antibiotics prescribed, or both, attitudes and behaviors related to antibiotic prescribing, and quality of pharmacy practice related to antibiotics. Twenty-nine studies (62%) in the primary care setting and twenty-four (78%) in the hospital setting reported positive results for all measured endpoints,” fourteen studies (30%) in the primary care setting and six (20%) in the hospital setting reported positive results for some endpoints and Outcomes that in others were not statistically influenced by the intervention;"" only four studies in the primary care setting and one study in the hospital setting failed to report significant improvements after the intervention for all outcomes. In 46% and 41% of all studies reviewed, respectively, an improvement in guideline adherence and a decrease in the total number of antibiotics prescribed after educational interventions were observed. Behavioral changes associated with antibiotic prescribing and an improvement in the quality of pharmacy practice were observed in four and one study, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results show that the use of antibiotics could be improved by educational interventions, which are mostly multifaceted interventions.",0,0,
597,Educational visit and hypnosedative prescription in general medicine,"Public concern about the prescribing of hypnosedatives (mainly benzodiazepines) led to a controlled attempt at an educational effort to encourage rational prescribing by General Practitioners (GPs). This paper describes the educational intervention and its process evaluation. In urban and rural New South Wales, 137 GPs were visited during office hours by a GP or pharmacist who had received communication training. Materials offered to GPs included relaxation bands and a brochure with problem-based treatment guidelines. The interview consisted of three phases: establishing a relationship, then educational material was presented, and finally the visitor sought the doctor's consent to screen five patients for long-term benzodiazepines. The visits were well received. Several measures were compiled to reflect physicians' motivation and interest in non-drug management”; There was virtually no correlation between any of these process measurements and the study outcome: a change in prescribing behavior. Self-reported benzodiazepine prescribing grossly underestimated actual self-reported prescribing incidents. We interpret this as a reminder that we don't always do what we want to do, and we don't always do what we think we're doing.",0,0,
598,Effect of a computerized body mass index prompt on the diagnosis and treatment of obesity in adults.,"Background: In overweight adults, physicians often fail to identify and recommend treatments for obesity. We sought to determine whether prompting for a computerized body mass index (BMI) chart would increase the likelihood that primary care physicians would diagnose patients with obesity and refer them for obesity treatment. METHODS: A total of 846 obese patients from 37 general practitioners were randomly assigned to either include a patient's BMI prompt in their electronic medical record (intervention group) or not to include a BMI prompt in their electronic medical record (comparison group). We then examined the patients' medical records for evidence of an obesity diagnosis and referral for specific obesity treatments. We also measured whether the presence of comorbidities in obese patients affects the likelihood of diagnosis and treatment by physicians. Results: Obese patients from physicians who had a BMI prompt in their medical records were significantly more likely to receive an obesity diagnosis than obese patients from physicians who did not receive a BMI prompt (16.6% versus 10.7%""; ""P= .016). Patients from physicians provided with a BMI prompt were more likely to receive referral for diet treatment (14.0% vs. 7.3%, p=0.002) and exercise (12.1%) than patients from Physicians who were not prompted for a spreadsheet. versus 7.1%, P=0.016). Of the obesity comorbidities, only obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was a predictor of a patient being diagnosed with obesity (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.281, 0.869, P=0.014). Conclusions: The inclusion of a computerized BMI prompt increased the likelihood that physicians would diagnose obesity in obese patients and refer them for treatment.",0,1,
599,Effect of minimal pharmacy intervention on improving adherence to asthma guidelines.,"Aim To investigate the effectiveness of a minimal intervention strategy to improve adherence to pediatric asthma guidelines. Design and setting A group of pharmacists were encouraged to discuss key elements of asthma management with the GPs they normally work with. Adherence to the guidelines was assessed by studying prescriptions for children with asthma. We compared the treatment of children registered in pharmacies that participated in the study (intervention group) with a control group of children registered in other non-participating pharmacies (reference group) and with the results of a previous study. Main outcome measures The number of children who received no short-acting betamimetics, no inhaled corticosteroids during treatment with long-acting betamimetics, and more than one inhaler type. Results The number of children not receiving short-acting betamimetics was significantly lower in the intervention group (176/1447 vs. 534/3527; p<0.01) and fewer children were not receiving inhaled corticosteroids despite receiving long-acting betamimetics (6/ 219 vs 41/477; p=0.03). p<0.01).

602,Effect of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship intervention on general practitioner prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics: a randomized trial.,"Importance Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been effective for inpatients, often through the prescription of audits and feedback. However, most antibiotics are used in outpatients with acute respiratory infections (ARTIs). Aim To evaluate the effect of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing for outpatient pediatric patients. Design Cluster-randomized study of outpatient antimicrobial use comparing prescribing between intervention and control practices using a shared electronic health record. After excluding children with chronic diseases, antibiotic allergies, and prior antibiotic use, we estimated prescription rates for targeted ARTIs, standardized by age, sex, race, and insurance, from 20 months before the procedure to 12 months after (October 2008–June 2011). ). Setting and Participants A network of 25 pediatric primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey; 18 practices (162 clinicians) participated and provided feedback on prescribing bacterial and viral ARTIs or usual practice Rates of prescribing broad spectrum antibiotics (outside of guidelines) for bacterial ARTIs and antibiotics for viral ARTIs at 1 year post-procedure Results Prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics from 26.8% to 14.3% (absolute difference, 12.5%) in intervention practices compared to 28.4% to 22.6% (absolute difference, 5.8%) in controls (difference of differences [DOD], 6.7%; P=0.01 for differences).

604,Impact of peer-reviewed audit and feedback on primary care physician prescribing and trial ordering performance: a cluster-randomized controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Much of the world's research focuses on cost containment and better compliance in healthcare. Research that focuses on professional behavior is often conducted in a well-controlled research environment. In this study, a large-scale implementation of a peer review strategy in terms of both trial ordering and prescribing behavior in primary care was tested as part of normal quality improvement. Methods: We planned a cluster RCT in existing local quality improvement collaborations (LQICs) in primary care. The study ran from January 2008 to January 2011. LQICs were randomly assigned to one of two study arms, with each arm receiving the same intervention of audit and feedback combined with peer review. Both arms were offered five different clinical themes and acted as blind controls for the other arm. The differences in trial order rates and prescription rates between both arms were analyzed in an intention-to-treat pre-post analysis and a per-protocol analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one LQIC groups, including 197 general practitioners working in 88 practices, participated in the study. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in changes in test design or prescribing performance between intervention and control groups. The per-protocol analysis showed positive results for half of the clinical subjects. The increase in total tests ordered was 3% in the intervention arm and 15% in the control arm. At prescription, the increase in prescriptions was 20% in the intervention arm and 66% in the control arm. It was observed that the groups with the highest order and prescription volumes at baseline showed the greatest improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the results of previous work could not be confirmed by our attempt to implement the strategy in the field. We did not see a decrease in test quantities ordered or medications prescribed, but rather a smaller increase. The implementation of peer review with audit and feedback has not proven feasible in primary care in the Netherlands.

605,Impact of audit and feedback and reminder messages on referrals to primary care in radiology: a randomized study.,"Background Radiological tests are commonly used by general practitioners (GPs). These tests can be overused and contribute little to clinical management. Our aim was to evaluate two methods for reducing GP requests for radiological testing according to the UK Royal College of Radiologists guidelines on lumbar spine and knee radiographs. Methods We assessed audit and feedback and educational reminder messages in six radiology departments and 244 general practices they served. The study was a pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled before-after study with a 2 x 2 factorial design. A randomly selected subset of medical records from primary care physicians was reviewed for compliance with the guidelines. The main outcome measure was the number of X-ray requests per 1000 patients per year. The analysis was intended to treat. Results The effect of educational reminder messages (ie change in request rate after intervention) was an absolute change of -1·53 (95% CI -2·5 to -0·57) for the lumbar spine and of -1·61 (-2 ·6 to -0·62) for knee radiographs, both relative reductions of about 20%. The effect of audit and feedback was an absolute change of -0·07 (-1·3 to 0·9) for lumbar spine from 0·04 (-0·95 to 1·03) for knee radiographs, both relative reductions of about 1%. The agreement between the groups did not differ significantly. Interpretation Biannual feedback of audit data is ineffective, but routinely attaching educational reminder messages to X-rays is effective and does not affect the quality of referrals. Any radiology department processing referrals from primary care could perform this intervention to good effect.",1,1,
606,Impact of behavior change on outcome in early-to-moderate-stage chronic kidney disease: A cluster-randomized study,"OBJECTIVES: Due to recent changes in our understanding of the underlying cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the importance of lifestyle modification in preventing the progression of renal dysfunction and complications has become apparent. Additionally, effective collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and nephrologists is essential to ensure a better delivery system for CKD treatment. In this cluster-randomized study, we examined the effect of behavioral modification on the outcome of early-to-moderate-stage CKD. DESIGN: Stratified open cluster randomized study. SETTING: A total of 489 general practitioners belonging to 49 local medical associations (clusters) in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,379 patients (1,195 in group A (standard intervention) and 1,184 in group B (advanced intervention)) between the ages of 40 and 74 years suffering from CKD who were consulted by primary care physicians. INTERVENTION: All patients were treated according to current CKD guidelines. Group B clusters received three additional interventions: patients received both an educational lifestyle change intervention and a CKD status letter to prevent them from stopping treatment, and Group B primary care physicians received data sheets to help reduce the to ease the gap between goal and practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome measures were 1) the rate of noncompliance in accepting ongoing medical follow-up by patients, 2) the rate of cooperation between primary care physicians and nephrologists, and 3) progression of CKD. RESULTS: The rate of discontinuous doctor visits was significantly lower in group B (16.2% in group A vs. 11.5% in group B, p=0.01). Significantly higher referral and co-treatment rates were observed in group B (p<0.01). The mean eGFR deterioration rate tended to be lower in Group B (Group A: 2.6+/-5.8 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, Group B: 2.4+/-5.1 mL/min /1.73 m2/year, p = 0.07 ). A significant difference in eGFR deterioration rate was observed in patients with stage 3 CKD (Group A: 2.4 +/- 5.9 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, Group B: 1.9 +/- 4.4 mL/min/1.73 m2/year, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Our care system achieved behavioral change in CKD patients, namely significantly fewer discontinuous clinical visits, and behavioral change in both primary care physicians and nephrologists, namely significantly higher referral and co-treatment rates, resulting in a delay in CKD progression, particularly in Patients with Stage 3 proteinuric CKD.

607,Effect of behavioral interventions on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in general practice: A randomized clinical trial,"IMPORTANT: Behavioral science-based interventions could reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of behavioral interventions and the incidence of inappropriate (non-guideline compliant) antibiotic prescriptions during outpatient visits for acute respiratory infections. DESIGN, SETUP, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster-randomized clinical study conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled physicians randomized to receive 0, 1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received training on antibiotic prescribing guidelines at enrollment. Interventions began between November 1, 2011 and October 1, 2012. Follow-up for the last starting sites ended April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, performed individually or in combination: proposed alternatives presented e-prescription records proposing non-antibiotic treatments; a reasonable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for antibiotic prescriptions in electronic medical records;"" peer comparison emailed clinicians who compared their antibiotic prescription rates with those of ""top performers"" (those with the lowest inappropriate prescription rates) compared. KEY RESULTS AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months before the intervention to 18 months after, adjusting the impact of each intervention for concomitant interventions, and trends of the intervention, with random effects for practices and clinicians. RESULTS: There were 14,753 visits (mean patient age 47 years; 69% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory infections during the baseline period and 16,959 visits (mean patient age 48 years; 67% women) during the intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescription rates decreased from 24.1% at baseline to 13.1% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, -11.0%) for control practices and from 22.1% to 6.1% (absolute difference, -16.0%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, -5.0% [95% CI, -7.8% to 0.1%]; P=0.66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2% to 5.2% (absolute difference, -18.1%) for reasonable justification (difference in differences, -7.0% [95% CI, -9.1% to -2.9%] , P<0.001) and from 19.9% to 3.7% (absolute difference, -16.3%) for peer comparison (difference of differences, -5.2% [95% CI, -6.9% to -1.6%]; ""P<0.001). There were no statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between the interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among primary care practices, the use of reasonable justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections.

608,Impact of clinical decision support systems: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing emphasis on the role of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in improving care and reducing costs, evidence of widespread use is lacking. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, healthcare processes, workload and efficiency, patient satisfaction, Cost and use and implementation of the provider. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science up to January 2011. STUDY SELECTION: Investigators independently reviewed reports to identify randomized studies published in English on electronic CDSSs implemented in clinical settings""; used by providers to determine the to support decision-making at the point of care;and reported clinical, medical care process, workload, relationship-centric, economic, or provider utilization outcomes.DATA EXTRACTION:Researchers extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and quality.DATA SYNTHESIS: 148 randomized controlled trials were included.A total of 1 assessed 28 (86%) health care process interventions, 29 (20%) assessed clinical outcomes, and 22 (15%) measured costs.Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs improved health care interventions process related to the implementation of preventive services (n = 25; odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.58]), ordering clinical trials (n = 20; OR, 1.72).

Conclusion: Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs are effective in improving health care process interventions in various settings, but evidence for clinical, economic, workload, and efficiency outcomes remains sparse. The review expands knowledge in this area by highlighting the benefits of CDSSs demonstrated outside of experienced academic centers.",0,1,
609,Impact of the computer-aided implementation of the European best practice guideline on adherence and goal achievement: ORAMA results.,"Background: The success of guidelines largely depends on their effective implementation and acceptance in clinical practice. The Optimal Renal Anemia Management Assessment (ORAMA) study evaluated the impact of the European Best Practice Guideline (EBPG) prompt on patient outcomes. METHODS: ORAMA was a prospective, international, multicenter, cluster-randomized study. 53 centers in eight European countries enrolled patients with stage V chronic kidney disease who were on chronic dialysis. Patients were either anemic (hemoglobin [Hb] < 11 g/dL [110 g/L]) or were being treated with agents to stimulate erythropoiesis and/or iron supplementation. The centers were randomized into two groups, with or without access to a Computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. In a post-hoc analysis, patients were further subdivided into adherence or non-compliance by investigators to the EBPG, regardless of use of CDS. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with Hb > 11 g/dL (110 g/L), reflecting the hematological targets in the revised EPBG. Results: In this population of 599 dialysis patients, the hematological goals did not differ in the presence or absence of a CDS system. There was a general shift towards improved patient distribution by Hb category, while the width of the distribution curves remained unchanged. The proportion of patients with Hb > 11 g/dl (110 g/l) was higher among adherents (79% and 84% with and without CDS use, respectively) than among non-adherents (59% and 57%, respectively) ). Conclusions: ORAMA is the first international study to show that adherence to EBPG improves the achievement of anemia indices. The availability of a CDS system had no impact on anemia management.",0,1,
610,"Effect of computer-assisted, evidence-based guidelines for the management of asthma and angina in adults in primary care: cluster-randomized controlled study.","Brief Description Aim: To evaluate the use of a computerized decision-making support system to implement evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of adult asthma and angina in primary care. Design: A randomized, controlled, before-and-after, pragmatic cluster study using a two by two incomplete block design. Setting: 60 GP practices in the North East of England. Participants: GPs and practice nurses in the study practices and their patients aged 18 and over with angina pectoris or asthma. Main outcome measures: Adherence to guidelines based on review of case notes and patient-reported overall and condition-specific outcome measures. Results: The computer-based decision support system had no significant impact on consultation rates, the process of care interventions (including prescribing), or patient-reported outcomes for either condition. Software usage was low. Conclusions: No effect of computerized, evidence-based guidelines on the management of asthma or angina in adults in primary care was found. This was probably due to the low usage of the software, although the system was optimized as much as technically possible. Even when the technical issues involved in manufacturing a system that fully supports the management of chronic diseases have been solved, the challenge remains to integrate the systems into clinical encounters where busy physicians treat patients with complex, multiple conditions.",0,1,

612,Effect of exercise recommendation programs in primary care on physical activity and improvement in health outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of exercise recommendation programs on physical activity and health outcomes. Design systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and ongoing trial registries up to October 2009. We also checked trial references. Study selection Design: randomized controlled trials or non-randomized controlled trials (cluster or single) published in peer-reviewed journals. POPULATION sedentary people with or without medical diagnosis. Exercise referral programs are defined as: clear referrals from healthcare professionals to outside service providers to increase physical activity or exercise, physical activity or exercise programs tailored to individuals, and initial assessment and monitoring throughout programs. Comparators: usual care, no intervention or alternative exercise recommendations. RESULTS Eight randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria and compared exercise recommendation regimens with usual care (six trials), alternative physical activity interventions (two), and an exercise recommendation regimen plus a self-determination theory intervention (one). Compared to usual care, follow-up data for exercise programs showed an increased number of participants achieving 90-150 minutes of physical activity of at least moderate intensity per week (pooled relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1, 30) and a reduced level of depression (pooled standardized mean difference -0.82, -1.28 to -0.35). Evidence of a difference between groups in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity or other health outcomes was conflicting at follow-up. We found no difference in outcomes between exercise referral programs and the other two comparison groups. None of the included studies separately reported results in people with specific medical diagnoses. Significant heterogeneity in the quality and nature of exercise recommendation schemes between studies may have contributed to the inconsistency of outcome findings. Conclusions There remains considerable uncertainty as to the effectiveness of exercise recommendation programs on increasing physical activity, fitness or health indicators, or whether they represent an efficient use of resources for sedentary people with or without a medical diagnosis.",0,0,

Depression is also a risk factor for poor health outcomes in arthritis sufferers. Aim To determine whether improving treatment for depression improves pain and functional outcomes in older adults with depression and arthritis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Preplanned subgroup analyzes of Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment (IMPACT), a randomized controlled trial of 1801 depressed older adults (age 60 years) conducted in 18 primary care clinics of 8 health facilities from July 1999 to August 2001 to nursing organizations in 5 states of the United States. A total of 1001 (56%) reported co-existing arthritis at baseline. Intervention Antidepressants and/or 6 to 8 sessions of psychotherapy (problem solving treatment in primary care). Major outcome measures Depression, pain intensity (0 to 10 scale), impairment of daily activities due to arthritis (0 to 10 scale), general health status, and overall quality of life assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.

617,Effect of integrated care for chronic low back pain patients on sick leave: economic assessment alongside a randomized controlled trial,"AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and value for money of an integrated care program compared to usual care for on-call chronic low back pain patients. DESIGN: Economic assessment alongside a randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals) in the Netherlands, 2005-9. PARTICIPANTS: 134 adults aged 18-65 years on call-off with chronic low back pain: 66 were randomized to integrated care and 68 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Integrated care consisted of a participatory ergonomics-based workplace intervention involving a supervisor and a graded activity program based on cognitive behavioral principles. The usual care was provided by general practitioners and occupational physicians according to Dutch guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was time to sustained return to work. The secondary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) measured with EuroQol. RESULTS: Total costs in the integrated care group (13,165 pounds, SD 13,600 pounds) were significantly lower than in the usual care group (18,475 pounds, SD 13,616 pounds). Cost-effectiveness levels and acceptance curves showed that integrated care was cost-effective compared to usual care for return to work and QALYs gained. The cost-benefit analyzes showed that every Euro1 invested in integrated care would yield an estimated Euro26. The net societal benefit of integrated care compared to usual care was £5744. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an integrated care program for sick patients with chronic low back pain has great potential to significantly reduce societal costs, increase care effectiveness, improve quality of life, and improve functioning across the board.

619,"Effect of an intervention aimed at increasing physical activity, reducing physical inactivity, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children: Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5), school-based, cluster-based, randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of a school-based intervention in increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behavior, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in children. DESIGN cluster randomized controlled trial. RECRUITMENT 60 primary schools in South West England. PARTICIPANTS Elementary school children in 4th grade (age 8-9 years) at recruitment and baseline assessment, in 5th grade during intervention, and at the end of 5th grade (age 9-10) at follow-up assessment. INTERVENTION The Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) intervention consisted of teacher training, interactive classroom and child-parent homework schedules, all materials needed for classroom and homework, and written materials for school newspapers and parents. The intervention was conducted when the children were in their 5th grade (age 9-10 years). Schools allocated to the control received standard instruction. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES The pre-specified primary endpoints were accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, accelerometer-measured minutes of sedentary behavior per day, and reported daily servings of fruit and vegetables. RESULTS 60 schools with more than 2221 children were recruited"";"" For the main analyses, valid data were available for fruit and vegetable consumption for 2121 children, for accelerometer physical activity and physical inactivity for 1252 children, and for secondary endpoints for 1825 to 2212 children. None of the three primary endpoints differed between children in schools assigned to the AFLY5 intervention and those assigned to the control group. The mean difference between the intervention group and the control group was -1.35 (95% confidence interval -5.29 to 2.59) minutes per day for moderate to vigorous physical activity, -0.11 (-9.71 to 9.49) minutes per day for sedentary behavior, and 0.08 (-0.12 to 0.28) servings per day for fruit and vegetable consumption. The intervention was effective on three of nine secondary endpoints after multiple tests were considered: self-reported time spent with screens at weekends (-21 (-37 to -4) minutes per day), self-reported portions of snacks per day (- 0.22 (-0.38 to -0.05)) and portions of high-energy drinks per day (-0.26 (-0.43 to -0.10)) were all reduced. Results from a series of sensitivity analyzes testing different assumptions about missing data and from per-protocol analyzes yielded similar results. CONCLUSION The results suggest that the school-based AFLY5 intervention is not effective in increasing physical activity levels, reducing physical inactivity, and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in elementary school children. Changing these activities may require more intensive behavioral interventions in children or upstream interventions at the family, community, and school settings. These findings are relevant to researchers, policy makers, public health practitioners and physicians involved in health promotion, policy making and service procurement.

DESIGN Parallel group, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING National Quitline, England. PARTICIPANTS 2,591 non-pregnant smokers aged 16 and over residing in England who called the quitline between February 2009 and February 2010 and agreed to set a quit date: 648 were each randomized to standard support, proactive support, or proactive support with nicotine replacement therapy, and 647 were randomized to standard support with nicotine replacement therapy. INTERVENTIONS In addition to standard support, two interventions were offered: six weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy and proactive counseling sessions (repeated phone calls from and interaction with cessation counselors). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was self-reported smoking cessation for six or more months after the smoking cessation date. The secondary outcome was termination, validated by exhaled carbon monoxide measured at six or more months. RESULTS At six months, 17.7% (n=229) of those offered nicotine replacement therapy reported quitting compared to 20.1% (n=261) who were not offered such therapy (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.04) and 18.2% (n = 236) of the proactive counseling provided reported quitting smoking compared to 19.6% (n = 254) of the offered standard support (0.91, 0.75 to 1.11). Data validated by carbon monoxide measurements altered outcomes only for nicotine replacement therapy, with smoking cessation validated in 6.6% (85/1295) of those offered nicotine replacement therapy compared to 9.4% (122/ 1296) who were not offered such therapy (0.67, 0.50 to 0.90).

621,Impact of Patient-Specific Assessments Compared to Traditional Guidelines on Assessment Decisions in Angina: Adequacy of Referral and Assessment in Angina (ARIA) Trial,"BACKGROUND: Traditional guidelines have had limited impact on how physicians change test designs. We sought to determine the effect of patient-specific assessments versus conventional guidelines on appropriate assessment of angina. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of 145 physicians who received patient-specific ratings (online prompt as to whether the specific vignette was considered appropriate or inappropriate for the study, with access to detailed information on how the ratings were derived) and 147 physicians who conventional guidelines were received from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology. Physicians provided recommendations for 12 web-based patient vignettes before and 12 after these procedures. The result was the proportion of reasonable investigative decisions as defined by 2 independent expert panels. RESULTS: Decisions to perform stress electrocardiography were more appropriate with patient-specific ratings (819/1491 [55%]) compared to conventional guidelines (648/1488 [44%]) (odds ratio [OR], 1.57"", 95% Confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.82) The effect was stronger for angiography (1274/1595 [80%] with patient-specific assessments compared to 1009/1576 [64%] with conventional guidelines [OR, 2.24 ; 95% CI, 1.90-2.62]).3.22) and for angiography (80% vs. 65%; OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.79-2.47). These effects were robust to physician specialty (cardiologists and general practitioners) and vignette characteristics, including older age, female gender, and nonwhite/racial origin.CONCLUSION: Patient-specific ratings, in contrast to traditional guidelines, have changed physician testing behavior and have the potential to bias to reduce in practice and the reasonable use z of investigations to increase.",1,1,
622,Effect of physician recommendation and patient adherence on colorectal cancer testing rates.,"This study examined: (1) patient characteristics associated with physician recommendation for colorectal cancer screening (CRC) and patient compliance, and (2) the combined effect of recommendation and adherence to CRC testing, broadly defined. Data are from the 1999 MA BRFSS and a recall survey of 869 BRFSS participants aged 50 years and older. Logistic regression was used to identify correlates of recommendation, compliance, and assessment. Patient-physician factors were positively associated with referral, adherence, and testing. Inadequate health insurance was negatively associated with recommendation (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.27-0.78) and testing (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.38-1.1). Men were no more recommended (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.78-1.5) but were more likely to adhere (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2-2.0) and could be tested (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-1.9).

PATIENTS: Five hundred eighty-four patients (aged 21-85 years) with uncontrolled primary hypertension; 296 were in the intervention group and 288 were in the control group. Intervention group MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Social support and self-efficacy questionnaires were administered at baseline and at the end of the study. In the control group (p=0.0053), but not in the intervention group, however, was baseline adherence was high in both groups. There were small but significant improvements in self-efficacy (p<0.04) and social support (p<0.05) scores in the intervention group but not in the control group at the end of the Social study Support and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy improved as a function of study duration p articulation (9-month vs. 6-month intervention), regardless of whether the patient received the intervention. Blood pressure control in both groups improved significantly at the end of the study; however, mean blood pressure was significantly lower in the intervention group (129.7/76.6 mmHg) compared to the control group (140.8/78.9 mmHg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.032 for diastolic) . CONCLUSION: Social support and self-efficacy improved significantly in the intervention group at the end of the pharmacist intervention Medication adherence was correlated with self-efficacy, although medication adherence did not improve significantly in the intervention group The fact that social support and self-efficacy improved as a function duration of study participation suggests that participation in a research study may have had a positive impact on these measures. Although changes in social support, self-efficacy, and medication adherence were modest, there was significantly better blood pressure control in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings suggest that changes in medication adherence, self-efficacy, or social support probably played a minor role Bl pressure results in these studies.",0,0,
624,Effect of telecare management on pain and depression in cancer patients: a randomized study,"Context Pain and depression are two of the most common and treatable symptoms of cancer, but they often go undiagnosed, undertreated, or both. Aim To determine whether centralized telephone care management coupled with automated symptom monitoring can improve depression and pain in cancer patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Randomized controlled trial conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural oncology practices participating in the Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) study. Recruitment took place from March 2006 to August 2008 and the follow-up was completed in August 2009. Participating patients had depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9, score 10), cancer-related pain (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI] worst pain score ¡Ã 6), or both. Intervention The 202 patients randomly assigned to intervention and 203 to usual care were stratified by symptom type. Patients in the intervention group received centralized telecare management by a specialist team of nurses and physicians coupled with automated symptom monitoring at home through interactive voice recording or the Internet. Main outcome measures Blinded assessment at baseline and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months for depression (20-item Hopkins symptom checklist [HSCL-20]) and pain severity (BPI). Results Of the 405 study participants, 131 had depression only, 96 had pain only, and 178 had both depression and pain. Of the 274 pain patients, 137 patients in the intervention group showed greater improvements in BPI pain severity over the 12 months of the study, whether measured as a continuous severity score or as a categorical pain responder (30% decrease in BPI). than the 137 patients in the usual care group (p<0.001 for both). Similarly, of the 309 patients with depression, the 154 patients in the intervention group showed greater improvements in HSCL-20 depression severity scores over the 12 months of the study, whether measured as a continuous severity score or as a categorical depression responder (¡Ã 50% decrease in HSCL) than the 155 patients in the usual care group (p<0.001 for both). The standardized effect sizes for between-group differences at 3 and 12 months were 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-1.02) and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.01-0.77) for pain and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.16-0.69) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.08-0.72) for depression. Conclusion Centralized telecare management coupled with automated symptom monitoring resulted in improved pain and depression outcomes in cancer patients treated at geographically distributed urban and rural oncology practices.",0,0,

626,Effect of telephone contact on further suicide attempts in patients discharged from an emergency department: randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To determine the impact over one year of telephone contact with patients one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for intentional self-poisoning compared to usual care. DESIGN Multicenter, randomized controlled trial. SETTING 13 Emergency departments in northern France. PARTICIPANTS 605 people discharged from an emergency room after attempting suicide by intentional self-poisoning. INTERVENTION The intervention consisted of contacting patients by telephone one month or three months after discharge from an emergency department for attempted suicide to assess the success of recommended treatment or to adjust treatment. The control patients were treated as usual, in most cases they were referred back to their general practitioner. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome measures were the proportion of participants who attempted suicide again, the number of deaths from suicide, and the losses at 13 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints were type and number of contacts with health care. RESULTS Based on intention to treat, the three groups did not differ significantly in terms of further suicide attempts, deaths from suicide, or loss of follow-up: contact at one month (intervention 23% (34/147) vs. controls 30% (93/312), Difference 7%, 95% confidence interval -2% to 15%), three months (25% (36/146) vs. 30%, difference 5%, -4% to 14%). Participants who were contacted after one month were less likely to report having attempted suicide again at follow-up (12% vs. 22% in the control group, difference 10%, 2% vs. 18%). CONCLUSION Contacting individuals by telephone one month after discharge from an emergency room for intentional self-poisoning may help reduce the number of repeat suicide attempts over a year.",0,0,
627,Effect of training on acceptance of nutrition-related cancer prevention activities by primary care practices: results from a randomized controlled trial,"AIM: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed a handbook to guide primary care practices in structuring their office environment and routine visits to improve nutritional screening, counseling/referral, and follow-up for cancer prevention. Acceptance of the handbook's recommendations by primary care practices was assessed by examining two strategies: training physicians to implement the handbook's recommendations versus simply mailing the handbook. This article reports the results of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of these two strategies. DESIGN: A three-arm, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Freestanding primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. INTERVENTION: Each study practice was randomly assigned to one of three groups. The training group practices were invited to send a member from their practice of choice to a 3-hour “train-a-trainer” workshop, the purely manual group practices received the nutrition manual in the mail, and the control group practices received no intervention. Training was provided for training group practices in the four main components of the Nutrition Handbook: how to organize the office environment to support nutrition-related cancer prevention activities; how to verify patient compliance with NCI dietary guidelines; how to provide dietary advice/referral;"" and how to implement a patient follow-up system to support patients to make changes in their diet-related behaviors. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcomes of the study were derived from two assessment tools. The observational tool documented the tools and procedures recommended by the nutritional manual, which were adopted in patient records and in the practice environment.The face-to-face structured interview assessed the physician's and staff's self-reported nutritional-related activities that reflected the recommendations of the nutritional manual.Data from these two instruments were used to four to generate adherence scores corresponding to the domains: practice organization, nutritional screening, nutritional counseling/referral, and patient follow-up MAIN RESULTS: Adoption of the manual's recommendations was high among practices in the training group on highest, which is reflected in their higher adherence scores. They organized their practice (P = 0.005) and assessed their patients' eating habits (P = 0.046) significantly more closely to the recommendations of the nutrition manual than practices in the manual-only group. Despite the highest level of compliance, however, only 54.9% of the training group practices adhered to the recommendations of the nutritional counseling/referral manual and 28.5% to the recommendations for office organization, 23.5% to the recommendations for nutritional screening and 14, 6% adhered to recommendations for patient follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: GP practices exposed to the nutritional manual in a training session adopted more of the manual's recommendations. In particular, practices that were invited to training sessions were more likely to conduct nutritional screening and design their office environment to be conducive to nutritional services for cancer prevention. The effects of exercise were moderate and not statistically significant for dietary counseling/referral or patient follow-up, which are important to achieve long-term dietary changes in patients. The overall low scores for adherence to diet-related activities indicate that there is much room for improvement in practices in the training group.",0,0,

629,Effect of written and computer-based decision aids for the US Agency for Health Care Policy and Research's depression guidelines on the assessment of hypothetical clinical scenarios.,"Goal. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of written and computer-aided decision aids (DSAs) based on the United States Health Policy and Research Agency's depression guidelines. methods. Fifty-six internists were randomized to assess clinical scenarios with either a written or a computerized DSA after the initial assessment of scenarios without a DSA. The paired difference between supported and unsupported outcomes was determined for diagnostic accuracy, treatment choice, severity and subtype classification, antipsychotic use, and mental health counseling DSA decreased from 67% to 64% (p=0.0065). Residents who used the computerized DSA (vs. no DSA) requested fewer consultations (65% vs. 52%, P=0.028). In the post hoc analysis, written DSA increased sensitivity (66% to 89%, p<0.001) and computerized DSA improved specificity (66% to 86%, p=0.0020) but decreased sensitivity ( 67% to 49%, p=0.011). Conclusions. Written DSA improved diagnostic accuracy, while computerized DSA did not. However, computerized DSA improved specificity and reduced mental health consultations.",0,1,
630,"Effect on birth outcomes of a formalized treatment approach in hospital labor assessment units: international, randomized controlled trial","OBJECTIVE To determine whether complex nursing and midwifery intervention in hospital units to assess labor activity would increase the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery and improve other maternal and neonatal outcomes. DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with prognostic stratification by hospital. SETTING 20 North American and UK Hospitals. PARTICIPANTS 5002 nulliparous women who were in labor but not in active labor; 2501 were allocated to structured care and 2501 to usual care following a formalized approach to assessment of and interventions for maternal emotional status, pain and fetal position.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was spontaneous vaginal delivery Nursing and indicators of maternal and fetal health during hospitalization and 6-8 weeks after discharge RESULTS Outcome data were collected from 4996 women. The spontaneous vaginal birth rate was 64.0% (n=1597) in the structured care group and 61.3% (n=1533) in the usual care group (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.27) Fewer women assigned to structured care (n=403, 19.5%) rated helpfulness of staff rated less than very helpful those assigned to usual care (n=544, 26.4 %); Odds ratio 0.67, 98.75% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.85. Fewer women assigned to structured care (n=233, 11.3%) were disappointed with staff attention than women assigned to usual care (n=407, 19.7%); Odds ratio 0.51, 98.75% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.70. None of the other results met the specified level of statistical significance. CONCLUSION A structured treatment approach in hospital departments to assess labor activity increased satisfaction with care and pointed to a slight increase in the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery.

632,Effective weight management practice: a review of the evidence for lifestyle interventions,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the existence of obesity management guidelines, uncertainty remains as to which interventions comprise effective practice. This uncertainty could pose an obstacle for busy health professionals who may lack the time and expertise to fully assess the vast body of literature published each year on obesity management. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the available evidence, identify the most effective and promising adult obesity management practices using an established methodology, and present this information according to its quality. ACQUIRING EVIDENCE: This summary review was conducted as of January 2009. A detailed search of relevant databases was conducted up to September 2010. The most effective and promising practices were defined using the Canadian Best Practice Initiative methodology background paper with systematic reviews (with/without meta-analysis) as the most rigorous methodology for developing recommendations deemed most effective (Tier 1), and non-systematic reviews for the development of recommendations deemed most promising (Tier 2). The literature was reviewed and classified across these two levels of accuracy and supplemented with primary studies to further refine the recommendations. RESULTS: Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses was grouped into three intervention themes, or contextual areas, into which more specific, most effective, and/or most promising practice recommendations could be embedded. These intervention topics were (1) targeted multicomponent weight control interventions, (2) diet manipulation strategies, and (3) delivery of weight control interventions, including the roles of health professionals and the method of delivery. Specific recommendations accompanied each topic. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the value of multi-component interventions that are delivered over time and strengthens the role of healthcare professionals. Findings will help inform evidence-based practice for healthcare professionals working in obesity management and prevention.",0,0,
633,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular disease prevention in whole populations: model study,"OBJECTIVE To assess the potential cost-effectiveness of a population-wide risk factor reduction program for cardiovascular disease prevention. DESIGN Economic model analysis. SETTING England and Wales. Population Total population. Model Spreadsheet model to quantify cardiovascular disease reduction over a decade, assuming benefits are consistent for males and females across age and risk groups. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Prevented cardiovascular events, gained quality-adjusted life-years, and saved healthcare costs for a given efficacy”; Estimates of how much it would be worth spending to get a specific outcome. RESULTS A program for the entire population of England and Wales (approximately 50 million people) that reduced cardiovascular events by just 1% would result in healthcare savings of at least £30m ($34m; $48m). $) per year compared to no additional intervention. A 5% reduction in the population's average level of cholesterol or blood pressure (as already achieved through similar measures in some other countries) would result in annual savings of at least £80-100m. Legislation or other action to reduce dietary salt intake by 3g/day (current average intake is around 8.5g/day) would prevent around 30,000 cardiovascular events, with savings of at least £40m per year. Legislation to reduce industrial trans fat intake by around 0.5% of total energy could increase life by around 570,000 years and save NHS at least £230m a year. CONCLUSIONS Any intervention that produces even a modest population-wide reduction in a major cardiovascular risk factor would result in a net cost saving to the NHS and an improvement in health. Given the conservative assumptions used in this model, the true benefit would likely be greater.",0,0,
634,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an exposure-based return-to-work program for patients on sick leave due to common mental disorders: design of a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: To reduce the duration of sick leave and lost productivity due to common mental disorders (CMDs), we developed a return to work program administered by occupational health practitioners (OPs) based on the principles of in vivo exposure (RTW-E program ). This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this program by comparing it to care as usual (CAU). The three research questions we have are: 1) Is a RTW-E program more effective in reducing sick leave among employees with common mental disorders compared to usual care? 2) Is an RTW-E program more effective in reducing sick leave for employees with anxiety disorders compared to employees with other common mental disorders? 3) Is a RTW-E program cost-effective from a societal perspective compared to usual care? METHODS/DESIGN: This study was designed as a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial with a one-year follow-up and randomization at the operating room level. We aimed for 60 surgeries to enroll 200 patients. Patients in the intervention group received the RTW-E program. Patients in the control group were treated as usual. Eligible patients were on sick leave for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of eight weeks due to common mental disorders. As primary outcome measures, we calculated time to full return to work and sick leave duration. Secondary endpoints were time to partial return to work, sick leave prevalence rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of follow-up, and multiple symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and exhaustion; ability to work ; perceived working conditions; self-efficacy for returning to work; coping behavior; avoidance behavior; patient satisfaction;"" and work adjustments. As process measures, we used indices of adherence to the intervention in the intervention group and employee-supervisor communication in both groups. The economic costs were calculated from a societal perspective. The total costs consisted of the costs of utilization of healthcare services, costs of lost production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity, and patient travel expenses to their operating room DISCUSSION: Results will be published in 2009.

635,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of knowledge transfer and behavior change interventions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus - the INDICA study: a randomized controlled cluster study,"Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease whose health outcomes depend on patient and healthcare professional decision making. The Canary Islands Diabetes Intervention Study (INDICA study) aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of educational interventions supported by new technological decision-making aids for type 2 diabetes patients and healthcare professionals in the Canary Islands. Methods/Design The INDICA study is an open-label, community-based, multi-center, clinically controlled, randomized cluster assignment to one of three interventions or usual care. The setting is primary care, in which physicians and nurses can participate. Patients with diabetes diagnosis, 18 ¨C65 years old and regular mobile phone users were randomly selected. Patients with severe comorbidities were excluded. The clusters are primary health care practices with enough professionals and available space to deliver the intervention. The calculated sample size was 2,300 patients. Patients in Group 1 receive an eight-session educational group program every 3 months, led by registered nurses and monitored using protocols and a web-based platform and customized semi-automated SMS for ongoing support. Primary care professionals in Group 2 receive a brief diabetes knowledge update program that includes a decision support tool embedded in the electronic health record and a monthly feedback report on patient outcomes. Group 3 receives a combination of patient and professional interventions. The primary endpoint is the change in HbA1c at 2 years. Secondary endpoints are cardiovascular risk factors, macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, quality of life, psychological outcomes, diabetes awareness, and health care utilization. Data are collected from interviews, questionnaires, clinical examinations and records. Generalized linear mixed models with repeated time measurements are used to analyze changes in outcomes. The cost-effectiveness analysis includes the direct medical costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and two time periods, an intra-study period and a lifetime Markov model, from the health services perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes are planned.

637,Effectiveness of a behavioral intervention in preventing excessive weight gain in infancy (The Baby Milk Trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Childhood is a time of rapid growth and habit formation and may therefore be a critical time for obesity prevention. Excessive weight gain in infancy is linked to later obesity, and formula-fed infants are more likely to gain obesity than breastfed infants. The primary study result is a change in weight standard deviation from birth to 1 year of age. METHODS/DESIGN: We recruited 650 to 700 parents introducing formula within 14 weeks of the birth of their baby for a single (evaluator) blind, individually randomized, controlled, parallel group study. The focus of the intervention is on the caregiver (usually the mother) and the focus of the primary outcome is on the infant. The intervention group receives the behavioral intervention aimed at reducing formula milk intake, promoting appropriate nutrition and healthy weaning, and preventing excessive weight gain in infancy. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and action planning (“implementation intentions”). It has three components: (1) a motivational component to increase parent motivation to follow baby milk feeding guidelines, (2) an action planning component to help turn motivation into action, and (3) a coping planning component to help Helping parents deal with difficult situations. It is delivered by trained facilitators (research nurses) over 6 months through three face-to-face contacts, two phone contacts and written materials. The control group will have an equal number of contacts with facilitators, and general dietary issues will be discussed. Anthropometric outcomes will be measured by trained research personnel, blinded to group assignment, at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months according to standard operating procedures. Validated questionnaires assess milk intake, temperament, appetite, sleep, maternal quality of life, and maternal psychological factors. At 8 months, a 4-day food diary is kept.

638,Efficacy of a combined strategy to improve therapeutic compliance and level of control in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Cholesterol levels remain above guideline values in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. One of the limiting factors in achieving goals in such patients is non-compliance with therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to improve the control of patients with hypercholesterolemia, consisting of a combined strategy that includes the delivery of printed information, control charts for treatment adherence, and the sending of text messages as complementary measures of support of intervention in the general practice. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized, parallel group clinical trial will be conducted in the outpatient family medicine facilities of eight health centers in three of Spain's Autonomous Regions (Comunidades Autonomas) and will include a total of 358 subjects aged 18 and over with a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Patients in the intervention group are provided with printed materials with information about the disease and its management, cell phone text messages with guideline summaries, reminders of upcoming appointments and/or rescheduling for no-shows, and self-report cards to check adherence to recommendations. Both groups – intervention and control – receive routine referrals from their physicians according to current European clinical practice guidelines for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk management. In terms of the measurements to be taken, the key variable is the proportion of subjects achieving target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels over a 24-month follow-up period. The secondary variables are as follows: ""Adherence to lifestyle recommendations and adherence to drug treatment"", variation in lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk levels, occurrence of cardiovascular events, physical activity, food intake, smoking habits, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, health problems ; use of hypolipidemic agents; socio-demographic data; beliefs and expectations regarding preventive recommendations;"" and level of satisfaction with the combined strategy. DISCUSSION: If this intervention proves effective, a recommendation could be made to use this combined strategy in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. It's a simple, relatively inexpensive procedure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02314663.",0,0,
639,Effectiveness of a transfusion monitoring system for self-assessment by a prospective physician.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to search for a more effective transfusion surveillance system than the existing system of retrospective peer review. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study used a study control, preintervention, and postintervention design to evaluate the effectiveness of a physician self-monitoring transfusion monitoring system that operated without the direct involvement of transfusion service physicians. This study also evaluated the effectiveness of issuing a transfusion guideline memo to physicians. Three process indicators were used to assess the physician's behavior at various stages of the blood ordering process: 1) the number of crossmatches ordered per intake, 2) the transfusion-to-crossmatch ratio, and 3) the number of blood units returned to the blood center laboratory after physician self control. The study used two outcome indicators to reflect total blood utilization: 1) the percentage of patients who received RBC transfusions and 2) the number of blood units transfused monthly per recipient. RESULTS: The prospective physician self-monitoring system implemented at the study hospital did not reverse physicians' transfusion decisions, and the process of issuing a memo containing transfusion guidelines to physicians at the control hospital failed to reduce blood consumption. However, a transient reduction in blood utilization was observed at the study hospital. CONCLUSION: The reduction was hypothesized to be due to a Hawthorne effect, in which the observed behavior is influenced by the subject's awareness of the research study.",0,1,
640,Efficacy of scientific detailing to optimize primary care physicians' drug prescribing behavior,"PURPOSE: To synthesize current knowledge on the effectiveness and magnitude of impact of Academic Detailing (AD) as a standalone intervention to change prescribing behaviors of primary care physicians (FPs). METHODS: Between January 1983 and July 2010, a search of all English-language articles was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases. We hand-searched the bibliographies of articles retrieved from electronic search to identify additional studies. Inclusion criteria were: full-length articles describing the original research; randomized controlled trial (RCT) or observational study design with a control group; AD studies delivered to FPs; AD as a standalone intervention; Drug Prescribing as Target Behavior. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Outcomes evaluated were: the difference in relative change in prescription rate between the intervention and control groups, the difference in absolute change in prescription rate between the intervention and control groups, and effect size calculated as the standardized mean difference. RESULTS: 11 RCTs and 4 observational studies were included Five RCTS described results demonstrating efficacy while 2 RCTs reported a beneficial effect on some of the target drugs Two observational studies found that AD was effective while 2 did not The median difference in relative change between of the studies reviewed was 21% (interquartile range 43.75%) for RCTs and 9% (interquartile range 8.5%) for observational studies. The median effect size among the studies reviewed was -0.09 (interquartile range 2.73). systematic review shows that AD in O optimizing drug prescribing by FPs can be effective. Although variable, the magnitude of the effect is moderate in most studies. This systematic review also provides evidence supporting the use of AD as a strategy to promote evidence-based drug prescribing or the incorporation of clinical guidelines into clinical practice.

641,Effectiveness of an acoustic reminder of hand hygiene compliance,"Multimodal interventions aim to improve compliance of healthcare workers with hand hygiene guidelines. Visitors are not primarily targeted, but can spread epidemic infections. Effective measures are needed to improve visitor compliance with hand hygiene guidelines to prevent transmission of epidemic infections into or out of healthcare facilities. Methods An acoustic hand hygiene reminder triggered by an electronic motion sensor was installed at the entrances to the hospital wards. An 8-month preinterventional and postinterventional study was conducted to measure compliance of hospital visitors and staff with hand hygiene guidelines. Results General hand hygiene adherence increased from 7.6% to 49.9% (p<0.001). Visitor and nonclinical staff adherence increased immediately from 10.6% to 63.7% and from 5.3% to 34.8%, respectively (P<0.001). Adherence from physicians, nurses, and physical therapists increased gradually from 4.5% to 38.3%, from 5.4% to 43.4%, and from 8.7% to 49.5%, respectively (p<0.001). Improved adherence to therapy was maintained in visitors and clinical staff (P<0.001), but not in nonclinical staff (P=0.341). Conclusions The electronic motion sensor immediately triggered an audible reminder and improved and sustained compliance with hand hygiene guidelines by hospital visitors and clinicians. This is an effective complement to multimodal hand hygiene measures and can help control epidemic infections.",0,1,

643,Efficacy of an information technology intervention to improve prophylactic antibacterial use in the postoperative period.,"Background A 2005 report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control Surgical Infection Prevention Program showed that only 41% of prophylactic antibiotics were correctly discontinued within 24 hours of the end of surgery. Electronic prescription records have shown promise as a means of integrating guideline information into electronic prescription entry systems and facilitating safer and more effective care. Aim The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of a computerized antibacterial prescription kit in order to increase the proportion of patients in whom antibacterial wound prophylaxis was discontinued in a reasonable time. Design The authors performed a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analysis over an 8-month study period with the implementation of a computerized ordering system designed to prevent excessive duration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Measurement The primary outcome was the proportion of surgeries using antibiotics that were terminated within a reasonable time frame. Additionally, we assessed the percentage of surgeries following the implementation of electronic intervention with chart documentation of infections among surgeries where the prescriber indicated treatment as a reason for antibacterial therapy. Results The computer-assisted prescription intervention significantly improved the proportion of surgeries with timely withdrawal of antibiotics from 38.8% to 55.7% (p<0.001) at the intervention hospital, while the control hospital remained at 56–57% (p=0.006 for the difference between treated and control hospitals). In post-intervention surgeries where a prescriber indicated treatment as the reason for antibacterial therapy, the prevalence of the infection documented in the table was only 14%. Conclusions A computer-based electronic prescription intervention increased the timely discontinuation of postoperative antibiotics.",0,1,
644,Efficacy of an intervention to improve adherence to the occupational physician guideline on the length of sick leave among employees with frequent mental disorders: A cluster-randomized controlled study,"Purpose Evidence-based guidelines in occupational health care improve the quality of care and can shorten the duration of illness. Despite this, compliance by occupational physicians (ORs) with guidelines is limited. Based on the literature on guideline implementation, an intervention was developed that has been shown to effectively improve self-reported adherence to OPs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether this intervention leads to an earlier return to work (RTW) in workers with common mental disorders (CMD). Methods In a two-arm randomized controlled cluster study, 66 OPs were randomized. The study included 3379 workers, 1493 in the intervention group and 1886 in the control group. Outcome measures were: time to complete RTW, time to first RTW, and total hours of sick leave. Cox regression analyzes and generalized linear mixed model analyzes were used for the evaluations. Results The median time to RTW was 154 days for the 3228 workers with TMD. There were no significant differences in (time to) complete RTW between intervention and control groups HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.81-1.15) or for the first RTW HR 0.96 (95% CI 0, 80-1:15) on. The average duration of sick leave was 478 hours in the intervention group and 483 hours in the control group. Conclusions The intervention to improve ORs' compliance with guidelines did not result in earlier RTW for workers with TMD managed by the ORs. Possible explanations are the remaining external barriers to guideline use and that perceived guideline compliance may not represent actual guideline compliance and improved care.

645,Effectiveness of brief training sessions in cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques for palliative care professionals,"We describe training in CBT techniques for 20 palliative care workers delivered over a six-month period as 12 days of equivalent instruction plus skill-building supervision. Tapes of the trainees' interactions with patients during their usual work were graded using a specially developed Cognitive First Aid Rating Scale (CFARS). The CFARS was of high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.93) and the interrater reliability was high. The trainees showed a significant increase in CBT competence over a period of six months (p = 0.001). After initial training, half of trainees were randomized to drop out of supervision"";"" Their measured CBT skills dropped, as did their self-reported confidence, when they were reassessed six months later, while those who continued to have supervision gained more skills and maintained their confidence (p=0.007). Palliative care professionals can be trained in CBT skills through a simple and short training course and supportive, skill-building supervision. These skills are consistent with national guidelines for providing psychological support to patients at all stages of cancer. Supervision is necessary to ensure the maintenance of skills and confidence in their use.",0,0,
646,Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for the treatment of dementia: review of evidence for a guideline for clinical practice,"Background: The effectiveness of US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacological therapies for dementia in achieving clinically relevant improvements is unclear. Purpose: To review the evidence for the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine) and the neuropeptide-modifying drug memantine in achieving clinically relevant improvements, primarily related to cognition, global function, behavior, and quality of life, e.g. in patients with dementia. Data sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, AgeLine and PsycINFO from January 1986 to November 2006. Study selection: English-language randomized controlled trials were included in the review if they used pharmacological agents for Evaluated adults diagnosed with dementia, did not use a crossover design, and had a quality score of at least 3 on the Jadad scale. Data extraction: Data on study characteristics and outcomes, including adverse events, were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated and the data combined where appropriate. Data synthesis: 96 publications representing 59 unique studies were eligible for this review. Both cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine had consistent effects on cognition and global assessment, but summary estimates showed small effect sizes. Outcomes in the areas of behavior and quality of life were evaluated less frequently and showed less consistent effects. Most studies were of short duration (6 months), which limited their ability to detect delays in the onset or progression of dementia. Three studies directly compared different cholinesterase inhibitors and found no differences in cognition and behavior. Limitations: Limitations of the available studies included short duration, enrollment of only patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, poor reporting of adverse events, lack of clear definitions of statistical significance, limited assessment of behavior and quality of life, and the limited direct comparison of different treatments. Conclusions: Treatment of dementia with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can lead to a statistically significant but clinically marginal improvement in cognitive and global assessment of dementia.",0,0,
647,Effectiveness of cooperative care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease in primary care: a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Most older adults with dementia are cared for by primary care physicians, but the primary care environment presents significant challenges to the delivery of quality care. AIM: To test the effectiveness of a collaborative care model for improving the quality of care for patients with Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Controlled clinical trial of 153 older adults with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers randomized by a physician to receive collaborative care management (n=84) or expanded usual care (n=69) in primary care practices within 2 Years to obtain US university health care systems from January 2002 to August 2004. Eligible patients (identified by screening or medical records) met diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease and had a self-identified caregiver. INTERVENTION: Intervention patients received 1 year of care management by an interdisciplinary team led by an experienced nurse working with the patient's family caregiver and integrated into primary care. The team used standard protocols to initiate treatment and to identify, monitor and treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, with an emphasis on non-pharmacological treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) administered at baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months. Secondary endpoints included the Cornell Scale of Depression in Dementia (CSDD), cognition, activities of daily living, resource use, and caregiver depression severity. RESULTS: Initiated by reports from caregivers, 89% of intervention patients triggered at least 1 protocol for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, with a mean of 4 per patient out of a total of 8 possible protocols. Intervention patients were more likely to receive cholinesterase inhibitors (79.8% vs. 55.1%; p=0.002) and antidepressants (45.2% vs. 27.5%; p=0.03). by total NPI score at 12 months (mean difference -5.6; p=0.01) and at 18 months (mean difference -5.4; p=0.01) Intervention caregivers also reported significant improvements in burden that NPI was measured by caregiver at 12 months;"" at 18 months, caregivers showed improvement in depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. There were no group differences in CSDD, cognition, activities of daily living, or hospitalizations, placement in nursing homes or deaths.CONCLUSIONS:Collaborative care for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease resulted in significant improvements in the quality of care and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in primary care patients and their caregivers.These improvements were achieved without the use of Significantly increase antipsychotics or sedative-hypnotics UNG: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00246896.",0,0,
648,Effectiveness of computer-based instruction in increasing rates of universal behaviors related to precaution.,"Background: Given the widespread non-compliance with universal precautions, an experimental study was designed to compare rates of universal precautions-related behaviors among nurses participating in computer-based instruction. This study also examined the relationship between rates of universal behaviors related to precautionary measures and subjects' demographic and experiential characteristics and history of occupational exposure to blood. METHODS: Data were collected using a questionnaire to collect information about the subjects' demographic and experiential characteristics and history of occupational exposure to blood. The Universal Precautions Assessment Tool was used to collect data on the rates of universal precautions-related behaviors in two groups of registered nurses with 30 subjects per group. Results: The null hypothesis was rejected by analysis of variance. The intervention used in this study increased behaviors related to taking universal precautions. Multiple regression was used to analyze the research question and none of the variables were significant. Forty (67.8%) subjects reported having suffered a needlestick or cut from a needle or sharp object that was actually or potentially contaminated with blood or bodily fluids. From these exposures, one patient was known to be HIV antibody positive. Conclusion: Replication studies of computer-based instructional interventions are needed, as are studies exploring other potentially effective interventions.",0,1,

651,Efficacy of guideline-based occupational health care when returning to work for workers with common mental disorders: design of a cluster-randomized controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Absence from sickness due to common mental disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety disorder, adjustment disorder) is a problem in many Western countries. Long-term sick leave has significant societal and financial costs. For workers with frequent mental disorders, the cost of illness is much higher than the medical cost. In the Netherlands, a best practice guide has been developed that promotes an activating approach by the occupational health practitioner to achieve a faster return to work by improving workers' problem-solving skills, particularly in relation to their work environment. Studies on this guideline indicate a promising association between guideline adherence and reduced sick leave duration, but also minimal guideline adherence by occupational physicians. Therefore, this study evaluates the effect of guideline-based care on full return to work for workers on sick leave for common mental disorders. Methods/design: This is a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled study with randomization at company doctor level. For one year, occupational physicians in the intervention group receive innovative training to improve their guideline-based care, while occupational physicians in the control group provide care as usual. A total of 232 employees who were on sick leave due to frequent mental disorders and who received advice from participating company doctors are included. The data is collected via the reporting system of the occupational health service and through questionnaires at the beginning of the study and after 3, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is time to full return to work. Secondary outcomes are partial return to work, total number of sick days, symptoms and ability to work. Personal and professional characteristics are the prognostic measures. Other parameters are coping, self-efficacy, remoralization, personal experiences, satisfaction with occupational health consultations and with contact with the supervisor, experiences and behavior of the supervisor, and extent of adherence to guidelines. DISCUSSION: If the results show that guideline-based care actually leads to faster and sustainable return to work, this study will help reduce personal, societal, and financial costs.

652,Efficacy of medical nutrition therapy administered by dietitians in the management of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled clinical trial.,"Aim To evaluate the effect of medical nutritional therapy (MNT) administered by dietitians on medical and clinical outcomes in adults with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and to compare MNT administered according to the practice dietary guidelines (PGC). . to MNT administered with Basal Nutrition (BC). Design A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial using two levels of MNT for metabolic control in individuals newly diagnosed with or currently being treated for NIDDM was conducted at diabetes centers in three states (Minnesota, Florida and Colorado). BC consisted of a single visit to a nutritionist; PGC included an initial visit to a dietician, followed by two visits during the first 6 weeks of the study period. Data were collected at study entry and at 3 and 6 months. Subject results are reported for 179 men and women aged 38 to 76 years: 85 were randomly assigned to BC and 94 to PGC. This represents 72% of the 247 enrolled subjects. An additional 62 adults with NIDDM at one site who had no contact with a dietician were impacted as a non-random comparison group identified. Outcomes Medical outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum lipid levels. Clinical outcomes included weight, body mass index, hip-to-hip ratio, and medical changes Therapy Statistical Analyzes The initial analysis of the discrete variables was performed using the ?2 statistic with Yates correction The initial Analysis of continuous variables was performed by analysis of variance. Changes in variables between periods w They were analyzed by paired t-test and comparisons between groups were analyzed using at-test for independent groups. Results At 6 months, PGC resulted in significant improvements in glycemic control as indicated by FPG and HbA1c levels, and BC resulted in significant improvements in HbA1c levels. Participants assigned to the PGC group had a mean FPG score at 6 months that was 10.5% lower than the score at entry, and those in the BC group had a 5.3% lower score. Among patients who had diabetes for more than 6 months, those who received PGC had significantly better HbA1c at 3 months than those who received BC. The comparison group showed no improvement in glycemic control over a comparable 6 months. PGC subjects showed significant improvements in cholesterol levels at 6 months, and subjects in both the PGC and BC groups had significant weight loss. Conclusions MNT provided by dieticians resulted in significant improvements in medical and clinical outcomes in both the BC and PGC groups and is beneficial for individuals with NIDDM. People with diabetes longer than 6 months tended to do better with PGC than with BC. Because of the upward trend in glucose levels at 3 months, continuous MNT by nutritionists is important for long-term metabolic control. J Am Diet Assoc. 1995;"" 95:1009-1017.",0,1,
653,Effectiveness of motivational interviewing in improving lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia supported by general practitioners: Dislip-EM study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The non-pharmacological approach to cholesterol control in patients with hyperlipidemia is based on the promotion of a healthy diet and physical activity. Therefore, in order to help patients change their habits, it is important to find the most effective approach. Many efforts have been made to explain changes in, or adherence to, certain health behaviors. These efforts have led to the development of theories that have been applied in prevention campaigns, involving brief counseling and counseling services. In this context, motivational interviewing has been shown to be effective in changing health behaviors in specific cases. However, more robust evidence is needed on the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in treating chronic pathologies - such as dyslipidemia - in patients cared for by general practitioners. This article describes a protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of MI versus general practice (brief consultation) with the aim of improving lipid level control in patients with dyslipidemia by a general practitioner. METHODS/DESIGN: An open-label, two-arm, parallel, multi-center, cluster, controlled, randomized, clinical study will be conducted. A total of 48-50 general practitioners from 35 public primary care centers in Spain will be randomized and recruit 436 patients with dyslipidemia. They conduct an intervention based on motivational interviewing or the usual brief counselling. After an initial assessment, follow-up visits are performed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 months. Primary endpoints are lipid levels (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and cardiovascular risk. The study will assess the degree of improvement in diet and physical activity, weight loss in obese patients and adherence to treatment guidelines. DISCUSSION: Motivational interviewing skills are the primary strategies primary care physicians use to treat their patients. Economical, simple, effective and applicable techniques are essential for healthcare professionals to help their patients make lifestyle changes and improve their health. This study will provide scientific evidence of the effectiveness of motivational interviewing and will be conducted under strict control of the data collected to ensure therapeutic integrity is maintained.

654,Effectiveness of motivational interviewing in patients with dyslipidemia: a randomized cluster study,"BACKGROUND: It is well known that getting people to change their habits is difficult. Identifying the most effective approach that General Practitioners (GPs) should use to help their patients change unhealthy habits is crucial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial intervention based on motivational interviewing conducted by general practitioners to increase lipid levels in patients with dyslipidemia compared to standard of care. METHODS: A multicenter, controlled, randomized, two-armed, cluster study with a 12-month follow-up conducted in 25 community health centers in Spain. 38 general practitioners and 227 primary care patients with uncontrolled dyslipidemia were included in the study. GPs delivered an intervention based on either motivational interviewing (MI) or standard practice. Lipid levels were measured and the level of control was analyzed based on clinical guideline criteria. RESULTS: 107 were assigned to the experimental group (EG) and 120 to the control group (CG). Overall, there was an improvement in total cholesterol (mean difference -MD- = -19.60""; 95% CI: -15.33 at -23.87 mg/dL; p<0.001), LDL-cholesterol (MD = - 13.78; 95% CI: -9.77 at -17.79 mg/dL; p<0.001) and triglycerides (MD = -19.14; 95% CI: -11.29 at -26.99 mg/dL; dl; p<0.001) No differences were found between the two groups, however, when we assessed the level of lipid control by combining the parameters cholesterol <200 mg/dl and LDL-cholesterol <130 mg/dl, it was observed that a higher percentage of patients achieving target EG compared to CG (13.1% vs 5.0%, adjusted OR = 5.77, 95% CI: 1.67-19.91) CONCLUSION: A motivational interview-based approach , carried out by general practitioners and addressed to patients with dyslipidemia, achieved a significant reduction in all lipid parameters, cardiovascular risk and weight reduction and compliance with the Mediterranean rdiet, similar to the usual intervention and superior in the proportion of pa patients achieving combined lipid control goals and physical activity level.

655,Efficacy of multicomponent interventions in primary health care to promote continuous smoking cessation in adults: a systematic review,"AIM: The aim of the present review is to evaluate primary care (PC) interventions with multiple components/complexes for their effectiveness in continuing smoking cessation in adult smokers. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials was conducted. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUDED STUDIES: Selected studies met the following criteria: assessed effects of a multicomponent/complex intervention (with 2 or more intervention components) in achieving at least 6 months abstinence in adult smokers who sought PC, biochemical confirmation of abstinence, intention -to-treat analysis and results published in English/Spanish. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA directive to report the review. We searched the following data sources: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus (from inception to February 2014), 3 major journals and a tobacco research bulletin. The checklists of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network were used to assess the methodological quality. Data selection, analysis, and extraction were performed independently using a paired review approach. Due to the heterogeneity of the interventions in the included studies, no meta-analysis was carried out. RESULTS: From 1147 identified references, 9 studies were selected (10,204 participants, up to 48 months follow-up, acceptable methodological quality). The methods used were mainly individual or group sessions, phone calls, smoking cessation brochures or kits, medication and economic incentives for doctors, and free medication for smokers. Complex interventions achieved long-term continuous abstinence between 7% and 40%. Behavioral interventions were effective and had a dose-response effect. Both nicotine replacement and bupropion therapy were safe and effective, with no observed differences. CONCLUSIONS: Multicomponent/complex interventions for PC are effective and safe, and appear to achieve longer-term sustained smoking cessation than usual care and counseling alone. Selected studies were heterogeneous and some had significant follow-up losses. Our results indicate that smoking interventions should include more than one component and intensive patient follow-up to maximize outcomes.",0,0,
656,Efficacy of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders,"BACKGROUND: Nurses typically provide day-to-day care for people with personality disorders. Consequently, it is important to determine how effective nursing interventions are for people with personality disorders, both in terms of general management and more specific therapeutic approaches. These are also topics of the current political and professional debate. However, the crucial question for planners, providers and clients of services is: What research evidence is there for effectiveness? It also needs to be determined what further research is needed to evaluate programs to control or change behavior. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to report a systematic literature review on the effectiveness of nursing interventions in people with personality disorders, whether performed by nurses alone or in combination with other health professionals. METHOD: The review was conducted according to the guidelines of the United Kingdom National Health Service Center for Reviews and Dissemination. Literature was identified by searching electronic databases, searching footnotes, hand-searching journals, and contacting study authors. Narrative synthesis was performed in relation to study design, participants, and type of intervention. RESULTS: Eighteen separate studies were included in the review: four randomized controlled studies, four non-randomized controlled studies, seven before-and-after studies, and three case studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a weak evidence base for what constitutes an effective nursing intervention in people with personality disorders. There is stronger evidence from interdisciplinary intervention studies than from nursing-only intervention studies. Studies of interventions based on psychological approaches show greater improvements in outcomes than studies of nursing management.",0,0,
657,Effectiveness of pharmacist care for patients with reactive airway disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context It is not known whether effective pharmacist-patient interactions improve patient outcomes. Objective To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical care program for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized controlled trial conducted at 36 community drug stores in Indianapolis, Indiana. We enrolled 1113 participants with active COPD or asthma from July 1998 to December 1999. Results were evaluated in 947 (85.1%) participants at 6 months and 898 (80.7%) at 12 months. Interventions The pharmaceutical care program (n=447) provided pharmacists with up-to-date patient-specific clinical data (peak expiratory flow rates [PEFRs], emergency department [ED] visits, hospitalizations, and medication compliance), training, customized patient education materials, and resources to facilitate program delivery. The PEFR monitoring control group (n=363) received a peak flow meter, instructions on how to use it, and monthly calls to determine PEFRs. However, no PEFR data was provided to the pharmacist. Patients in the normal care group (n = 303) received neither peak flow meters nor instructions on how to use them; no PEFR rates were collected from monthly telephone interviews. Pharmacists in both control groups received training but did not receive drug components Treatment intervention Key outcome measures Peak expiratory flow rates, respiratory-related emergency department visits or hospital visits, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), medication compliance, and patient satisfaction Outcomes At 12 months, patients receiving pharmaceutical care had significantly higher peak flow rates Rates than the usual care group (p=0.02) but not as PEFR monitoring controls (p=0.28) There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of medication compliance or HRQOL in asthmatic patients receiving a pharmaceutical Those receiving treatment had significantly more breathing problems at emergency room or hospital visits than the usual care group (odds ratio 2.16; 95% confidence interval 1.76-2.63; P<0.001). Patients receiving pharmaceutical care were more satisfied with their pharmacist than the usual care group (P=0.03) and the PEFR monitoring group (P=0.001), and were more satisfied with their health care than the usual care group after only 6 months (P=0.01). Despite numerous ways to implement the program, pharmacists only accessed patient-specific data about half the time and documented actions about half the time records were accessed. Conclusions This pharmaceutical care program increased patients' PEFRs compared to usual care, but provided little benefit compared to peak flow monitoring alone. Pharmaceutical care increased patient satisfaction, but also increased the amount of demand for respiratory-related medical care.",0,1,
658,Efficacy of physical therapy for patients with neck pain: an individualized approach using a clinical decision-making algorithm,"AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an individualized physical therapy intervention in the management of neck pain based on a clinical reasoning algorithm. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated by assessing changes in impairment, physical capacity, and disability in response to the intervention. Design: A treatment group of 30 patients with neck pain completed a physiotherapy session. The comfort control group was formed from a cohort group of 27 subjects who also had neck pain but did not receive treatment for various reasons. There were no significant differences between the groups in the demographics and the initial test scores of the outcome measures. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design was used. A physical therapist provided the treatment group with an eclectic intervention based on a clinical decision-making algorithm. Treatment outcome measures included the following five dependent variables: cervical range of motion, numerical pain score, time-weighted overhead endurance, the supine capital flexion endurance test, and the patient-specific functional scale. Both the treatment and control groups completed the initial and follow-up visits, with an average duration of 4 weeks between tests. Results: Five mixed analyzes of variance with follow-up tests showed a significant difference for all outcome measures in the treatment group compared to the control group. After an average of 4 weeks of physiotherapy intervention, patients in the treatment group showed a statistically significant increase in cervical range of motion, a decrease in pain, an increase in physical capacity, and a decrease in the degree of disability. The control group showed no differences in all five outcome variables between the initial and follow-up test results. Conclusions: This study outlined algorithm-based clinical reasoning strategies for the assessment and management of patients with cervical pain. The algorithm can help physicians classify patients with cervical pain into clinical patterns and provides pattern-specific guidelines for physical therapy interventions. An organized and specific physical therapy program was effective in improving the condition of patients with neck pain.",0,1,

Narrative synthesis plus meta-analyses using fixed-effects models, weighted mean differences, standardized effect sizes, and heterogeneity tests. RESULTS Six studies were identified, five of which were eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses. There was a small to moderate standardized effect size (0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.58) in favor of functional exercise for function three to four months postoperatively. There were also small to moderate weighted mean differences of 2.9 (0.61 to 5.2) for joint range of motion and 1.66 (-1 to 4.3) for quality of life in favor of functional exercise three to four months postoperatively . After a year, the benefits of the treatment were no longer apparent. CONCLUSIONS Interventions including post-discharge physiotherapy functional exercises result in short-term benefits after elective primary knee arthroplasty.

DESIGN A cluster-randomized study of information, subsidies, and incentives for school leaders to reduce anemia in their students. Enumerators and study participants were not informed of study arm assignment. SETTING 72 randomly selected rural primary schools in Northwest China. PARTICIPANTS 3553 fourth and fifth grade students aged 9-11 years. All fourth and fifth graders in sample schools participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS Sample schools were randomly assigned to a no-intervention control group or to one of three treatment arms: (a) an information arm in which school principals received information about anemia; (b) a grant arm, in which principals received information and unconditional subsidies;"" and (c) an incentive arm, in which principals received information, subsidies, and financial incentives to reduce anemia in students. Twenty-seven schools were assigned to the control arm (1816 students at baseline , 1623 at endpoint), 15 assigned to the information arm (659 students at baseline, 596 at endpoint), and 15 assigned to the subsidy arm (726 students at baseline, 667 at endpoint), and 15 assigned to the incentive arm (743 students at baseline, 667 am MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Student hemoglobin concentrations RESULTS Student mean hemoglobin concentration increased by 1.5 g/L (95% CI -1.1 to 4.1) in information schools, by 0.8 g/L (-1, 8 to 3.3) in subsidy schools and by 2.4 g/L (0 to 4.9) in incentive schools compared to the control group.This hemoglobin increase corresponded to a reduction in the prevalence of anemia (H b < 115 g/l) by 24% in special needs schools. Interactions with pre-existing incentives for school leaders to do well at school resulted in significantly larger gains in the information and incentive arms: when combined with incentives to do well at school, the associated impact on student hemoglobin concentration was 9.8 g/L (4.1 to 15.5). greater in information schools and 8.6 g/L (2.1 to 15.1) greater in performance schools.

661,Effectiveness of screening and brief alcohol intervention in primary care (SIPS study): pragmatic randomized controlled cluster study,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of different brief intervention strategies in reducing hazardous or harmful drinking in primary care. The hypothesis was that more intensive intervention would result in greater reductions in hazardous or harmful drinking. DESIGN Pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial. RECRUITMENT Primary care practices in the North East and South East of England and London. PARTICIPANTS 3562 patients 18 years and older routinely presenting in primary care, of whom 2991 (84.0%) were eligible to participate in the study: 900 (30.1%) tested positive for hazardous or harmful alcohol use and 756 ( 84.0%) received a brief intervention. The sample was predominantly male (62%) and white (92%), and 34% were current smokers. INTERVENTIONS The practices were randomized to three interventions, each building on the previous one: a patient briefing control group, five minutes of brief structured counseling, and 20 minutes of brief lifestyle counseling. The package leaflet and brief advice were handed out directly after the screening and a brief lifestyle consultation in a follow-up meeting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was patient self-reported hazardous or harmful alcohol use as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) at six months. A negative AUDIT result (score <8) indicated safe or safe drinking. Secondary endpoints measured a negative AUDIT result at 12 months, experience of alcohol-related problems (drinking problem questionnaire), health benefit (EQ-5D), use of services, and patients' motivation to change drinking behavior (willingness to change). an a Modified Ready Ruler. RESULTS Patient follow-up rates were 83% at six months (n=644) and 79% at 12 months (n=617). At both time points, an intention-to-treat analysis revealed no significant differences in AUDIT-negative status between the three interventions. Compared to the package leaflet group, the odds ratio for a negative AUDIT result was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.39) for the briefing and 0.78 (0.48 to 1.39) for the lifestyle briefing. 25). A per-protocol analysis confirmed these results. CONCLUSIONS All patients received simple feedback on their screening result. Beyond this input, however, there was no evidence that short advice or short lifestyle advice offered an important additional benefit in reducing dangerous or harmful drinking compared to the package leaflet.

662,Effectiveness of screening and treatment for depression in outpatients in need,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of screening and treatment for depression in ambulatory needy patients who visit primary care physicians. DESIGN: Two-group, randomized study (N=33 intervention, N=28 usual care) with baseline, 6-month, and 12-month outcome measures. SETTING: Internal Medicine Clinic. PATIENTS: Clinical patients over the age of 18 who tested positive for depression during a visit to their resident physician at PRIME-MD. Patients did not receive treatment or seek help for emotional problems. All patients were either enrolled in Medicaid or had an income below the poverty line. INTERVENTION: Resident physicians were trained to follow AHCPR (AHRQ; Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of depression in primary care. For patients in the intervention group, a screening nurse counseled residents about positive screening, provided them with a standardized draft protocol, and attempted to arrange behavioral support. Patients in the usual care group received the results of the screening from the screening nurse prior to their visit to the resident and were directed to seek treatment for their symptoms. MAIN RESULTS: Results for the primary endpoint of depression symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), showed that the intervention was successful in reducing symptoms compared to usual care (difference = -4.9 BDI points, P = 0.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], -9.8 to -0.005 effect size = -0.41). During the 12-month follow-up, 70% of intervention patients were treated for depression (91% with antidepressants), while 15% of standard care patients were treated with antidepressants for depression. Depression was identified in an additional 18% of the usual care group, but no treatment was identified. BDI differences between intervention and control groups were similar at the 6- and 12-month measurements. Quality of life and costs were also measured, but the differences between the groups were not significant in this respect. CONCLUSION: Screening and treatment of depression by private physicians was successful in reducing symptoms compared to usual care in a needy population. Almost twice as many intervention patients as controls with normal care showed a significant reduction (10 BDI points) in symptoms associated with depression.",0,0,
663,"Efficacy of dissemination strategies and implementation of clinical guidelines for the treatment of impacted and non-erupted third molars in primary dental care, a cluster-randomized controlled trial","AIM: To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for implementing guidelines using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline 42 “Management of unsupervised and impacted third molars” (published 2000) as a model. DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster RCT (2x2 factorial design). TOPICS: Sixty-three dental practices across Scotland. Clinical records of all 16- to 24-year-old patients over two, four-month periods in 1999 (pre-intervention) and 2000 (post-intervention) were searched by a clinical investigator blinded to the intervention group. Data on the costs of the interventions were also collected. INTERVENTIONS: Group 1 received a copy of the SIGN 42 guideline and had the opportunity to attend a Postgraduate Education Course (PGEC). In addition, Group 2 received audit and feedback (A and F). Group 3 received a Computer Aided Learning (CAL) package. Group 4 received A and F and CAL. KEY OUTCOME MEASURE: The proportion of patients whose treatment met the guideline. RESULTS: The weighted t-test for A and F versus no A and F (p=0.62) and CAL versus no CAL (p=0.76) were not statistically significant. Due to the effectiveness results (no difference), the profitability calculation became a cost minimization calculation. The minimal cost intervention in the study was to provide general dentists (GDPs) with guidance and the opportunity to take PGEC courses. Routine data, which later became available, showed a reduction in pre-data collection withdrawals across Scotland. CONCLUSION: In a setting where preinterventional compliance was unexpectedly high, neither CAL nor A and F increased dentists' compliance with the SIGN guideline compared to mailing the guideline and being able to attend a postgraduate course. The cost of the CAL arm of the study was higher than that of the A and F arms. More work is needed to understand dentist behavior in response to guideline implementation strategies.",0,1,

665,Efficacy of community pharmacist visits in patients with heart failure: HeartMed's randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To study whether drug review and symptom self-management and lifestyle counseling intervention by community pharmacists could reduce hospital admissions or mortality in patients with heart failure. DESIGN Randomized controlled trial. SETTING Home-based intervention in patients with heart failure. PARTICIPANTS 293 patients diagnosed with heart failure were enrolled after an emergency department visit (149 intervention, 144 control). INTERVENTION Two home visits by one of 17 community pharmacists within two and eight weeks of discharge. Pharmacists reviewed medications and provided symptom self-management and lifestyle advice. Controls received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the total number of hospital readmissions at six months. Secondary endpoints included mortality and quality of life (Questionnaire on Living in Minnesota with Heart Failure and EQ-5D). RESULTS Primary outcome data were available for 291 participants (99%). 136 (91%) intervention patients received one or two visits. 134 admissions occurred in the intervention group compared to 112 in the control group (rate ratio = 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.48"", P = 0.28, Poisson model). 30 intervention patients died compared to 24 controls (hazard ratio = 1.18). , 0.69 to 2.03; P=0.54). none of the differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION This pharmacist intervention did not result in a reduction in hospital admissions, in contrast to those found in studies of nurse-led heart failure interventions Given that heart failure accounts for 5% of hospital admissions, these findings pose a problem for policymakers who face a lack of specialized care and have hoped that qualified community pharmacists could achieve the same benefit.TEST REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN59427925.",0,0,
666,Effects of a behavior-independent financial incentive on the prescribing behavior of general practitioners,"Rationale and objectives: It is difficult to control prescribing behavior in general medicine. The purpose of this study was to assess the initial impact of a behavior-independent financial incentive on the volume of drug prescriptions by primary care physicians (GPs). DESIGN: 2-year controlled before-after study with an intervention region and a concurrent control region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Primary care physicians in two regions in the Netherlands (n=119 and n=118). INTERVENTION: A financial incentive to prescribe a specific drug or class of drugs, in accordance with local guidelines. The financial incentive consisted of a one-time payment that was independent of behavior. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Change in the number of prescriptions for 10 targeted drugs or drug groups. RESULTS: Significant changes were observed only with three types of antibiotics and with the recommended gastric drugs. In almost all cases, the effects were temporary. Conclusion: Non-behaviour-independent financial incentives can help to change primary care physician prescribing behavior, but the effects are localized and transient.",0,0,

669,"Impact of a multifaceted intervention on cardiovascular risk factors in high-risk hypertensive patients: the ESCAPE study, a pragmatic cluster-randomized study in general practice","BACKGROUND: Several observational studies of hypertensive patients have revealed a discrepancy between the therapeutic goals recommended in guidelines and those achieved in daily practice. The aim of the ESCAPE study was to determine whether a multifaceted intervention focused on general practitioners (GPs) could significantly increase the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention who met all of their recommended therapeutic goals. METHODS: A pragmatic, cluster-randomized study with 257 general practitioners randomized by region. The general practitioners in the intervention group had a one-day training course and received an electronic blood pressure monitor and a short recommendation brochure. In addition to the usual follow-up, they focused on a consultation on hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors every six months for two years. They also received feedback on their patients' clinical and biological parameters at baseline and after one year. The main outcome measures were the change in the proportion of patients who achieved all of their therapeutic goals and each individual therapeutic goal at two years, and quality of life. RESULTS: 1,832 high-risk hypertensive patients were included. After two years, the proportion of patients achieving all of their therapeutic goals increased significantly in both groups, but significantly more in the intervention group: OR (odds ratio) 1.89, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 3 .27, P=0.02). ). Significantly more patients achieved their blood pressure goals in the intervention group than in the usual care group: OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.88, p<0.0001). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly more in the intervention group than in the usual care group, by 4.8 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively (p<0.0001 for both). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of physical and mental quality of life. CONCLUSION: An easy-to-deliver, multifaceted intervention targeting primary care physicians only significantly increased the proportion of high-risk hypertensive patients in primary prevention who met their recommended therapeutic goals.

670,Effects of brief treatment with eszopiclone on continuous positive airway pressure adherence,"Background: Short-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compliance can predict long-term use. Unfortunately, initial CPAP intolerance can lead to poor adherence to therapy or discontinuation of therapy. Aim: To determine whether a short course of eszopiclone at baseline improves long-term CPAP compliance more than placebo in adults with obstructive sleep apnea. Design: Parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled study from March 2007 to December 2008. Randomization, maintained and hidden centrally by pharmacy staff, was computer-generated using fixed blocks of 10. Referring physicians, investigators, and patients were opposed to treatment assignment until after the final data blinded were collected. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00612157) Setting: Academic Center for Sleep Disorders. Patients: 160 adults (mean age 45.7 years [SD, 7.3]); mean apnea-hypopnea index, 36.9 events/h [SD , 23]) with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea who initiated CPAP. Intervention: Eszopiclone, 3 mg (n?=76) or matched placebo (n?=78) for the first 14 nights of CPAP. Measurements: CPAP use was measured weekly for 24 weeks. CPAP adherence (primary endpoint) and rates of CPAP discontinuations and improvement in symptoms (secondary endpoints) were compared. Follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 months was performed of 150, 136, and 120 patients completed Results: Patients in the eszopiclone group used CPAP for 20.8% more nights (95% CI, 7.2% to 34.4%; P?=0.003), 1.3 hours more per night for all nights (CI, 0.4 to 2.2 hours; P? = 0.005) and 1.1 more hours of CPAP use per night (CI, 0.2 to 2.1 hours; P? = 0.019 ). The hazard ratio for stopping CPAP was 1.90 (CI, 1.1 to 3.4; P? = 0.03 3) times higher in the placebo group. Side effects were reported in 7.1% of patients and did not differ between groups. Limitations: Patients had severe obstructive sleep apnea treated at a specialized sleep center with frequent follow-up; results may not be generalizable to different CPAP settings and reasons for discontinuation have not been assessed. Conclusion: Compared to placebo, a short course of eszopiclone during the first 2 weeks of CPAP therapy improved adherence and resulted in fewer patients discontinuing therapy.

671,Effects of an automated electronic reminder in changing antiplatelet prescribing behavior among Italian general practitioners in diabetics: an intervention study,"AIM – To evaluate whether an electronic reminder integrated into a routine computer system increases the use of antiplatelet drugs in diabetics among Italian General Practitioners (GPs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 300 general practitioners and their patients selected from the Health Search Database. Of these, 150 GPs (intervention group) received instructions to activate an electronic reminder and a letter summarizing the beneficial effects of antiplatelet therapy in diabetics with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor (“high risk”), the other 150 GPs (control group) received only the letter. The electronic reminder, integrated into a standard software system for managing daily clinical routine, was displayed when each participating general practitioner opened the medical records of diabetic patients aged 30 years. Only high-risk diabetics were included in the analysis. Patients were considered for antiplatelet treatment if they received two or more prescriptions at baseline and during follow-up. RESULTS - We selected 15,343 high-risk diabetics, 7,313 from control group GPs and 8,030 from intervention group GPs. A total of 1672 patients (22.9%) in the control group and 1886 (23.5%) patients in the intervention group received antiplatelet therapy at baseline (P = NS). At the end of the follow-up, the number of treated patients in the intervention group (odds ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.79-2.22) was significantly higher than in the control group. The effect of electronic reminder was more relevant in patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors but no prior cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) than in patients with CVDs.

672,Effects of an Evidence Service on the Use of Research Evidence by Community-Based AIDS Service Organizations: A Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background To support the use of research evidence by community-based organizations (CBOs), we have developed Synthesized HIV/AIDS Research Evidence (SHARE), an evidence service for those working in the HIV sector. SHARE consists of several components: an online searchable database of HIV-related systematic reviews (retrievable based on a taxonomy of HIV/AIDS-related topics and an open text search), regular email updates, access to user-friendly summaries; "" and peer relevance ratings. Our goal is to assess whether this ""full-serve"" evidence service increases the use of research evidence by CBOs compared to a ""self-service"" evidence service. Methods/Design We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) along with a subsequent qualitative process study to further investigate the results. All CBOs affiliated with the Canadian AIDS Society (n=120) will be invited to participate and will be randomly assigned to receive either the ""full-serve"" version of SHARE or the ""self-service"" version (a list of relevant systematic reviews with links to PubMed records and worksheets that help CBOs find and use research evidence) using a simple randomized design. All managers and employees of each organization get access to the version of SHARE that their organization is associated with. The test duration is 10 months (two-month baseline period, six-month intervention period and two-month crossover period), the primary outcome measure is the average number of enrollments/month/organization (averaged over the number of users from each organization) between the baseline and the end of the intervention period. The secondary outcome is the intent to use research evidence measured through a survey conducted at a key decision maker from each organization. For the qualitative study, one key organizational decision maker will be specifically selected from 15 organizations in each study arm (n=30). Semi-structured one-on-one interviews are conducted by telephone about their views on and experiences with the evidence service they received, how helpful it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and least helpful and why and recommendations for next steps.

673,Impact of an evidence service on the use of research evidence by health system decision makers: A protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background Health care policy makers need timely access to synthesized research results to inform policy making. No efforts to address this need have been evaluated using an experimental quantitative design. We have developed an evidence service that draws input from Health Systems Evidence, a database of policy relevant systematic reviews. The reviews were categorized (a) by topic and review type; (b) coded by the last year in which studies were searched for and the countries in which included studies were conducted; (c) assessed for quality;' and (d) links to available user-friendly summaries, scientific abstracts and full-text reports. Our goal is to assess whether a ""full-serve"" evidence service increases the use of synthesized research evidence by policy analysts and consultants at the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) compared to a ""self-serve"" evidence service. Methods/Design We will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) along with a subsequent qualitative process study to further investigate the results. For the RCT, all policy analysts and policy advisors (n=168) in a single department of the MOHLTC are invited to participate.

674,Effects of computer reminders for influenza vaccination on morbidity during influenza epidemics.,"To examine the impact of computer-generated reminders for influenza vaccination in patients at high risk of winter lung disease, we selected 4555 such patients from a population of 15,000 adults who participated in a three-year randomized trial of reminders for prevention. The physicians who received the reminders vaccinated eligible patients twice as often as the control physicians (P=0.0001). There was a linear increase in influenza incidence in our region during the three winters studied (from 1000 to 33,451 to 71,075 cases per year), and we modeled the percentage of patients with hospitalizations, emergency room visits with chest X-rays, and blood gas determinations as a logistic function this increase. The difference in linear trends between patients in the intervention group (whose physicians received reminders) and those in the control group was significant for emergency department visits (p < 0.05), hospitalizations (p < 0.01), and blood gases (P less than 0.001).

675,Effects of computer reminders on peripheral venous catheter complications and guideline adherence in pediatric nurse care--a cluster-randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Reminder systems in electronic medical records (EHR) have been shown to affect both healthcare professional behavior and patient outcomes. The aim of this cluster-randomized study was to investigate the impact of implementing a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for peripheral venous catheters (PVK) in pediatric care, in the form of reminders integrated into the EPAs, on PVC-related complications and on registered self-reported Adherence to the guideline by RNs. Another aim was to examine the relationship between contextual factors and outcomes of the intervention. Methods: The study included 12 inpatient wards of a pediatric university hospital. The reminders covered the choice of PVC, hygiene, maintenance and daily inspection of the PVC plant. The primary endpoint was documented signs and symptoms of PVC-related complications at removal retrieved from the EPR. The secondary outcome was nurse adherence to a PVC policy, which was collected via a questionnaire that also included nurses' perceived work context, measured with the Alberta Context Tool. The units were divided into two tiers based on the occurrence of PVCs. A blinded single drawing of lots from each stratum randomized six units to the control and intervention groups, respectively. Units were not blinded. The intervention group included 626 PVCs at baseline and 618 post-intervention, and the control group comprised 724 PVCs at baseline and 674 post-intervention. At baseline, 212 (65.4%) and 208 (71.5%) RNs were included after the intervention. RESULTS: No significant effect was found for computer recalls on PVC-related complications or on RNs' adherence to guideline recommendations. The complication rate at baseline and after the intervention was 40.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 36.7-44.5) and 41.9% (95% CI 38.0-45.8) for the intervention group and 40 .3% (95% CI 36.8-44.0). ) and 46.9% (95% CI 43.1-50.7) for the control. In general, nurses' self-rated work context varied from moderately low to moderately high, indicating that conditions for successful implementation were less than optimal. CONCLUSIONS: The warnings could potentially have been accompanied by a tailored intervention targeting specific barriers such as the low frequency of recorded reasons for removal, low compliance with daily inspection of PVC sites, and lack of regular feedback to RNs.

676,Implications of computerized guidelines for the treatment of heart disease in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Electronic information systems have been proposed as a means to reduce medical errors (doing the wrong thing) and omissions (not treating indicated). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of computer-assisted cardiac care proposals. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial for general practitioners and pharmacists. SUBJECTS: A total of 706 outpatients with heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease. ACTIONS: Evidence-based cardiac care proposals, approved by a panel of local cardiologists and general internists, were presented to physicians and pharmacists in the care of enrolled patients. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence to care recommendations, general and condition-specific quality of life, acute exacerbations of their heart disease, medication compliance, healthcare costs, satisfaction with care, and physician attitudes to guidelines. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 1 year during which they made 3,419 primary care visits and were eligible for 2,609 separate cardiac care proposals. The intervention had no impact on physicians' adherence to treatment recommendations (23% in intervention patients vs. 22% in control patients). There were no intervention-control differences in quality of life, medication compliance, health care utilization, cost, or satisfaction with care. Physicians viewed guidelines as helpful information, but limiting their practice and not helpful in making decisions for individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment suggestions generated by a sophisticated electronic medical record system failed to improve adherence to accepted practice guidelines or outcomes for patients with cardiac disease. Future studies must weigh the benefits and costs of different (and perhaps more draconian) methods of influencing clinical behavior.",1,1,
677,Effects of family doctor training and family support services on the care of dementia patients in the home environment - results of a controlled cluster-randomized study,"BACKGROUND: More than 90% of dementia patients are cared for by their general practitioners, who are instrumental in diagnosis, therapy and recommendation of support services. AIM: To test whether special training of general practitioners changes the care of dementia patients through their systematic recommendation of care counseling and self-help groups. METHOD: 129 general practitioners enrolled 390 dementia patients and their informal caregivers in a prospective, three-arm, cluster-randomized, 2-year study. Arm A represented the usual care, in arms B and C self-help groups and care counseling (in arm B one year after the start of the study, in arm C at the start of the study) were recommended by the primary care physicians. The general practitioners received arm-specific training. The diagnostic and therapeutic behavior of the physicians was recorded at the start of the study. In the 2-year follow-up, informal caregivers were asked about the use of support services. Results: The diagnostic behavior of general practitioners corresponds to the relevant guidelines. The procedure for newly diagnosed patients does not differ from patients who have already been diagnosed, with the exception of the referral rate to a specialist. About a third of newly diagnosed dementia patients receive an anti-dementia drug. Utilization of self-help groups and counseling increased fivefold and fourfold, respectively. Utilization of other support services remained low (<10%), with the exception of home nursing and short-term institutional care. Conclusion: Trained general practitioners usually act in accordance with the guidelines in dementia diagnostics and partially in accordance with the guidelines with regard to the recommended drug therapy. Recommendations for support services for caring relatives by the general practitioner are successful. They cause a significant increase in the use of the recommended services compared to offers that are not recommended by the general practitioner. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN68329593.",0,0,
678,Impact of Interactive Voice Response Self-Monitoring on Natural Resolution of Alcohol Problems: Usage and Behavioral Economics Factors.,"Aim: Most problem drinkers do not seek help, and many recover on their own. Whether assistive interactive voice response (IVR) self-monitoring facilitates such ""natural"" resolutions was investigated in a randomized controlled trial. Based on behavioral economics, it was hypothesized that the impact on drinking outcomes varies with drinkers' basic ""time horizons"", reflecting preferences between goods of different values, available via different delays and with their IVR usage. Method: Recently resolved, untreated problem drinkers were randomized to a 24-week IVR self-monitoring program (n = 87) or a control-only condition (n = 98). Baseline interviews assessed outcome predictors, including behavioral economic measures of reward preferences (discounting delays, pre-dissolution money allocation for alcohol vs. savings). The six-month results were categorized as abstinent-resolved, non-abstinent-resolved, unresolved, or missing. Compler Average Causal Effect (CACE) models examined IVR self-monitoring effects. Results: IVR self-monitoring compliers (>=70% completed scheduled calls) were older and had greater pre-resolution alcohol control and lower rebates than non-compliers (<70%). A CACE model interaction showed that observed compliance adherents in the IVR group with shorter time horizons (as expressed by higher pre-dissolution alcohol expenditures than savings) were more likely to achieve moderation than abstinent dissolutions compared to predicted compliance adherents in the Control group with shorter time horizons and with all noncompliers. Intention-to-treat analysis models showed no IVR-related effects. More balanced spending on savings versus alcohol predicted moderation for both approaches. Conclusions: IVR interventions should consider factors affecting IVR use and drinking outcomes, including individual-specific behavioral economic variables. CACE models provide tools for evaluating expanded participation interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,

681,Efficacy and safety of sucrose for procedural pain relief in preterm and newborn infants,"BACKGROUND: Premature and acutely ill neonates admitted to a NICU undergo multiple common invasive and painful procedures aimed at improving their outcome. Although several studies have been developed to determine the efficacy of sucrose for treating surgical pain in preterm and acutely ill neonates, these have generally lacked methodological rigor and have not provided physicians with clear practice guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of three interventions for alleviating procedural pain associated with heel pricking in preterm and term newborns, and to investigate the influence of contextual factors such as gender, disease severity, and prior painful procedures on pain responses. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 190 neonates were stratified by gestational age and then randomized to receive (a) sucrose and non-nutritional sucking (n=64), (b) sucrose alone (n=62), or (c) sterile water and non-nutritional sucking (control) (n = 64) to assess efficacy (pain response as measured by the Premature Infant Pain Profile) (Stevens, Johnson, Petryshen, & Taddio, 1996) and safety (side effects) after a scheduled heel prick during the first week of life. Stratification was used to control for the effects of age on pain response. RESULTS: There were significant differences in pain response between treatment groups (F=22.49, p<0.001), with the sucrose and no nutritive sucking groups having the lowest mean pain profile scores in preterm infants. Efficacy of sucrose after heel prick was not affected by disease severity, postnatal age, or number of painful procedures. Intervention group and gender explained 12% of the variance in pain profile scores for preterm infants. Few adverse events occurred (n=6), and none required medical or nursing intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sucrose and non-nutritive sucking is the most effective intervention for single-heel pricking. Studies on the effects of gestational age on the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of sucrose are needed.",0,0,

683,Efficacy of cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy used by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder: a research protocol,"BACKGROUND: Contrary to the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines, the most common treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders in primary care is pharmacological. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral intervention performed by primary care psychologists in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder compared to usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an open label, multicenter, randomized and controlled study with two parallel groups. A random sample of 246 patients with mild to moderate mixed anxiety-depressive disorder will be recruited from the target population on the lists of 41 general practitioners. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group, which will receive standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy administered by psychologists along with usual care, or a control group, which will receive only usual care. The cognitive behavioral therapy intervention consists of eight individual 60-minute face-to-face sessions conducted over eight consecutive weeks. A follow-up session is conducted 6 months after the procedure by phone for reinforcement or referral, as needed. The primary outcome variable is change in Short Form-36 General Health Survey scores. We will also measure the change in frequency and intensity of anxiety symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months later. In addition, we will collect information on drug use and health services. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a primary care physician's cognitive-behavioural intervention in patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. International scientific evidence has shown the need for psychologists in primary care. However, given the differences between health policies and health services, it is important to test the impact of these psychological interventions in our geographic setting.

684,Efficacy of a nurse-led email reminder program in reducing the risk of cardiovascular prevention in hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Many strategies have been evaluated to improve the prevention and control of cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. Individualized lifestyle education programs for telephone and teleconsultation care have been found to improve blood pressure control and adherence to lifestyle recommendations. This study tested the effectiveness of a nurse-led email reminder program (NRP-e) in improving CVD risk factors in adults with hypertension. METHODS: All participants received standard CVD prevention and a guideline-based educational program. Subjects in the NRP-e group also received weekly email notifications and phone calls from a care provider for 6 months. The emails included a reminder program to follow a healthy lifestyle based on current guidelines. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months after admission; randomization was centralized and blood samples were evaluated in a single laboratory. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 98 (control) and 100 (NRP-e) subjects (mean age 59.0 +/- 14.5 years; 51.0% males). After 6 months, the following CVD risk factors improved significantly in both groups: body mass index, alcohol and fruit consumption, cigarette smoking, adherence to therapy times, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and total cholesterol, triglycerides and physical activity. However, in the NRP-e group, the prevalence of several risk behaviors or conditions decreased significantly more than in the control group: obesity (-16%), low fruit consumption (-24%), uncontrolled hypertension (-61%). , LDL (-56%) and total cholesterol (-40%). CONCLUSIONS: The NRP-e improved a number of CVD risk factors. The program was low in cost, required an average of <20 minutes per day in addition to normal practice, and may merit further evaluation for inclusion in existing nursing management approaches.",0,0,
685,Effectiveness of a self-help manual for increasing resilience in caregivers of adults with depression in Thailand,"Caring for a person with a mental illness can have adverse effects on family carers', but little is known about how best to help these family carers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral-led self-help manual in increasing resilience in caregivers of people with depression compared to caregivers receiving only routine support. A randomized controlled trial was conducted according to CONSORT guidelines , where 54 nurses received a parallel intervention (self-help manual) (n = 27) or control groups (standard support) (n = 27). Exercise capacity was assessed at baseline, post-test (week 8), and at follow-up (week 12). Intention-to-treat analyzes were performed. Repeated ANOVA measures indicated a significant difference in resilience scores between the three time points, demonstrating a large effect. Pairwise comparisons between intervention and control groups showed resilience between baseline and post-test and between baseline and follow-up, but not between Post test and follow up. Overall, the intervention group showed a slightly greater increase in resilience over time than the control group; however, the time-group interaction was not significant. Guided self-help is helpful in improving the resilience of caregivers and could be used to supplement the limited support provided to caregivers by psychiatric nurses and other clinicians.",0,0,
686,Efficacy of evidence-based clinical decision support in general practice,"Significance There is consensus that the inclusion of clinical decision support in electronic health records will improve quality of care, contain costs and reduce overtreatment, but this potential has yet to be demonstrated in clinical trials. Aim To evaluate the impact of a tailored evidence-based clinical decision support tool on management of respiratory infections and on the effectiveness of integrating evidence at the point-of-care. Design, Setting and Participants In a randomized clinical trial, we implemented 2 well-validated built-in clinical prediction rules, namely the Walsh rule for streptococcal pharyngitis and the Heckerling rule for pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN RESULTS AND MEASURES The intervention group had access to the integrated clinical prediction rules tool and decided whether to fill out risk assessment calculators, order medications, and create progress notes to help with complex decisions at the point of care. Results The intervention group completed the integrated clinical prediction rule tool at 57.5% of visits. Providers in the intervention group were significantly less likely to order antibiotics than those in the control group (age-adjusted relative risk 0.74 inches; 95% CI 0.60-0.92). The absolute risk of the intervention was 9.2% and the required number of treats was 10.8. The intervention group was significantly less likely to order rapid strep testing than the control group (relative risk 0.75; 95% CI 0.58-0.97; P?=?.03). Conclusions and Relevance The integrated clinical prediction rule process to integrate complex evidence-based clinical decision-making reports is of relevant importance for national initiatives such as ""Meaningful Use"".",0,1,
687,Efficacy of a standardized manual therapy and home exercise program in chronic rotator cuff disease: randomized placebo-controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a program of manual therapy and exercise compared to placebo treatment by physical therapists for people with chronic rotator cuff disease. DRAFT Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Participant- and Single-Investigator-Blinded Trial. SETTING Melbourne metropolitan area, Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 120 participants with chronic (>3 months) rotator cuff disease who were recruited from physicians and from the community. INTERVENTIONS Active treatment included manual therapy and a home exercise program; placebo treatment included inactive ultrasound therapy and application of an inert gel. Participants in both groups received 10 sessions of individual standardized treatment over 10 weeks. For the following 12 weeks, the active group continued the home exercise program and the placebo group received no treatment. Perceived global assessment of overall change RESULTS 112 (93%) participants completed the 22-week study At 11 weeks, there was no difference between groups in change in shoulder pain and disability index (3.6, 95% confidence interval -2.1 to 9, 4) or noted change in pain (0.7, -0.1 to 1.5);"" both groups showed significant improvements. More participants in the active group reported a successful outcome (defined as ""much better""), though the difference was not statistically significant: 42% (24/57) of the active participants and 30% (18/61) of the placebo participants (relative risk 1.43, 0.87 to 2.34).The active group showed post At 22 weeks, there was a significantly greater improvement in shoulder pain and disability index than the placebo group (difference between groups 7.1; 1.7) or for the percentage of participants reporting a successful treatment outcome (relative risk o 1.39, 0.94 to 2.03). Several secondary endpoints favored the active group, including shoulder pain and disability index functional score, muscle strength, activity impairment, and quality of life. CONCLUSION A standardized program of manual therapy and home exercise provided no additional immediate benefit for pain and function compared to realistic placebo treatment controlling therapist contact in middle-aged to elderly adults with chronic rotator cuff disease. However, greater improvements were seen at follow-up, particularly in shoulder function and strength, suggesting that the benefits of active treatment are taking longer to manifest.

688,Effectiveness of guidelines and training program: A training process for diagnosing low back pain,"BACKGROUND: The Italian National Health Plan has included low back pain (LBP) among the pathologies for which clinical guidelines should be established and disseminated. Changing the clinical behavior of physicians requires forms of intervention whose effectiveness is not fully known. OBJECTIVES: This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention, including educational materials, lectures, workshops, and local consensus processes, to modify the clinical management of LBP by general practitioners (GP). METHODS: Changes in diagnostic capacity were assessed by a controlled (before/after) study based on frequency of etiologic diagnoses of LBP, assessment of clinical knowledge with multiple-choice tests, and on priorities in confronting problems the treatment of LBP were assigned to the three general practitioner groups who had voluntarily participated in the study. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase in diagnostic capacity (frequency of exact answers in the multiple-choice test) was achieved. There has also been a shift in priorities in addressing problems in the management of LBP, from diagnosis as the primary problem before intervention to communicating with the patient. CONCLUSIONS: In the Italian context, the study also confirms the efficiency of a multifaceted intervention based on a training process aimed at modifying the clinical behavior of the GP in relation to LBP.",0,0,
689,EHRA Research Network Surveys: 6 years of EP Wire activity,"Clinical practice should follow guidelines and recommendations based primarily on the results of controlled studies, often conducted in selected populations and under specific conditions, while clinical practice may be influenced by factors different from controlled scientific studies. Therefore, the real environment is better assessed by the observational registries, which enroll patients for longer periods of time. However, this can be difficult, expensive and time consuming. In 2009, the Scientific Initiatives Committee of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) initiated a series of surveys addressing controversial issues in clinical electrophysiology (EP). With this in mind, an EHRA-EP research network was created, comprising EP centers in Europe, among which the 'hot topic' surveys were disseminated. This review summarizes the overall experience of performing EP wires over the last 6 years, categorizes and ranks the issues regarding clinical EP, and assesses the acceptability and feedback from the responding centers to improve survey participation and research needs to address efforts of the European EP community.",0,0,
690,Electronic alerts to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients,"BACKGROUND Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized patients is still underutilized. We hypothesized that using a computer alert program to promote prophylaxis could reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in high-risk hospitalized patients. METHODS We developed a computer program linked to the patient database to identify consecutive hospitalized patients at risk for deep vein thrombosis without prophylaxis. The program used medical record numbers to randomly assign 1,255 eligible patients to an intervention group in which the responsible physician was alerted to a patient's risk of deep vein thrombosis and 1,251 patients to a control group in which no alert was issued. The physician had to acknowledge the alarm and could then refuse or order prophylaxis including graduated compression stockings, pneumatic compression boots, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or warfarin. The primary endpoint was clinically diagnosed, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days. RESULTS More patients in the intervention group than in the control group received mechanical prophylaxis (10.0 percent vs. 1.5 percent, P<0.001) or pharmacologic prophylaxis (23.6 percent vs. 13.0 percent, P<0.001) . The primary endpoint occurred in 61 patients (4.9 percent) in the intervention group versus 103 (8.2 percent) in the control group,” according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the probability of being free of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 90 days were 94.1 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 92.5 to 95.4 percent) and 90.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88.7 to 92.2 percent) (P < 0.001) respectively Computer alert reduced the risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism by 41 percent at 90 days (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.81; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS The establishment of a computer alert program increased the use of prophylaxis by physicians and significantly reduced the rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in at-risk patients hospitalized.",1,1,
691,Electronic alerts versus on-demand decision support to improve dyslipidemia treatment: a randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Indirect evidence shows that alerting users with clinical decision support systems appears to change behavior more than requiring users to actively initiate the system. However, randomized trials comparing these methods in a clinical setting are lacking. We examined the effect of both alerting and on-demand decision support in relation to the screening and treatment of dyslipidemia based on the guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a clustered randomized study design, 38 Dutch general practices (77 physicians) and 87,886 of their patients (39,433 men aged 18 to 70 years and 48,453 women aged 18 to 75 years) used the ELIAS electronic medical record. Each practice was assigned to receive notifications, on-demand support, or no intervention. We measured the percentage of patients who were screened and treated after 12 months of follow-up. In the alert group, 65% of patients requiring screening were screened (relative risk versus control = 1.76"", 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 2.20) compared to 35% of patients in the need group (relative risk versus control = 1.28; 95% confidence interval 0.98 to 1.68) and 25% of patients in the control group In the warning group, 66% of the patients requiring treatment were treated (relative risk versus control = 1.40; 95% -Confidence interval: 1.15 to 1.70) ) compared to 40% of patients (relative risk versus control = 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.50) in the on-demand group and 36% of patients in the control group CONCLUSIONS: The alerting version of the Clinical Decision Support System significantly improved screening and treatment performance for dyslipidemia by general practitioners.",1,1,
692,Electronic Antibiotic Stewardship - Reduced use of broad spectrum antibiotics using a computerized antimicrobial licensing system in a hospital setting.,"Objectives Antibiotic stewardship is important, but the ideal strategy for delivering stewardship in a hospital setting is unknown. A practical, sustainable and transferrable strategy is needed. This study evaluates the impact of a novel computerized antimicrobial drug approval system on antibiotic prescribing behavior in a hospital setting. The effects on drug consumption, antibiotic resistance patterns of local bacteria, and patient outcomes were monitored. Methods The study was conducted at a referral tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The system was introduced in January 2005 and directed the use of 28 restricted antimicrobials. Data was collected over 7 years: 5 years before and 2 years after deployment. The uptake of the system was assessed using a built-in audit trail. Drug use was prospectively monitored using pharmacy data (defined as daily doses per 1000 bed days) and analyzed using time series analysis with segmental linear regression. Antibiograms of local bacteria were evaluated prospectively. In-hospital mortality and length of stay in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia have also been reported. Results In 2006, between 250 and 300 registrations were registered monthly. The gradients using third and fourth generation cephalosporins (+0.52, -0.05, -0.39""; P<0.01), glycopeptides (+0.27, -0.53; P=0 .09), carbapenems (+0.12, -0.24; P=0.21), aminoglycosides (+0.15, -0.27; P<0.01), and quinolones (+0.76, + 0.11; ""P = 0.08) all fell after use, while extended-spectrum penicillin use increased.

693,E-Isotretinoin Electronic Prescribing Chart: Improving Physician Adherence to Isotretinoin Prescribing Guidelines,"Oral isotretinoin is a highly effective treatment for refractory nodulocystic acne. However, it can be associated with serious side effects such as teratogenicity and hepatitis. Inadequate cumulative dosing can also lead to decreased therapeutic efficacy and higher disease relapse. A preliminary review had previously found poor and inconsistent compliance by physicians with local isotretinoin prescribing guidelines. To achieve greater than 90% adherence to isotretinoin guidelines for all acne patients prescribed systemic isotretinoin at the National Skin Centre, Singapore, key areas and the reasons for non-compliance were identified. Within the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, a purpose-built “one-stop” isotretinoin electronic spreadsheet has been introduced to address key areas of safety”; namely, patient informed consent, pregnancy testing, baseline laboratory testing, and automatic calculation of cumulative and target doses of isotretinoin. Physician adherence to prescribing guidelines improved from a baseline of 50-60% to greater than 90% (range 95-100%) for 30 consecutive months after the intervention. The E-Isotretinoin graph has resulted in a significant improvement in physician compliance with isotretinoin prescribing guidelines and underscores the utility of EMR technology in influencing physician safe prescribing behavior.",0,1,
694,Decision support for electronic health records and quality of care for children with ADHD.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of electronic health record (EHR) decision support on physician management and documentation of care for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: This study enrolled 79 general pediatricians in 12 pediatric primary care practices using the same EHR and caring for 412 children aged 5 to 18 years previously diagnosed with ADHD. We conducted a cluster-randomized study of EHR-based decision support that included (1) clinical reminders to assess ADHD symptoms every 3 to 6 months and (2) an ADHD note template with structured fields for symptoms, treatment efficacy, and side effects. The key outcome measures were (1) the proportion of children with visits during the 6-month study period in which ADHD was assessed and (2) the quality of documentation of the ADHD assessment. Generalized estimating equations were used to control for clustering by providers. RESULTS: Children at intervention sites were more likely to have had a visit during the study period when their ADHD was being assessed. The ADHD template was used in 32% of visits where patients were specifically scheduled for ADHD assessment, and its use was associated with improved documentation of symptoms, treatment efficacy, and treatment side effects. CONCLUSIONS: EHR-based decision support improved the likelihood that children with ADHD had visits and care-related treatment for this condition. A better understanding of how to optimize provider use of decision support and templates could facilitate further improvements in care.",0,1,
695,Feedback on electronic health records to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections,"Aim: To study whether the Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Quality Dashboard, an electronic medical record (EHR)-based feedback system, has changed antibiotic prescribing. Study design: Cluster-randomized controlled study. Methods: We randomly assigned 27 primary care practices to receive the ARI Quality Dashboard or usual care. The primary outcome was the prescription rate of antibiotics for ARI visits. We also compared antibiotic prescribing between users and non-users of the ARI Quality Dashboard. Results: During the 9-month intervention, there was no difference between intervention and control practices in prescribing antibiotics for all ARI visits (47% vs = 0.68) or non-antibiotic-eligible ARI visits (38% vs 40%; P=0.70). Among the 258 interventional physicians, 72 (28%) used the ARI Quality Dashboard at least once a lower overall prescription rate of ARI antibiotics (42% vs. 50% for non-users; P=0.02). This difference was due to less antibiotic prescribing for non-antibiotic-eligible ARIs (32% vs. 43%; P=0.004). including nonstreptococcal pharyngitis (31% vs. 41%; P=0.01) and non-specific upper respiratory tract infections (19% vs. 34%; P=0.01) Conclusions: The ARI Quality Dashboard was not associated with an overall change in antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, although it has been associated with improved antibiotic prescribing when used. EHR-based quality reporting as part of 'wise use' m cannot improve care in the absence of other changes in primary care practice will. (Am J Manag Care. 2010;""16(12 Spec No.):e311-e319)",0,1,
696,Decision support based on electronic health records to improve asthma care: a cluster-randomized study.,"OBJECTIVE: Asthma remains one of the most common chronic childhood diseases, affecting _x0001_6 million children in the United States. Although there are guidelines from the National Asthma Education Prevention Program that are widely recognized, previous studies have shown low compliance by physicians across a wide range of populations. We wanted to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) embedded in an electronic health record (EHR) would improve clinical adherence to national asthma guidelines in primary care. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized study at 12 primary care sites over a 1-year period. Practices were stratified for analysis according to whether the location was urban or suburban. Children aged 0 to 18 years with persistent asthma were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision Codes for Asthma. The 6 intervention practice sites had CDS alerts embedded in the EHR. Findings of interest were the proportion of children with at least 1 prescription for control medication, a current asthma care plan, and use of outpatient spirometry. RESULTS: The increase in the number of controller drug prescriptions was 6% higher (P 0.006) and 3% higher for spirometry (P 0.04) over time in the urban interventional offices. Submission of a current asthma care plan improved 14% (P 0.03) and spirometry improved 6% (P 0.003) in the suburban practices with the intervention. CONCLUSION: In our study, which used a cluster-randomized study design, CDS in the EHR at the point-of-care improved physician adherence to National Asthma Education Prevention Program guidelines.

We evaluated the effectiveness of electronically delivered decision support tools in reducing antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections in primary care. METHODS General practices from England and Scotland participating in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were included in the study; 53 family practices were assigned to intervention and 51 practices to usual care. Patients aged 18 to 59 consulted for possible respiratory infections. The intervention was delivered through remotely installed, computer-aided decision support tools accessed during the consultations. Control practices represented usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of consultations for respiratory infections with an antibiotic prescribed based on electronic medical records. Shares specific to GPs were included in an analysis at cluster level. RESULTS Data were analyzed for 603,409 patients: 317,717 in intervention practices and 285,692 in control practices. The utilization of the intervention was lower than expected and varied between practices in the proportion of consultations with prescription antibiotics bed of 1.85% (95% CI, 0.10%-3.59%, P = 0.038) and in the prescription rate of antibiotics in respiratory infections (9.69%; 95% CI, 0.75%-18.63%, fewer prescriptions per 1,000 patient-years, P=0.034). There were no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Cluster-randomized trials can be efficiently implemented in large routine care samples using electronic medical records in primary care.

699,Electronic laboratory medicine ordering with evidence-based order sets in primary care (ELMO study): protocol for a cluster-randomized study,"Background Laboratory testing is an important clinical process with a valuable role in the screening, diagnosis, management, and monitoring of disease or therapy. However, inappropriate laboratory test orders are common, straining healthcare spending and negatively impacting the quality of care. Inappropriate testing can also lead to false positive results and potentially cause excessive downstream activities. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have shown promising results in influencing physician test ordering behavior and improving appropriateness. Order Sets, a form of CDSS that proposes a limited set of evidence-based tests for a range of indications integrated into a computerized physician order entry (CPOE), has been shown to be effective in reducing the volume of laboratory tests ordered, but is convincing evidence that they affect appropriateness is lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of prescription sets on the quality and quantity of laboratory test prescriptions by physicians. We also aim to assess the impact of job sets on diagnostic errors and examine the impact on downstream or cascaded activities. Methods We conduct a cluster-randomized controlled study in Belgian GP practices. The study is designed to measure two outcomes. We will primarily measure the impact of our CDSS on the adequacy of laboratory test orders. In addition, we also measure the impact on diagnostic errors. We will also examine the impact of our intervention on cascading activities due to altered outcomes of inappropriate testing. Discussion We designed a study to show whether CDSS aimed at diagnostic testing can not only affect adequacy, but is also safe from diagnostic errors. These findings will feed into a larger nationwide implementation of this CDSS. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02950142.",0,0,
700,Electronic health records to improve clinical management of tobacco dependence: a systematic review,"CONTEXT: The expanded use of electronic medical records (EMRs) may provide an opportunity to increase the use and impact of clinical guidelines to promote tobacco cessation treatment in primary care. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the evidence for such an effect. Evidence gathering: After a systematic search of the English-language literature on an EMR effect on either smoking cessation or clinical behavior, relevant articles were summarized and results from both observational studies and RCTs were summarized. Evidence Synthesis: Out of ten identified studies on EMRs and tobacco, only two RCTs were found. The addition of tobacco status as a vital sign led to an increase in some measures recommended by clinical guidelines, notably the documentation of smoking status. There was insufficient evidence to quantify the effect of EMR on changes in patients' smoking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: While the use of EMRs for prompting or feedback for clinical management of tobacco dependence shows some promising results, significant additional research is needed to understand the impact of EMRs on provider and patient behavior.",0,1,

METHODS Electronic case records and prescription tables (either electronic or paper) from 502 patients admitted to medical wards in a large Swiss teaching hospital between January 2009 and January 2010 were reviewed by four junior and four senior pharmacologists. Drug-related problems were identified and interventions suggested. The implementation and time delays of these proposed interventions were compared between the patients for whom paper medication cards were used and the patients for whom electronic medication cards were used. RESULTS From 109 hospital admissions, 158 drug-related problems were identified and 145 recommendations made, of which 51% were implemented. It was found that admissions with an electronic prescription card (n = 90) were 2.74 times more likely to implement the change than those with a paper prescription card (n = 53) (95% confidence interval 1.2, 6.3 , p=0.018, adjusted). for each dependency introduced by a patient, unit or clinical team"";"" follow-up for two missing cases).

702,"Electronically distributed, computer-generated, individualized feedback enhances the use of a computer-assisted practice guide","Clinical guidelines were developed to aid in the management of patient care"";"" However, these guidelines are often neglected in clinical practice. Computer-generated reminders improve policy usage, but these systems often fail to achieve high policy usage rates. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that computer-generated, individualized feedback regarding adherence to treatment guidelines will significantly improve clinical compliance with guideline recommendations presented through a computer-assisted treatment protocol. Half of the 45 primary care clinicians employed at a primary care clinic affiliated with an academic medical center were randomized to receive an email message every two weeks consisting of a computer generated report detailing their/ his reaction to the recommendations of the care guideline for the diabetics examined were summarized in the last 2 weeks. Clinical compliance with guideline recommendations was the primary endpoint. This study showed that the intervention significantly increased clinical compliance with guideline recommendations without incurring high maintenance costs. Median compliance in the intervention group was 35% versus 6.1% in the control group (p<0.01). Electronically distributed, computer-generated, individualized feedback on physician application of nursing guideline recommendations is an effective way to improve adherence to a nursing guideline.",0,1,
703,Email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals,"BACKGROUND: Email is one of the most widely used communication methods, but its use in healthcare is still uncommon. Where email communication has been used in healthcare, its purpose has included clinical communication between healthcare professionals, but the impact of using email in this way is unknown. We have updated a 2012 review on the use of email for two-way clinical communication between healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals on healthcare professional outcomes, patient outcomes, healthcare service performance, and service efficiency and acceptability compared to other forms of clinical information communication. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 9 2013), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1974 to August 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to August 2013) and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). We searched gray literature: theses/dissertations repositories, study registers and Google Scholar (search November 2013). We used additional search methods: checking reference lists and contacting authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time-series studies evaluating interventions in which healthcare professionals used email to deliver clinical information in the form of: 1) unsecured email, 2) more secure email, or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study inclusion, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and extracted data. We contacted the study authors for more information and reported all actions as per the study report. MAIN RESULTS: The previous version of this review included a randomized controlled trial with 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers at baseline. It compared an email to physicians containing patient-specific osteoporosis risk information and guidelines for assessment and treatment versus usual care (no email). This study had a high risk of bias in the assignment concealment and blinding domains. The email reminder significantly changed the actions of health care workers, as physicians were more likely to provide guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment (bone densitometry or osteoporosis medication, or both) compared to usual care. Evidence of its effects on patient behavior or actions was inconclusive. One measure found that the electronic medical reminder message had a positive effect on patient behavior (patients had higher calcium intake), and two found no difference between the two groups. The study did not assess health outcomes or harm. No new studies were identified for this update. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only one study was identified for inclusion, providing insufficient clinical practice evidence related to the use of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals. Future research should aim to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the latest advances in information technology, while considering the complexities of email as an intervention.",0,0,
704,Email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals,"BACKGROUND: E-mail is a popular and commonly used method of communication, but its use in healthcare is not routine. Where email communication has been used in healthcare, its purpose has included use for clinical communication between healthcare professionals, but the impact of using email in this way is unknown. This review evaluates the use of email for two-way clinical communication between healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of healthcare professionals using email to communicate clinical information on healthcare professional outcomes, patient outcomes, healthcare service performance, and service efficiency and acceptability compared to other forms of clinical information communication. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 2010), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1950 to January 2010), EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to January 2010), PsycINFO (1967 to January 2010), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (1982 to February 2010) and ERIC (CSA) (1965 to January 2010). We searched gray literature: theses/dissertations repositories, study registers and Google Scholar (search July 2010). We used additional search methods: reviewing bibliographies, contacting authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and discontinuous time-series studies investigating interventions in which healthcare professionals used email to communicate clinical information and did so in the form of 1) unsecured email 2) secure email or 3) web messaging. All healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers in all settings were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study inclusion, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and extracted data.

MAIN RESULTS: We included a randomized controlled trial with 327 patients and 159 healthcare providers at baseline. It compared an email to physicians containing patient-specific osteoporosis risk information and guidelines for assessment and treatment with due diligence (no email). This study had a high risk of bias in the assignment concealment and blinding domains. The email reminder significantly changed how healthcare professionals act, as physicians are more likely to administer guideline-recommended osteoporosis treatment (bone densitometry and/or osteoporosis medication) compared to usual care. Evidence of its effects on patient behavior/acts has been inconclusive. One measure found that the electronic medical reminder message had a positive impact on patient behavior: patients had higher calcium intake, and two found no difference between the two groups. The study did not assess the outcomes or harms of primary health care.

705,Emergency psychiatric care for self-harming refugees and asylum seekers,"This article describes the structure and function of emergency mental health care practice for self-harming refugees and asylum-seekers on temporary protection visas. Emergency nurses in accident and emergency rooms or as part of crisis intervention teams see self-harming refugees and asylum seekers on the brink of distress. This clinical paper is intended to support caregivers in their practice should they encounter an adult asylum seeker in need of emergency psychiatric care. Practical strategies are presented to help psychiatric nurses to assess, care for and comfort refugees and asylum seekers in this predicament. Where possible, mental health nurses should work closely with asylum seekers, their carers and accredited interpreters and translators to ensure appropriate language use when dealing with mental and emotional health issues, without further isolating the asylum seeker from appropriate services. To strengthen the continuity and integration of mental health support for refugees and asylum seekers, well-resourced care needs to be experienced as coherent and connected. A coherent, interdisciplinary and team-oriented approach will synthesize different points of view to shape clinical practice and create workable solutions in local situations.",0,0,
706,Empower patients or general practitioners? A randomized clinical trial to improve the quality of reproductive healthcare in Belgium,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical guidelines on contraceptive use have been developed and distributed to all Flemish General Practitioners (GPs) in Belgium. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies for implementing an oral contraceptive guideline to improve the quality of primary contraceptive advice in general practice, either by empowering patients or by introducing a computerized decision support system (CDSS). Method: A random sample of 45 general practitioners was divided into three study groups. One group was visited by an 'empowered patient', one group's electronic medical record was supplemented with a CDSS, and one group served as a control group. Simulated patients (SPs) evaluated the performance of general practitioners in daily practice before and after the procedures using a validated 48-item checklist. RESULTS: The baseline mean of the 43 general practitioners was 26.16 (SD = 5.76). The SPs received adequate information about taking the pills correctly, but not about factors related to pill failure and drug interactions. After the intervention, the mean value of the general practitioners was 26.39 (SD = 6.86). Only the intervention group with the “empowered patient” performed significantly better (29.92 [SD = 7.11]). The computer group and the control group performed worse (24.36 [SD = 6.60] and 24.82 [SD = 5.65], respectively). CONCLUSION: The development and dissemination of an evidence-based guideline has not changed the behavior of general practitioners. However, empowering patients to participate more proactively significantly improved primary care physician performance during contraception counseling. A CDSS does not.",0,0,
707,Encouraging post-stroke patients to be more active seems possible: Results of an intervention study with knowledge facilitators,"PURPOSE: Although physical activity and exercise are strongly recommended for stroke survivors for speedy recovery, patients in hospitals and rehabilitation centers are not sufficiently encouraged to be physically active. In this study, we examined the impact of knowledge facilitators (KBs), enterprising nurses, and therapists on health worker (HP) performance to encourage inpatient stroke survivors to engage in physical activity. METHOD: This multicenter intervention study used a pre-post test design. Two or three AIs were trained in each stroke unit of 12 hospitals and 10 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were filled out by patients and HPs before and after the AI intervention. The primary outcome was the HPs' encouragement to their patients to be physically active, as reported by patients and HPs. RESULTS: After the AI intervention, many more patients (48%; N=217) reported at least some encouragement from HPs to be physically active than before (26%; N=243, p<0.000). HPs (N=288) were, on average, more likely to report encouraging patients after the intervention, but this difference was only significant for occupational therapists and KBs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the patient reports of HP behavior, the AI intervention appears to be effective as more patients felt encouraged to be physically active after the intervention compared to before. Replication of this study in an experimental design is required to allow causal conclusions. Implications for Rehabilitation We advise rehabilitation teams to use knowledge brokers (KBs) because the KB intervention increases the perceived encouragement for physical activity by stroke patients. It makes sense to involve physicians, nurses and patients' relatives more often in efforts to encourage stroke patients to be physically active.",0,0,
708,Improved implementation of guidelines for back pain in general practice: study protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines can improve quality of care, but uptake of guideline recommendations is often incomplete and slow. New guidelines for back pain have recently been introduced in Denmark. The guidelines aim to reduce personal and public costs. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a complex, multifaceted implementation strategy of the low back pain guidelines reduces referral to secondary care and improves patient outcomes compared to the usual simple implementation strategy. METHODS/DESIGN: 100 general practices (clusters) and 2,700 patients aged 18 to 65 years from the region of Northern Denmark are included in a two-arm randomized cluster study. Practices are randomly assigned 1:1 to a simple or a complex implementation strategy. Intervention practices receive a complex implementation strategy, including guideline facilitator visits, stratification tools, and quality reports for treating low back pain. The primary outcome is referral to secondary care. Secondary endpoints are pain, physical functioning, health-related quality of life, patient satisfaction with care and treatment outcome, employment status, and sick leave. Primary and secondary results relate to the patient level. The assessment of the results is blinded and follows the intention-to-treat principle. In addition, a process assessment will assess the degree to which the intervention elements are being delivered as planned, as well as measure changes in beliefs and behaviors among primary care physicians and patients. DISCUSSION: This study provides knowledge about the process and impact of an intervention to implement guidelines for low back pain in general practice and will provide insight into key elements that should be included in future implementation strategies in general practice.

709,Improved physician adherence to antibiotic use guidelines through increased availability of guidelines at the time of drug ordering in the hospital.,"Purpose Some studies have shown that prescribing practice could be improved if practical guidelines are made available to physicians when making clinical decisions. The aim of the study was to assess the utility of the effects on physician adherence of the intervention, which consisted of embedding previously paper-based antibiotic guidelines into a teaching hospital's computerized drug prescription entry system, in order to make these guidelines available to physicians at the time the antibiotic order. Before the operation, these guidelines were available as a brochure on all wards of the hospital. Methods Adherence to guidelines was assessed for 471 consecutive antibiotic prescriptions for pneumonia, 104 immediately before and 367 immediately after the intervention. The evaluation criteria were: the choice of antibiotic in relation to the context of acquiring pneumonia, the daily dose, the planned duration of treatment. Antibiotic prescriptions were assessed at the start of antibiotic treatment. Results The intervention was followed by a significant decrease in the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions containing at least one criterion of nonconformity with guidelines, 33% after vs. 51% (p?<?0.001) before the intervention. Proportion of non-compliant orders in the post- vs. pre-intervention phase for the daily antibiotic dosage respectively 12.2% vs. 26.9% (p? <? 0.001), for the planned treatment duration 7.3% vs. 18, respectively .3% (p?<?0.001), while the improvement in the choice of antibiotic relative to the context of acquiring pneumonia did not reach statistical significance, 18.2% vs. 25% respectively (p?=?0.12). Conclusion In this study, the increased availability of antibiotic guidelines at the time of drug ordering, combined with regular rounds of reinforcement education, was associated with improved physician adherence to these guidelines.

710,Improving Access to Pharmacotherapy and Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders in Primary Care: ADaPT-PC,"Background Only 7.8% of individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment in any given year. Most individuals with AUDs are identified in primary care (PC) and referred to substance use disorder (SUD) clinics. However, only a minority of referred individuals participate in treatment services. There are safe and effective pharmacological treatments for AUD, but they are rarely prescribed by PC providers. The aim of this study is to refine, implement, and evaluate an intervention to integrate pharmacological AUD treatment options into PC settings. This paper contains a detailed description of the intervention design and the evaluation components. Methods/Design Three major Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities are participating in the intervention. The intervention targets stakeholders with tailored strategies based on implementation theory and previous research that identify barriers to implementing AUD pharmacotherapy. Local SUD providers and mental health integration (PCMHI) providers in primary care will be trained to act as local implementation/clinical champions and receive external support. PC providers gain access to advice from local and national clinical champions, educational materials and a dashboard from patients with AUD to their caseloads for case identification. Veterans with AUD diagnoses will receive intelligence information in the mail just before a scheduled PC visit. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed through an intermittent time series with matched controls to monitor the change in facility-level AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates. According to Stetler's four-phase formative evaluation (FE) strategy, FE methods include (1) development FE (pre-implementation interviews with champions, PC vendors and veterans), (2) implementation-oriented FE (tracking attendance at facilitation meetings, efforts to academic detailing through local champions and use of patient dashboard), (3) progression-oriented RD (tracking AUD pharmacotherapy prescription rates and referral rates to PCMHI and SUD specialty care), and (4) interpretive RD (post-implementation interviews with champions and PC -providers). Analysis of the FE data is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Discussion If proven successful, this implementation strategy will provide a reproducible, feasible, and relatively inexpensive method of integrating AUD treatment services into PC settings, thereby increasing access to AUD treatment.",0,0,
711,Improving evidence-based control of diabetes and chronic diseases in local health authorities: a multi-phase dissemination study with a randomized study component with step wedge clusters,"Background Diabetes and pre-diabetes rates are increasing in the United States, severely affecting the quality of life and life expectancy of those diagnosed and placing a financial burden on society. Premature death and disability can be prevented through the implementation of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs). Local Health Departments (LHDs) are uniquely positioned to implement EBPPs for diabetes control because they understand and focus on community-level needs, contexts and resources. However, there is a significant gap between the known diabetes control EBPPs and the actual diabetes control activities performed by LHDs. The purpose of this study is to determine how best to support the use of evidence-based public health for the control of diabetes (and related chronic diseases) by public health practitioners at the local level. Methods/Design This paper describes the methods for a two-phase, randomized, stepped-wedge cluster study that will evaluate dissemination strategies to increase uptake of public health knowledge and EBPPs for diabetes control among LHDs. Phase 1 includes the development of measures to assess practitioner views on and organizational support for evidence-based public health, data collection using an online national survey of chronic disease LHD practitioners, and a needs assessment of factors supporting the uptake of EBPPs for Diabetes control at LHDs affect within one state in the US. Phase 2 involves conducting a randomized step-wedge cluster study to evaluate the effectiveness of outreach strategies with practitioners at the local level in LHDs to improve capacity and organizational support for evidence-based diabetes prevention and control. Twelve LHDs will be selected and randomly assigned to one of three groups that deviate from standard practice to receive the intervention (dissemination) strategies at 8-month intervals”; The intervention duration for groups is 8 to 24 months. Intervention (dissemination) strategies may include multi-day face-to-face workshops, electronic information-sharing methods, technical support from a knowledge broker, and organizational changes to support evidence-based public health approaches. Assessment methods include surveys at baseline and at the three transition points, abstraction of program plans and progress reports on diabetes and chronic diseases at the local level, and social network analysis to understand the relationships and contextual issues affecting EBPP adoption.",0,1,
712,Improving referral for mammography in primary care,"Background. This 1-year, randomized study tested the effectiveness of behavioral techniques in increasing the number of primary care physician referrals for mammography in small group practices. METHODS: Sixty-one practices were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) education control only, (2) education plus cue enhancement with mammography chart stickers, and (3) education plus cue enhancement plus feedback and token rewards. Quarterly desk reviews of a defined sample (N = 11,716) of female patients aged 50 years and older were conducted to document mammography referrals, completion, and compliance. Results. Referral and completion rates increased from baseline through Q1 and then gradually declined thereafter. Overall, these rates were higher in the cuing condition than in the control condition. In contrast, compliance rates in both experimental conditions increased over the year while remaining static in the control condition, showing a strong and persistent effect for cue improvement. The increases in compliance were greatest among older non-white physicians with a second specialty, in single practice, without members of the AMA, without residency training, and without board certification. Conclusions. Chart stickers can significantly increase the use of mammography in small group practices. These practices are an efficient way to reach large numbers of older women who need mammography screening.",1,1,
713,Strengthening of the African Bioethics Initiative,"BACKGROUND: Medical ethics has existed since Hippocrates. However, formal training in bioethics only became established a few decades ago. Bioethics has gained a firm place in the health sciences in developed countries, particularly in Europe and North America. The situation is very different in many developing countries. Bioethics, as established and practiced in the West today, does not exist in most African countries or only exists in a rudimentary form. DISCUSSION: Although bioethics has come of age in developed and some developing countries, it is still largely 'alien' to most African countries. A number of bioethics conferences have been held in some parts of Africa over the past decade to raise awareness of research ethics and ensure conformance with international guidelines for research involving human participants. This idea arose in recognition of the real need to develop research ethics review capacities in Africa. It is also a condition required by external sponsors of collaborative research in Africa. The awareness and interest generated by these conferences needs to be further strengthened and extended beyond research ethics to clinical practice. Broadly speaking, bioethics education in schools that train physicians and other healthcare providers is the hook that enshrines both research ethics and clinical ethics. SUMMARY: This communication provides an overview of the current situation of bioethics in Africa in relation to research ethics workshops and suggests that despite current efforts to integrate ethics into biomedical research in Africa, much remains to be done to do so reach. A more comprehensive approach to bioethics with overarching benefits is to integrate formal ethics education into health education institutions in Africa.",0,0,
714,Improving the algorithm for developmental behavior monitoring and screening in children aged 0-5 years,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the American Academy of Pediatrics' 2006 developmental monitoring and screening algorithm is appropriate or whether revisions are needed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to assess a clinician's ability to conduct developmental and behavioral monitoring in children aged 0 to 5 years. RESULTS: Although broad-spectrum developmental screening is typical, pediatricians should refer when they confidently suspect a delay but be much more suspicious of children who appear asymptomatic. Regular screening improves surveillance by improving early detection and early intervention (EI) eligibility rates. Still, children with worrying screens are not consistently referred to EI and connected to each other. After referral, approximately half are considered EI ineligible, although they typically underperform significantly and have numerous, predictive academic and psychosocial risk factors. Meanwhile, clinicians are struggling to track down children at risk. CONCLUSION: Revisions are needed to streamline early detection, prevention, and surveillance. Greater emphasis needs to be placed on encouraging developmental behavior and coordinating referral provision.",0,0,
715,Improving the quality of antibiotic prescribing in primary care: qualitative evaluation of a blended learning intervention,"BACKGROUND: The Stemming the Tide of Antibiotic Resistance (STAR) educational program aims to improve the quality of antibiotic prescribing and raise awareness of antibiotic resistance among general practitioners. It consists of a seven-part, theory-based, blended learning program that includes online reflections on clinicians' own practice, presentation of research and guidelines, a practice-based seminar focusing on participants' own antibiotic prescribing, and resistance rates in urine samples from their practice , communication training with videos of simulated patients in routine operations and participation in a web forum. Efficacy was assessed in a randomized controlled trial involving 244 home health nurses and 68 general practices. This paper reports part of the process evaluation of this study. Methods: Semi-structured, digitally recorded and transcribed telephone interviews with 31 specifically selected study participants, who were evaluated using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported increased awareness of antibiotic resistance, greater confidence in reducing antibiotic prescribing, and at least some change in counseling style and antibiotic prescribing behavior. Reported practical changes included the adoption of a practice-wide policy to reduce antibiotic prescribing. Many GPs also reported better insight into patient expectations, ultimately contributing to an improved doctor-patient relationship. The components of the intervention that have the greatest impact on changing clinical behavior were up-to-date research resources, simple and effective communication skills presented in online videos, and the presentation of real-world antibiotic prescription levels combined with a review of local resistance data . CONCLUSION: Participants considered this complex blended learning intervention acceptable and feasible and reported widespread, positive changes in attitude and clinical practice as a result of participation in the STAR educational program.

717,"Epidemiology of presenile dementia from Alzheimer's in Scotland, 1974-88","OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiology of presenile Alzheimer's disease in Scotland from 1974 to 1988. DESIGN To retrospectively review the hospital records of patients less than 73 years of age admitted to psychiatric hospitals with various diagnoses of dementia. Diagnoses were classified using the National Institute for Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria and the Hachinski score. The completeness of the study sample was assessed by reviewing the neurological outpatient and general hospital records. RECRUITMENT All general psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS All patients with incipient dementia aged 40-64. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Probable and prevalent Alzheimer's disease, patient gender, age at onset. RESULTS 5874 records from psychiatric hospitals, 129 records from neurological outpatient departments and 89 records from non-psychiatric hospitals were examined. 317 patients met criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease, 569 met criteria for broad Alzheimer's disease, and 267 met criteria for multi-infarct dementia. The minimum incidences per 100,000 population aged 40 to 64 were 22.6 (95% confidence interval, 20.2 to 25.2) and 40.5 (38.9 to 42.3) per 100,000 for the probable and broad Alzheimer's disease. In the 1981 census year, the annual incidence of probable Alzheimer's disease was 1.6 (1.0 to 2.6). Women were at higher risk with incidence rates for probable Alzheimer's disease of 28.2 (24.5 to 32.4) per 100,000 compared to 16.5 (13.8 to 19.8) per 100,000 in men. The incidence per 100,000 for multi-infarct dementia was higher in men (25.1, 23.3 to 27.1) than in women (13.4, 12.1 to 14.8). CONCLUSION Female gender appears to be positively associated with developing Alzheimer's disease before the age of 65 years.",0,0,

720,ESHRE guideline: Routine psychosocial support for infertility and medically assisted reproduction - a guide for fertility workers,"STUDY QUESTION: Based on the best available evidence in the literature, what is the optimal management of routine psychosocial care in infertility and medically assisted reproductive (MAR) clinics? SUMMARY ANSWER: Using the structured methodology of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) Guideline Development Manual, 120 recommendations were formulated that answered the 12 key questions on how best to manage routine psychosocial care by all fertility workers. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: The 2002 ESHRE Guidelines for Infertility Counseling have been a reference point for the best infertility mental health care for years, but this guideline needed updating and did not focus on routine mental health care provided by all fertility workers can. STUDY, DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This guideline was developed by a group of experts in the field according to the 12-step process outlined in the ESHRE guideline development guide. After defining the scope of the guideline and listing a set of 12 key questions in PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome) format, a thorough systematic literature review was conducted"";"" Evidence from papers published up to April 2014 was collected, assessed for quality and analyzed. In response to each of the key questions, a summary of the evidence was written, which served as the basis for recommendations defined by consensus within the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Patient and additional clinical input was collected during the scoping and review phase of guideline development. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The guideline panel, consisting of psychologists, two physicians, a midwife, a patient advocate and a methodology expert, met three times to discuss evidence and reach consensus on the recommendations. KEY FINDINGS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE THE GUIDELINE OFFERS: 120 recommendations aimed at guiding fertility clinic staff in providing optimal evidence-based routine psychosocial care for patients with infertility and MAR. The policy is divided into two sections. The first section describes patients' preferences regarding the psychosocial care they would like to receive in clinics and how this care relates to their well-being. The second section of the guideline provides information on the psychosocial needs of patients throughout their treatment course (before, during and after treatment) and how fertility clinic staff can identify and address them. Needs refer to conditions that are believed to be necessary for patients to have a healthy experience of fertility treatment. Needs can be behavioral (lifestyle, exercise, diet, and compliance), relational (relationship with partner, if any, family, friends, and larger network and work), emotional (well-being, e.g., anxiety, depression, and quality of life), and cognitive (treatment concerns). and know). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We have identified many areas of nursing where robust evidence is lacking. Evidence gaps have been filled by formulating good practice points based on GDG expert opinion, but it is crucial that such recommendations are empirically validated. SUBSEQUENT IMPLICATIONS OF RESULTS: The evidence presented in this guideline demonstrates that the provision of routine mental health care is associated with, or has the potential to reduce, stress and concerns about medical procedures, and the outcomes of lifestyle, knowledge about To improve fertility, patient well-being and treatment adherence. Because only 45 (36.0%) of the 125 recommendations were based on high-quality evidence, the guideline group made recommendations for future research aimed at expanding the evidence base.",0,0,
721,Essential elements of an early intervention service for psychosis: the opinions of experienced clinicians,"BACKGROUND: Early intervention teams attempt to improve outcome in schizophrenia through earlier detection and the provision of phase-specific treatments. As the number of early intervention teams grows, there is a lack of clarity about their essential structural and functional elements. METHODS: A 'Delphi' exercise was conducted to determine the degree of consensus on the essential elements of early intervention teams in a group of 21 UK specialist physicians. Using published guidelines, an initial list was created containing 151 items across ten categories of team structure and function. RESULTS: Overall, there was expert consensus on the importance of 136 (90%) of these items. Of the items for which there was consensus, 106 (70.2%) were rated as essential, meaning that without them the team's ability to function would be severely impaired. CONCLUSION: This level of consensus on key elements suggests that it is reasonable to define a model for UK early intervention teams from which a measure of accuracy could be derived.",0,0,
722,Fundamentals of research ethics for healthcare professionals,"Whether conducted in a university setting or in the healthcare setting, research involving humans raises a variety of ethical issues for healthcare professionals. In the ongoing professional development of ethical research methods, both clinicians and researchers need to expand their knowledge to obtain answers to the following questions: Which ethical theories serve as a basis for ethical principles in research ethics? What ethical principles should a researcher respect when conducting research involving human subjects? What does it mean to conduct ethical research? What ethical dilemmas does a researcher face when conducting research? This paper provides an overview of ethical theories and the ethical basis of guidelines developed and used to guide research involving humans. Ethical behavior and the personal responsibility of the researcher conducting research involving humans are discussed along with ethical considerations in research designs and methods.",0,0,
723,Establishing collaborations in translational and clinical cancer research between high- and low-income countries,"Both infectious and non-infectious malignancies are a growing problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is difficult to extrapolate cancer treatment data and guidelines from high-income countries (HIC) to cancer patients in LMIC. With noncommunicable cancer rates rising, there is a growing gap between the need for evidence-based treatments for cancer control plans and existing research capacities. Surgeons often provide all surgical and medical oncology treatments to patients in LMIC for diseases such as breast, gastric, cervical, and colon cancer. However, clinical and translational research collaborations in surgical oncology are lacking. There are several successful consortia that focus on HIV and infection-related malignancies. These collaborations can serve as an example for future surgical research efforts. The collaboration between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Nigeria, focused on colon cancer, is used as an example of how to initiate a research collaboration that can build research infrastructure and provide the necessary data to create realistic treatment guidelines. The need for expanded surgical oncology research and the growing population of patients with non-infectious malignancies at the LMIC has created a unique opportunity for surgeons to initiate and lead clinical and translational research collaborations between the HIC and the LMIC.",0,0,

725,Ethical and Institutional Review Board Questions,"IRBs play an important role in protecting research subjects/patients. As healthcare professionals, researchers have an inherent potential conflict of interest"";"" As physicians, they are dedicated to promoting the well-being of individual patients, while as researchers, they seek knowledge that can be generalized and applicable to people other than the individual patient being studied. The second goal may conflict with the first. IRBs have a primary responsibility to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects. Although the IRB system is not perfect, conscientious IRBs assure the public that the rights and welfare of human subjects are given serious consideration by those who have no vested interest in the outcome of the research. By discharging their responsibilities, IRBs promote the protection of human subjects. IRB approval represents a significant endorsement of the scientific and ethical quality of the research and therefore provides important validation for research and research researchers. IRBs, acting in accordance with the guiding principles of the Belmont Report and within the regulatory guidelines of 45.CFR.46, are intended to strike a balance between the societal interest in advancing scientific knowledge and the mandate to protect the rights and well-being of human subjects.",0,0,
726,Ethical and legal risks of archival research,"Psychiatric facilities and practitioners typically allow researchers direct access to patient records for archival research purposes without the informed consent of patient participants. Typically, these researchers have access to any information in such records so long as they agree to maintain confidentiality and remove any identifying data from subsequent research reports. Changes in the American Psychological Association's Code of Ethics (American Psychological Association, 1992) raise ethical and legal issues that need to be considered by practitioners, researchers, and the institution's institutional review boards. This article addresses these issues and provides recommendations for changes in ethical standards and alternative ways of conducting research using archived mental health records.",0,0,
727,Ethical complications of clinical therapeutic research in children,"The usual discussion by ethicists and physicians about the ethical implications of research into children with catastrophic diseases and the guidelines established by the federal government for that research is based on the application of general moral principles to problems. Whatever the merits of this approach to policy-making, it does not adequately reflect the life situation of patients and the complexity of a single regimen that is both therapeutic and research-oriented at the same time. The problems also become more complex when parents disagree about the course of treatment. We believe that such cases are properly resolved by considering the degree of paternalism that the clinician-researcher must exercise."";"" KIE: Much of the discussion of ethical issues in therapeutic research involving children is based on the application of general moral principles to problem categories. The authors believe that this approach does not adequately reflect the complexity of a treatment regimen that is both therapeutic and research-oriented for catastrophically ill children. Using a case study to illustrate the possible complications of such a situation, they argue that medical paternalism is justified in therapeutic research on children even when it compromises the patient's autonomy, since the patient's well-being must prevail over the preservation of the child's fullness Autonomy.",0,0,

729,Ethical considerations in recruiting study participants from hospitalized cardiovascular patient populations,"Cardiovascular research nurses play an important role in ensuring that subject recruitment is conducted in an ethical manner. However, as research progresses, these caregivers encounter many ethical challenges. Sole reliance on regulatory mechanisms such as oversight by institutional review boards and compliance with legal requirements does not necessarily ensure the protection of human subjects or the scientific integrity of researchers (J Law Med Ethics. 2002"";""30:411-419). Therefore, this article discusses 3 additional ethical considerations related to the recruitment of hospitalized cardiovascular patients for research studies. These include (a) the role of family and patient-delegated gatekeepers, (b) the impact of transient and subtle changes in mental status on the consent process, and (c) the impact of conflicting patient priorities. This content is illustrated through the authors' experiences in recruiting patients undergoing in-hospital coronary artery bypass graft surgery for a research study.",0,0,

732,Ethical issues in the management of chronic non-malignant pain,"Chronic pain presents a challenge for patients, families, employers and the doctors who care for these individuals. Opioids remain the mainstay of analgesic drugs for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. Controlled-release preparations of morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, and long-acting opioids such as methadone and levorphanol are medically and ethically accepted in the management of chronic cancer pain. However, the continued use of these drugs in patients with chronic non-cancer pain has been hotly debated. This article attempts to reconcile the medical and ethical dilemmas of using opioid medications for chronic non-cancer pain. Increasing clinical experience in the field of pain medicine has helped to clarify: (1) the misconception of addiction, physical dependence, and analgesic tolerance, (2) the misconception that chronic opioid therapy inevitably causes personality changes, depression, and impairment of cognitive and physical function , (3) the lack of information on the correct use of opioid analgesics with regard to titration and the management of associated side effects. The behavioral management of pain patients undergoing chronic opioid therapy is also discussed. A protocol for optimal patient management is proposed. Particular attention is paid to the form of consent, behavioral agreements and the consequences of non-compliance. It emphasizes the importance of psychological assessment prior to long-term opioid trials to minimize future complications. Although most patients do well on opioid therapy, special attention needs to be paid to patients with current addiction, a history of addiction, or current abuse of opioid drugs. In patients with significant behavioral problems, pharmacological and conservative interventions are often warranted. When such strategies fail and chronic opioid therapy is deemed necessary, some treatment guidelines are offered.",0,0,
733,Ethical rules for innovative surgery: the final frontier?,"BACKGROUND: There are no clear federal regulations for innovative surgery, although general guidelines for human research do exist. We hypothesized that US surgeons are unaware of Department of Health regulations, rarely seek IRB review, are generally resistant to external regulation of innovative surgery, and are uncertain about what constitutes innovation and research. These circumstances, if true, would pose a significant ethical problem and potentially harm patients as ignorant research subjects. STUDY DESIGN: In a pilot study, we reviewed 527 issues of US surgical and medical journals and selected 59 articles published between 1992 and 2000 that described innovative surgery. Corresponding authors from university hospitals (71%) and other institutions (29%) received an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: The survey was conducted between November 2000 and May 2001. Twenty-one completed questionnaires were returned, representing an overall response rate of 35%. Fourteen authors confirmed that their work was research, but only six had requested prior review by the IRB. The majority of authors (15 out of 21) did not submit their protocol to the IRB. Only seven authors had mentioned the innovative nature of the procedure in the informed consent form. Seven authors reported being familiar with the Office for Human Research Protections definitions of research and human subject. Two-thirds of respondents indicated that government regulations protecting human subjects undergoing innovative surgery are not adequate. CONCLUSIONS: The current system of definitions, ethical theories, and voluntary professional guidelines may not be sufficient to meet the challenge of surgical innovation. Further research is proposed to assess the adequacy of existing guidance.",0,0,
734,Ethical requirements that must be met before introducing new processes,"In order for the orthopedic care of patients to continue to improve, new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches must be constantly developed. In order to verify that a new approach actually delivers better results, these innovations must be subjected to rigorous scientific investigations. However, since the results of clinical interventions can only be examined in humans, these studies must not only meet scientific criteria, but also strict ethical criteria. The Declaration of Helsinki, a World Medical Association document originally drafted in 1964, revised substantially in 1975 and last revised in 1996, provides guidelines for such studies. In addition to meeting ethical requirements, clinical investigators are also faced with various complex issues that need to be addressed when conducting clinical research studies. One of the most difficult issues is the conflict between a physician's concern for the well-being of their patients and the need for protocol-driven studies. No matter how excited surgeons may be about a new therapeutic approach, they must recognize that they have a responsibility to scientifically validate their innovative approach with a well-controlled clinical trial using valid functional outcome measures.",0,0,
735,Ethical review of proposals to evaluate health promotion programs,"Some guidelines state that program evaluation falls within the scope of administrative research that does not require review by an ethics committee. We suggest that some evaluations of health promotion programs include at least one research element and can be distinguished from quality assurance. Although American and Canadian evaluation societies provide important guidelines and standards for evaluation practitioners, processes for public accountability are provided by research ethics committees. The field of health promotion is inherently fraught with challenges for existing research ethics committees. Given the paucity of published literature on the ethics of evaluation or health promotion practice, the area could benefit from the open debate encouraged by reviews of proposals.",0,0,
736,ethics committees and the achievement of good clinical practice,"Local ethics committees (Institutional Review Boards or similar bodies) have been established at (bio)medical research institutions worldwide over the last few decades to act as review boards of proposed research projects (including clinical trial protocols) and also to monitor whether the ethical principles, including the Good practice requirements (clinical, laboratory and scientific) are respected and fulfilled when conducting research projects. The existing pluralism of the philosophical background on which contemporary theories of bioethics are developed seriously challenges the ancient traditions of Hippocratic, non-utilitarian medical ethics and seeks to promote more utilitarian and secular approaches. Individual physicians or researchers, as well as the ethics committee itself, are today confronted with complicated ethical dilemmas, which often have to be resolved in an atmosphere of considerable social, collegial, economic and time pressures, and sometimes without helpful guidance and adequate legislation. An interesting way to overcome some of the pitfalls of the ethics review process is to establish shared ethical responsibility for the research project or study protocol in a statement by most (or all) of the parties involved (e.g. ethics committee, patient, ""society""). Such an approach has proved helpful to improve the concrete deliberations of the ethics committees established in Slovakia since 1991 according to the requirements of the national guidelines issued by the Slovak Ministry of Health.",0,0,
737,Ethics committees and pediatric research: a personal perspective,"The monitoring of clinical research involving children or tissue removed from them is becoming more formalized and sophisticated. It can be assumed that many physicians and most paediatricians will be offered the opportunity to serve on pediatric institutional ethics committees (IECs) at some stage in their careers. Fearless and independent ethics committees have significant influence on both the design and conduct of clinical research and the subjects of valid research involving infants and children. The composition of IECs is generally intended to provide a balance of gender, professional background, and institutional and non-institutional affiliations. In addition to these now well-established compositional guidelines, IECs making decisions about pediatric research have a pragmatic requirement for three additional specific roles: that of in loco parentis, in loco infanti, and the special role of nursing staff. These roles and the ethical basis for them are defined. Furthermore, the role of in loco parentis is ethnically complex and an IEC considering this role should be aware of its implications. Pediatric research projects involve not only specific risks inherent in the project concerned, but also more general risks inherent in any clinical research project itself. Pediatric IECs should act in a manner of encouragement rather than just 'physician observers' and should insist from the outset on the publication of results as a condition of permission to conduct the research in question. A particularly effective form of ethical review is the national and international peer review that follows such publication of pediatric research. This report discusses these specific issues in the evolving context of increased surveillance of pediatric research.",0,0,
738,Ethics committees in Italy: a survey of oncologists,"OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: The mission of physicians and the purpose of clinical research can lead to a conflict between medical ethics and human rights. All recommendations, guidelines, and laws regarding experimental interventions require a formal protocol, approval by an ethics committee (EC), and written informed consent from potential participants. In Italy, new guidelines on handling submissions to EC were published in 1998. A year later, there was a feeling among those involved in EC activities that the new rules (i.e. decentralization and emphasis on pharmacological aspects of the studies) would have an immediate negative impact. A prospective study was launched to evaluate oncologists' opinions on the functioning of the Italian EG. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A questionnaire was distributed twice to 110 oncologists participating in two multicenter studies. Nine questions were included on the following aspects: existence of an EC at the hospital level, personal experience of an EC, average time taken to evaluate submitted proposals, and level of satisfaction with key functions of the EC. RESULTS: Responses were received from 93 (first survey) and 69 (second survey) physicians. In both surveys, clinicians indicated that they were satisfied with the scientific and ethical aspects of the EC function but dissatisfied with the educational activities and training, and the bureaucratic and bureaucratic requirements. In the second survey, the average time required for the evaluation after submission of a study protocol was about 2.4 months and dissatisfaction was still high for some critical aspects such as bureaucracy (44%) and educational activities and training (64%). . The analysis of the change over time documented small differences (from -8% to +7%) in all assessed aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the present study, i.e. the small sample size and the intrinsic characteristics of the Italian environment, the results add empirical evidence regarding the functioning of the local EC and the opinions of clinical researchers. This experience confirms that empirical studies of medical ethics are feasible and can provide useful information to facilitate the implementation of EC in the medical and lay community.",0,0,
739,"Ethics of Innovative Surgery: Definitions, Knowledge, and Attitudes of US Surgeons","BACKGROUND: Innovative surgery is not clearly defined, nor is it formally regulated by governing bodies, as is the case with drug and medical device development. This unclear status and the associated questionable applicability of existing federal guidelines for human research give rise to ethical concerns. To clarify his position, we asked US surgeons for definitions, opinions and attitudes towards innovative surgery. Surgeons were also invited to share their knowledge of the current federal regulations governing human research and the rules for informed consent and IRB review of clinical research itself. STUDY DESIGN: A group of US surgeons received a 46-item questionnaire addressing the definition of innovative surgery versus research and practice, human research regulations, the need for specific informed consent, and the IRB review of surgical innovations. RESULTS: A total of 665 responses were included in the content analysis. Respondents expressed a rather cautious attitude when assessing hypothetical innovative scenarios. Characteristics of experimentation and clinical research as modes of innovation have been more clearly defined for the surgical situation. CONCLUSIONS: There are defining criteria that lead to additional consideration and prior review of surgical innovations. Some forms of innovation clearly fall within current human research regulations"";"" others may not fully meet the definition but may require additional monitoring.",0,0,

Rather, the analysis should take into account the four ethical principles – respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, charity and justice – in their validity for all groups of people concerned. We present the ethical benefits and costs of current practice of randomized clinical trials for four groups: patients enrolled in clinical trials, patients not enrolled in trials, participating physicians, and society. Then, the ALARA approach (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) is presented and practical measures are suggested to achieve a positive balance between ethical benefits and costs of randomized trials.",0,0,

Research differs from ordinary clinical practice in its intent to advance knowledge. So defined, research with psychiatric patients should be governed by the same four principles as research with any other group—knowledge, necessity, utility, and consent. However, in applying these principles, particularly the consent principle, psychiatric patients encounter many acute difficulties. A number of proposals to solve these difficulties are discussed. It should be noted that notwithstanding the value of published guidelines and the assistance that may be available from research ethics committees, the primary responsibility for maintaining high standards of research practice rests with the researchers themselves.",0,0,
743,"EUROASPIRE III: a survey on lifestyle, risk factors and use of cardioprotective drug therapies in coronary patients from 22 European countries","OBJECTIVE: The aim of the European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events III (EUROASPIRE III) Survey was to determine whether the Joint European Societies guidelines on cardiovascular prevention are followed in everyday clinical practice and to describe lifestyle, risk factor and therapeutic factors Management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Europe. METHODS: The EUROASPIRE III survey was conducted in 2006-2007 in 76 centers from selected geographical areas in 22 countries in Europe. Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of CHD were identified retrospectively and then followed up, interviewed and examined at least 6 months after their coronary event. RESULTS: Thirteen thousand nine hundred and thirty-five medical records (27% women) were reviewed and 8966 patients were interviewed. When surveyed, 17% of patients smoked cigarettes, 35% were obese and 53% were centrally obese, 56% had blood pressure > or = 140/90 mmHg (> or = 130/80 in people with diabetes mellitus), 51% had a Total serum cholesterol > or = 4.5 mmol/L and 25% reported a history of diabetes, of which 10% had a fasting plasma glucose value of less than 6.1 mmol/L and 35% had a glycated hemoglobin A1c value of less than 6.5%. The use of cardioprotective drugs was: antiplatelet drugs 91%; beta blockers 80%; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 71%;“ calcium channel blockers 25% and statins 78%. CONCLUSION: The EUROASPIRE III survey shows that a majority of coronary patients are not meeting the lifestyle, risk factors and therapeutic goals for cardiovascular disease prevention. There are large differences between countries in the prevalence of risk factors and the use of cardioprotective drug therapies. There is still significant potential across Europe to improve standards of preventive care to reduce the risk of recurrent disease and death in patients with CHD.",0,0,

A total of 16,426 medical records were viewed and 7,998 patients (24.4% women) were interviewed. At the time of the survey, 16.0% of the patients smoked cigarettes and 48.6% of the smokers at the time of the event were regular smokers. 59.9% reported little or no physical activity; 37.6% were obese (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)) and 58.2% centrally obese (waist circumference >/= 102 cm for males or >/= 88 cm). in women); 42.7% had blood pressure >/= 140/90 mmHg (>/= 140/80 in diabetics); 80.5% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >/= 1.8 mmol/L and 26.8% reported having diabetes Cardioprotective medication was: antiplatelet agents 93.8%, beta-blockers 82.6%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers 75.1%;” and statins 85.7%. 50.7% of patients were recommended to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, and 81.3% of recommended patients attended at least half of the sessions. CONCLUSION: A large majority of coronary patients do not meet guideline standards for secondary prevention with high prevalences of persistent smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and consequently most patients are overweight or obese with a high prevalence of diabetes. Risk factor control is inadequate, despite the commonly reported use of medication, and there are large differences in secondary prevention practice between centers. Less than half of coronary patients participate in cardiac prevention and rehabilitation programs. All coronary and vascular patients require a modern preventive cardiology program, appropriately adapted to the medical and cultural context of each country, to achieve a healthier lifestyle, better control of risk factors and adherence to cardioprotective medications.",0,0,
745,Evaluation of an educational activity to improve asthma management in four European countries. Drug education project group,"In the international Drug Education Project, a new training program for peer groups of doctors was developed and tested to improve the treatment of asthma patients in the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Slovakia. Individual feedback on the prescription and the underlying decision-making strategy was presented and discussed within the physician group in relation to existing guidelines. In a parallel, randomized, controlled design, the effect on competence and actual prescription was tested. The results were linked to national guidelines. In general, the program improved doctors' attitudes and some of their prescribing behavior. The proportion of patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids improved significantly in the Netherlands (effect size 1.27) and the proportion of patients using oral corticosteroids for exacerbation treatment increased in both the Netherlands and Norway (effect sizes 1.99 and 0 ,87). The general attitude of Dutch and Norwegian physicians also improved significantly (effect size 1.06 and 0.87, respectively), as did both knowledge (effect size 1.06) and attitude (effect size 1.49) towards exacerbation treatment in Slovakia . No significant improvements could be measured in Sweden. In conclusion, improvements in asthma management are possible with an educational program based on self-learning in small peer groups, although the impact in one healthcare setting may not be apparent in another healthcare setting. Possible explanatory factors may include different attitudes and experiences with guidelines and continuing medical education programs and differences in the possibilities for change, including prevailing trends in prescribing behaviour.",0,0,
746,"Evaluation of computer science applications - some alternative approaches: theory, social interactionism and the demand for methodological pluralism","review of the review literature on CDSSs shows that randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are the ""gold standard"" for review. While this approach is excellent for studying system or clinical performance, it is not well suited to answering questions about whether systems are being used or how they are being used. As underutilization of CDSS has been a concern for a number of years, other evaluation research designs are needed to address these issues. This paper critiques RCT and experimental assessment approaches and presents alternative assessment approaches that address questions that fall outside the scope of usual RCT and experimental designs. A wide range of literature is summarized to illustrate the value of evaluations that take into account social, organizational, professional, and other contextual considerations. Many of these studies go beyond standard measures of system performance or physician behavior by focusing on the system's ""fit"" with other aspects of professional and organizational life. Since there are few explicit theories informing many evaluations, the paper then reviews CDSS evaluations based on social science theories. Finally, it proposes a theoretical social science basis for social interactionism. An example of such an approach is given. It includes a CDSS in Psychiatry and is based on Kaplan's 4Cs, which focus on communication, control, care and context. Although the example is a CDSS, the scoring approach is also useful for clinical guideline implementation and other medical informatics applications. Similarly, while the discussion revolves around social interactionism, the more important point is the need to broaden evaluation through a variety of methods and approaches that examine social, cultural, organizational, cognitive, and other contextual concerns. Methodological pluralism and a variety of research questions can improve the understanding of many influences on the development and use of computer science applications.",0,0,
747,"Evaluation of the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention in increasing the clinical delivery of preventive care in a network of community-based mental health services: a study protocol of a multi-baseline, non-randomized trial","BACKGROUND: People with mental illness suffer significant health disparities, including increased rates of morbidity and mortality caused by potentially preventable chronic diseases. One factor contributing to such inequality is a higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviors such as smoking, insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol consumption, and insufficient physical activity. Evidence supports the effectiveness of screening in reducing such risks, and guidelines recommend that screening to manage such risks be integrated into routine clinical care. Although community-based mental health services represent an important potential environment to ensure that people living with a mental illness receive such care, research suggests that their delivery is currently suboptimal. A study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention in improving the routine delivery of preventive care by clinicians in community mental health settings. METHODS/DESIGN: A two-group multiple baseline design is used to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention implemented over 12 months to improve the clinical offer of preventive care. The intervention will be delivered sequentially in the two groups of community mental health services to improve the delivery of client assessments, brief counseling, and referrals for four unhealthy behaviors (smoking, insufficient fruit and vegetable consumption, harmful alcohol use, and insufficient physical activity). . Outcome measures of interest are collected via repeated cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted weekly for 36 months with mental health patients in the community. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-strategic clinical practice change intervention in improving the routine clinical delivery of preventive care for behavioral risk factors of chronic disease within a network of community mental health services. Findings will inform future policy and practice regarding the ability of clinicians in mental health settings to improve the delivery of preventive care as a result of such interventions.

The primary goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of approaches to delirium clarification. A detailed search of educational and medical databases was conducted. The type of intervention used was classified according to Green and colleagues' PRECEED model using factors relevant to behavior change in health promotion. The effectiveness of the intervention was determined by assessing changes in staff performance and patient outcomes. Nineteen studies of variable design and quality were identified. Studies that used predisposing, enabling, and reinforcement strategies together were more likely to be effective in inducing changes in staff behavior and patient outcomes. Education and policies used together or in combination have little effect. When strategies to enable and reinforce changes in clinical practice are used in conjunction with educational sessions, patient outcomes are more positive.",0,0,
749,Evaluation of the Stage-of-Change Model for a Cervical Cancer Screening Intervention in Appalachian Women of Ohio,"Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately high among women living in Appalachia, Ohio. This study used the transtheoretical model to examine screening barriers before and after a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention (2005-2009) to increase screening rates for cervical cancer. Appalachian women in Ohio (n=90) requiring a Pap test were randomized to a 10-month LHA intervention based on risk-appropriate guidelines and received two in-person visits, two phone calls, and four targeted postcards in the mail at the change phase of the participant. Results showed that 63% had stage progression 10 months post-procedure. The most commonly reported barriers to screening were time constraints, missed appointments, and cost. Women who reported the following barriers: physician did not recommend the test; cannot afford the test; and embarrassment, nervousness, or anxiety about a Pap test—were less likely to be in the action phase. Understanding the stages of change associated with Pap testing and reported barriers in this underserved population can help inform researchers and clinicians about this population's readiness for change and the setting of realistic intervention goals.",0,0,
750,Assessing the uptake and impact of the computerized decision support system NHGDoc on the quality of primary care: Protocol for a large-scale randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Computer-aided decision support systems (CDSSs) are increasingly used to improve the quality of care. There is evidence of moderate to large effects from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but evidence of their effectiveness when implemented nationally is lacking. In the Netherlands, the Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) initiated its successful guideline program 30 years ago. NHGDoc, a CDSS based on these NHG guidelines covering multiple disease areas for general practice, was developed in 2006 with the aim of improving the quality of primary care. In this paper, a protocol is presented to assess the uptake and effect of NHGDoc. METHODS: A cluster RCT is conducted among 120 general practitioner practices in the Netherlands. Eligible general practices will be randomized to receive either the regular NHGDoc decision support modules (control arm) or the regular modules plus an additional heart failure module (intervention arm). The Heart Failure module consists of patient-specific alarms to manage patients with heart failure. The impact assessment focuses on performance indicators (e.g. prescription behaviour) as well as patient outcomes (e.g. hospital admissions) that are relevant in the area of heart failure. In addition, a process assessment will be conducted to gain insight into the barriers and promoters affecting the uptake and impact of NHGDoc. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will provide insight into the uptake and impact of a multi-domain primary care CDSS implemented by a national guideline organization to improve the quality of primary care. While the study focuses on a specific area of care - heart failure - the conclusions of this study will shed light on the functioning of CDSSs covering multiple disease areas for primary care, particularly as this study also examines the factors contributing to the uptake and effectiveness of the system contribute.

Ten public sector organizations providing substance abuse or mental health services were randomly assigned to one of three training conditions: workshop and resources (WS+), WS+ and computer-based training (WS+/CAT), or WS+/CAT and supervisory support (WS+/CAT/SS) . Across conditions, 161 therapists participated in the training experiences, and measures were collected at baseline and at 2-month intervals for 12 months after workshop participation. Across the training conditions, therapists reported increased CM use, proficiency, and implementation adherence during the 12-month follow-up. Findings indicate that community practitioners are open to adopting evidence-based treatments when given access to useful resources. Additionally, high-quality workshops combined with access to resources can increase knowledge of evidence-based treatment and increase intervention adherence to levels needed to improve youth outcomes.",0,0,

METHOD: The study was conducted in six health authorities in Northern England and six in London. We have described three steps leading to this result: the consent of the GP practices to participate, the participation of the GPs in each practice in the visiting service carried out by the pharmacists; and GP prescribing practices are influenced by these visits. The results of each step were assessed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 102 randomly selected practices, 75 (73.5%) agreed to participate. The probability that all physicians in small practices (ie 1-2 partners) participated in the consultation was 6.7 (95% CI: 4.4-23.5) compared to other practices (ie > 3 partners). Although pharmacists reported that they had developed a good relationship at 100 (72%) initial visits and agreed on treatment plans for 110 (79%) of those visits, they were confident that the practice was likely to change their prescription in only 41%. these visits. Pharmacist and GP satisfaction with outreach visits did not necessarily lead to post-visit prescription changes, and GP knowledge of pharmacist-promoted guidelines did not necessarily lead to changes in clinical practice. The pharmacists identified organizational difficulties during follow-up appointments, GPs' skepticism about the evidence presented to them and the lack of interest on the part of physicians in changing their prescribing behavior as the main obstacles to implementing the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited to a post-hoc rather than a pre-hoc design, our study provides a pragmatic approach to understanding the factors influencing the pathway of prescribing behavior change in response to academic visits.",0,0,

Fifteen nurses on this ward volunteered to be subjects of the intervention to see if using the system would have a positive effect on their knowledge of pressure ulcers and their ability to make decisions about the subject. A similar care unit served as a control. In addition, the system was rated by experts for its didactic adequacy and by end users for their satisfaction with the system. Preliminary results show no impact on knowledge about pressure ulcers and no impact on clinical decision-making skills.

754,Evaluation of a dental health program for old-age pensioners in Denmark,"high priority is given to improving the oral health of older people in Scandinavia. In 1987, a Danish municipality established a dental public health care program for pensioners. All 67-year-old citizens were offered school-based preventive and curative care according to the guidelines and principles set by the Danish Municipal Dental Service for Children. The care was free. Citizens who do not wish to receive care through the public system can do so with private dentists. Reimbursement for services from the private system was provided by the state health insurance and the municipality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of the program after three years of operation. A follow-up design was used and data were collected through interviews and clinical registrations. At the beginning and at the follow-up examination, 216 (71%) and 235 (77%) retirees were asked about their self-assessment of their dental health, dental knowledge, attitudes and behavior. Clinical data were collected only for older people participating in the public program and included 194 people at baseline and 187 at follow-up. This data included information about tooth loss, tooth decay, periodontal health, and the presence and function of removable dentures. At follow-up, 86 percent of all respondents saw a dentist regularly at least once a year, compared to 46 percent at baseline"";"" 75 percent took part in the public program and 11 percent were treated by resident doctors. At the end of the intervention period, fewer older people reported symptoms of poor oral health or impaired denture function.",0,0,
755,Evaluation of a diabetes specialist-led diabetes treatment program in primary care,"PURPOSE: An initial pilot program showed promising results in improvements in glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and prompted us to expand these results into a controlled study to test . The purpose of the clinical study DAMET-2 (Diabetes-focused, Algorithm-directed care, Midlevel Practitioner-admitted, Electronically coached, Treatment) program (DAMET-2) was to assess the benefits of a novel program to disseminate treatment guidelines from diabetes from a central specialist clinic to primary care centers with access to middle-care provider services. DATA SOURCES: DAMET-2 included standardized treatment algorithms and training disseminated through computer-assisted and traditional telemedicine methods. Two primary care practices were selected and patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes > or = 6 months, > or = 18 years with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (identified by chart review) were eligible for enrollment. Intermediate-level practitioners for subjects in the experimental group (N=34) received training in American Diabetes Association treatment algorithms, had telephone consultations every 2 to 4 weeks and bimonthly visits to diabetes specialists, and received specialist treatment referrals within 24 hours of remote diabetes . Weekly diabetes clinics were provided to subjects in the experimental group. After 12 months, the latest available subject data were extracted from the subject horoscopes and compared to 12-month horoscope data from a control group (N = 101) that received no additional coursework. CONCLUSIONS: Mean HbA(1c) levels decreased from baseline by 0.46% in the active treatment group compared to 0.06% in the control group; however, reductions in HbA(1c) did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to the small sample size of the experimental group. Mean SBP levels were significantly reduced in both groups;"" however, LDL-C was significantly reduced only in the control group, where more aggressive use of statins may have had an effect. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Despite the inconsistencies in reducing risk factors versus the pilot program, the DAMET-2 program provided insights into the importance of electronic records and provider notifications, patient compliance, prioritization of provider resources by patient risk factor level, and access to self-management education.",0,0,
756,Evaluation of a knowledge transfer program to improve health promotion and disease prevention policy making and practices in French regions: a realistic study protocol,"Background Evidence-based decision-making and practice are central to public health. However, barriers remain and they relate to evidence properties, organizations and contexts. To address these important knowledge transfer (KT) questions, we need to rethink how knowledge is produced and used to improve our understanding of decision-making processes, logics and mechanisms, and to examine the ability of public health services to integrate research results into their decisions and surgeries. This article presents a realistic evaluation protocol to evaluate a KT system in prevention policy and practice at local level in France. Methods/Design This study is a comparative multiple case study that uses a realistic approach to evaluate a KT system in Regional Health Services (ARS) and Regional Nonprofit Health Education and Promotion Organizations (IREPS) by considering the configurations contexts/mechanisms/ results of it. The assessed KT scheme is designed to use six reviews of systematic reviews on the following topics: diet, alcohol, tobacco smoking, physical activity, emotional and sexual life, and psychosocial skills. It combines the following activities: supporting access to and adaptation of scientific and usable evidence""; strengthening professionals' abilities to analyse, adopt and use the evidence throughout their practice and decision-making process;"" Facilitate the use of evidence in the organizations and processes. RAMESE II reporting standards for realistic assessments were used. Discussion The objective of this study is to examine and characterize the factors related to the program's ability to enable public health stakeholders to address the challenges of CT and integrate scientific knowledge into policy and practice. We will use the realistic approach to document the parameters of successful KT strategies in the specific healthcare contexts in France, while attempting to determine the transferability of such strategies.",0,0,
757,Evaluation of a novel individualized communication skills training intervention to improve physicians' confidence and communication skills at the end of life,"BACKGROUND: We have developed a novel individualized end-of-life communication training program that is time-saving for busy junior physicians working in hospitals. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test this short individualized training program with young physicians to examine its acceptability, feasibility, and effect on physicians' self-confidence, communication skills, attitudes towards psychosocial care, and burnout. DESIGN: The content of the training intervention was supported by a systematic literature review and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on end-of-life communication. The intervention was based on sound pedagogical principles and consisted of three one-hour classroom sessions over a three-week period, including two one-on-one sessions with an experienced facilitator and a simulated patient/carer. In addition, participants received written and audiovisual learning materials to take home. PARTICIPANTS were videotaped with a simulated patient/carer before and after the training session to assess the impact of the course on their communication skills. PARTICIPANTS completed anonymized pre/post-training questionnaires including self-rated self-confidence, attitudes towards mental health care and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS were 22 junior physicians from a large teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: All participants reported that the training was useful, helpful in their communication with patients and that they would recommend the training to others. Significant improvements were seen in participants' communication skills (in seven of 21 specific and all three global communication behaviors assessed, range P = 0.02 to < 0.001), confidence in communicating about relevant issues (P < 0.001), attitudes towards mental health care ( P=0.03) and the sense of personal accomplishment (P=0.043). Overall, there were no differences in the burnout level of the participants. CONCLUSION: This intervention shows promise and warrants further formal evaluation.",0,0,
758,Evaluation of a medically oriented educational intervention for medical children with asthma,"BACKGROUND: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 1990 required screening of drug use in response to inappropriate drug use. Under the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, pediatric asthma is associated with high healthcare utilization and costs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a physician-centered educational intervention on asthma drug use and health care utilization. METHODS: The pre- and post-intervention comparison design was used in children aged 5 to 18 years who were enrolled from July 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999 (pre-intervention) and from March 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000 (post-intervention ). The intervention package included patient drug profiles, medical history, a monograph of national asthma management guidelines, and patient education materials for physicians. The main outcome measures are changes in asthma medication use in frequent users of short-acting beta(2)-agonists (SAB). RESULTS: The intervention focused on 2 criteria for asthma drug use: (1) high use of fast-relieving drugs and (2) use of salmeterol without availability of a fast-relieving drug. The intervention reduced the use of fast palliative medications by 26% in patients with higher use without significant changes in long-term control medications. In addition, 82% of recipients evaluated showed a positive change in salmeterol use, either by adding an SAB inhaler after the intervention or by discontinuing salmeterol after the intervention. There was no significant change in emergency room visits or asthma-related hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Although treating physicians agreed on the usefulness of the educational materials, the results suggest that the intervention had limited success in improving pharmacological management and had no impact on health outcomes. We believe that educational materials mailed to physicians can be effective in changing prescribing behavior"";"" however, a more multifaceted intervention may be needed to improve health outcomes.",0,0,
759,Evaluation of a tailored intervention to improve the management of overweight and obesity in primary care: study protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: In the UK around 22% of men and 24% of women are obese, and there are different but worrying figures in other European countries. Obesity is a chronic disease that poses a significant health risk. National guidelines for use in England to manage overweight or obese people have been published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2006). NICE recommendations for primary care teams are: ""Assess the level of overweight and obesity,"" assess lifestyle, comorbidities, and readiness for change, provide multicomponent management of overweight and obesity, and refer to outside services as appropriate. These Study examines a tailored intervention to improve implementation of these recommendations by primary care teams METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Primary care teams will be recruited from the East Midlands of England and randomized into two study arms: 1) the study group in which primary care teams A range of tailored interventions will be offered to support the implementation of NICE's overweight and obesity guidelines."" or 2) the control group, in which primary care teams continue to provide usual care. The primary outcome is the proportion of overweight or obese patients for whom the GP team adheres to NICE guidelines. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients with lifestyle assessment records, referral to outside weight loss services, proportion of obese patients who lose weight during the intervention period, and mean weight change over the same period. DISCUSSION: Although often recommended, the methods for adapting implementation interventions to the determinants of practice are not well developed. This study is part of a study program designed to develop methods for tailor-made implementation. STUDY REGISTRATION: Current controlled studies ISRCTN07457585. Registered on 09/08/2013.

760,Evaluation of a toolkit to improve cardiovascular disease screening and treatment in people with type 2 diabetes: protocol for a cluster-randomized pragmatic study,"BACKGROUND: The discrepancy between the level of care recommended by evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and actual patient care in practice is well known. The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) has developed an implementation strategy to improve implementation of its 2008 guidelines. This study will assess the impact of the strategy to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening, prevention and treatment for people with diabetes. DESIGN: A pragmatic cluster-randomized study is conducted to evaluate the CDA's CVD toolkit. All primary care physicians in Ontario, Canada were randomly assigned to receive the toolkit, which includes several printed educational materials on CVD screening, prevention, and treatment, in either Spring 2009 (intervention arm) or Spring 2010 (control arm). The randomization took place at the practice level. Forty primary care physicians from each arm will be recruited to participate, and the medical records of 20 of their diabetics at high risk for cardiovascular disease will be retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures will be evaluated for each patient between July 2009 and March 2010. The primary outcome will be that the patient receives a statin. Secondary outcomes include 1) intake of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 2) various intermediate measurements (A1c, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, body mass index, and waist circumference), and 3) clinical inertia (failure to change therapy in response to abnormal A1c, blood pressure, or cholesterol). The analysis is performed using multilevel hierarchical logistic regression models to account for the clustered nature of the data. Group assignment is a physician-level variable. In addition, a process assessment study with six primary care physician focus groups will assess the acceptability of the CDA toolkit and examine factors contributing to change or non-change in behavior from a primary care physician perspective. DISCUSSION: Printed physician educational materials have been shown to bring about small to moderate changes in patient care. CDA's CVD toolkit is an example of a strategy for implementing guidelines that can be disseminated to a wide audience relatively inexpensively. Therefore, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving diabetes care could have important ramifications for guideline developers, policy makers, and clinicians.",0,0,
761,Evaluation of abnormal mammography results and palpable breast abnormalities,"Background: Because approximately 1 in 10 women with a breast lump or an abnormal mammogram result will have breast cancer, a number of decisions must be made by a primary care physician to rule out or diagnose breast cancer in these women. Purpose: To determine the most accurate and least invasive means to evaluate an abnormal mammogram result and palpable breast abnormality with abnormal mammogram results or palpable breast abnormalities. Study selection: The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that provided relevant primary data. Studies were included if 1) a mammogram, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or core needle biopsy was performed before a definitive diagnosis was made; 2) the study sample included 100 or more women;"" and 3) breast cancer status was determined by histopathological review of excisional biopsy specimens, linkage to a state cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, or clinical follow-up of 95% or more of the study sample definitely. Data Extraction: An investigator abstracted the results. The methods were evaluated for major potential biases, but no methodological evaluation was performed. Data Synthesis: Odds ratios for primary mammography screening were 0.1 for the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category of negative or benign finding and 1.2 for probably benign finding, 7 for need for additional imaging study, 125 for suspicious abnormalities and 2200 for findings strongly suggestive of malignancy. In a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a palpable nodule performed by formally trained physicians, the odds ratio was infinity for a malignant rating, 2.6 for atypical/suspicious, and 0.02 for benign. When diagnostic mammography was used to evaluate a palpable lump or non-palpable breast abnormality, positive likelihood ratios were 5.6 and 9.4 and negative likelihood ratios were 0.15 and 0.19, respectively, indicative of malignancy, are at high risk of breast cancer and should undergo core needle biopsy or needle localization with surgical biopsy. Women whose mammography screening results are interpreted as requiring additional imaging are at moderate risk of breast cancer and should undergo diagnostic mammography or ultrasonography to decide whether an unpalpable breast lesion should be biopsied. Women whose screening mammography results are interpreted as probably benign have a low risk of breast cancer and can have a follow-up mammography in 6 months. Either fine-needle aspiration biopsy or ultrasonography is recommended as the first diagnostic test of a palpable breast abnormality to distinguish simple cysts from solid tumors. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy also allows characterization of a solid mass. Diagnostic mammography does not help decide whether a palpable breast mass should be biopsied and should not influence the decision to perform a biopsy.",0,0,
762,Evaluation of an information leaflet on AIDS/HIV infection aimed at healthcare professionals in Catalonia,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the understanding and acceptance of a periodic information booklet on HIV/AIDS by healthcare professionals. DESIGN: Crossover. SETTING: Primary care teams from Institut Catala de la Salut. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 300 physicians, registered nurses, and social workers. INTERVENTION: A self-completed, anonymous questionnaire returned by regular mail. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The questions covered the following subject areas: clinical care for people infected with HIV/AIDS and requests for diagnostic testing for infection, perceptions of skills to promote changes in patients' sexual behavior and drug use, provision of psychological support and guidelines for Integrating HIV+ children in schools and information on social resources. 60% knew the publication. Topics that aroused great interest were: psychological support for those affected, prevention of HIV infection in the healthcare system, clinical counseling and diagnostics. 77% had received requests for diagnostic tests and 88% had visited infected people. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low response rate (50%) and the relative variability between professionals and the health regions they came from, this initial assessment allowed us to identify specific educational needs in the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS infection in the primary school care framework and also to improve the distribution methods we use.",0,0,
763,Evaluation of an internet-based decision support system for the application of the ATS/CDC guidelines for tuberculosis prevention therapy.,"Preventive therapy for patients infected with tuberculosis (TB) remains an important part of TB control. To guide physicians in using preventive therapy, the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) have developed guidelines based on PPD reactivity and likelihood of infection prior to testing. The guidelines have become complex and many clinicians find them difficult to apply. The authors developed a computerized decision support system to assist physicians in applying ATS/CDC guidelines. This tool, published on the World Wide Web using hypertext markup language, provides patient-specific recommendations based on patient-specific information provided by the physician. Four local TB experts derived eight TB infection scenarios and validated the web-based tool, which was tested for efficacy using randomly divided two groups of general practitioners. Group A (n = 12) used the web-based tool and Group B (n = 17) used a pre-existing understanding of the guidelines and/or written resources to determine the need for preventive therapy in the case studies. Group A used the therapy correctly in 92/96 possible cases (95.8%), group B only in 77/136 (56.6%) (p<0.001). Group A needed an average of three mouse clicks and 1.5 minutes per scenario to make their choices and rated the web-based tool as intuitive and effective. These data show that a computer-based decision support system for applying TB treatment guidelines can be delivered over the Internet and is an efficient and effective resource for clinicians.",0,1,

Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial. Recruitment: 27 GP practices in Avon. Participants: 614 patients between the ages of 60 and 79 years with hypertension. Interventions: Patients were randomized to a computer-assisted clinical decision support system plus cardiovascular risk chart”; cardiovascular risk graph only;' or usual care. Main outcome measures: Percentage of patients in each group with a five-year cardiovascular risk = 10%, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular medication prescription. Results: Patients in the computer-assisted clinical decision support system and in the table groups were no more likely to have cardiovascular risk reduced to less than 10% than patients receiving usual care. Patients in the computer-assisted clinical decision support group were more likely to have cardiovascular risk = 10% than patients alone, odds ratio 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.8). The chart-only group had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure compared to the usual care group (mean difference -4.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -8.4 to -0.8). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure did not differ between the three groups.The graph-only group was twice as likely to be prescribed two classes of cardiovascular drugs and more than three times as likely to be prescribed three or more classes of drugs compared to the other groups B. for absolute risk reduction or blood pressure control and requires further development and evaluation before use in clinical care can be recommended.",1,1,
765,Evaluation of internet-based clinical decision support systems.,"Background: Scientifically based clinical guidelines are increasingly being used to train physicians and to improve the quality of care. While individual guidelines may be useful, repeated studies have shown that guidelines are ineffective in changing physician behavior. The Internet has emerged as a potentially useful tool for guideline education, dissemination, and implementation because of its open standards and ability to provide concise, relevant clinical information where and when it is needed. Aim: Our aim was to develop and test decision support systems (DSS) based on clinical guidelines that can be delivered over the Internet for two disease models: asthma and tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy. Methods: Using open HTML and CGI standards, we developed a DSS for assessment of acute asthma severity and a DSS for preventive treatment of tuberculosis based on content of national guidelines recognized as treatment standards. Both DSS are published on the web and use a decision algorithm developed from the overarching guidelines with clinical information provided by the user at the time of clinical care. We tested the effectiveness of each DSS in influencing physician decisions using clinical scenario testing. Results: First, we validated the asthma algorithm by comparing the decisions made by asthma professionals with the decisions made by nonpulmonary nurses using the computerized DSS. Using the DSS, nurses performed the same as experts (89% vs. 88%; p=NS). Using the same scenario testing instrument, we next compared internists using the DSS to residents using a printed version of the National Asthma Education Program 2 guidelines. Residents using the computerized DSS performed significantly better than residents using the used paper-based guidelines (92% vs. 84%; p<0.002). Similarly, we compared residents using the computerized TB-DSS to residents using a printed reference card; residents who used the computerized DSS performed significantly better (95.8% vs. 56.6% correct;"" p<0.001). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that guidelines disseminated through traditional educational interventions are only have minimal impact on physician behavior. Although computerized DSS has been effective in changing physician behavior, many of these systems are not widely available. We have developed two clinical DSS based on national guidelines and published them on the web. Both systems improved the Physician compliance with national guidelines when tested in clinical scenarios By providing information coupled to relevant activities, we expect these widely used DSSs to serve as effective educational tools to positively influence physician behavior .",0,1,
766,Evaluation of studies on the effectiveness of clinical services provided by pharmacists,"quantitative review of randomized trials of counseling, educational, and other clinical services provided by pharmacists was conducted. Data sources were MEDLINE and the bibliographies of published articles. Pharmacists' services were categorized as patient consultation, physician consultation, patient and physician consultation, and patient care. The extracted results were measures of patient behavior, disease, symptoms, and patient knowledge. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. The pharmacists were identified as clinical pharmacists in 24 studies and as practicing pharmacists in 2 studies. In six open-label patient counseling studies, the results in each study favored the counseled patients over the control patients, and the effects were statistically significant in five studies (the outcome was medication adherence in these five studies). In seven trials of counseling patients and their physicians, patient outcomes were significantly better in the intervention group in six trials, four of which were single-blind. Two studies in which patients were randomized to either a doctor's consultation or a control group yielded conflicting results. In a study in which physicians were randomized to receive advice from pharmacists, the proportion of prescriptions that met guidelines was higher in the advice group than in the control group. Four studies of patient care by pharmacists were inconclusive. These studies showed that pharmacists' counseling of patients and their physicians can improve treatment outcomes. Evidence that counseling patients alone improved patient outcomes was good, albeit weaker due to the suboptimal study design.",0,0,

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial (April 2002-December 2005). SETTING 13 construction sites in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS 569 parents completed baseline surveys at work, gave permission to send confidential surveys to their adolescent children, and were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Parents and adolescents took part in follow-up surveys one week, three months and nine months after the program. INTERVENTION Talking Parents, Healthy Teens consists of eight weekly one-hour workplace sessions for parents of adolescent children in grades 6 through 10 (ages approximately 11 to 16). KEY OUTCOMES Communication between parents and young people about a list of sexual topics; whether parents taught the adolescent how to use a condom; ability to communicate with parents/adolescents about sex; Openness of parent-adolescent communication about sex. RESULTS Differences between intervention and control groups were significant for the mean number of new sexual topics that parents and adolescents reported discussing between baseline and each follow-up (p<0.001 for each); Intervention parents were less likely than controls to discuss no new topics (8% vs. 29%, 95% confidence interval for difference 16% to 24%) and were more likely to discuss seven or more new topics (38% vs. 8%, 19% to 41 %) at nine months. Some differences increased after program completion: at One week after program, 18% of adolescents in the intervention group and 3% in the control group (6% to 30%) reported that their parents had checked in since the start of the study how to use a condom (p<0.001);"" this increased to 29% vs. 5% (13% to 36%) (P<0.001) at nine months.

768,Evaluation of two school smoking education programs under normal classroom conditions,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of two school-based smoking education projects in delaying the onset of smoking behavior and improving health literacy, beliefs, and values. DESIGN Cluster randomized controlled trial of two projects taught under normal classroom conditions. Schools were assigned to one of four groups to complete the Family Smoking Education Project (FSE), the Smokers and Me Project (SAM), both projects in sequence (FSE/SAM); or not intervened at all. LOCAL AREA 39 schools in Wales and England, matched in size and catchment profile. PARTICIPANTS All first graders in the schools were included and assessed on three occasions (4538 before class (1988), 3930 immediately after class (1989), 3786 after one year of follow-up (1990)). KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported smoking behavior (supported by a saliva sample) and change in relevant health knowledge, beliefs, and values. RESULTS No consistent significant differences in smoking behavior, health knowledge, beliefs, or values were found between the four groups. Among the never-smokers at baseline, the rate of remaining never-smokers in 1990 was 74% (594/804) in the control group, 65% (455/704) in the FAE group, 70% (440/625) in the SAM group, and 69% (549/791) in the FAE/SAM group (chi 2adj = 6.1, df = 3, p = 0.1). Knowledge of the effects of smoking increased in all groups from an average score of 5.4 in 1988 to 6.4 in 1989 and 6.5 in 1990. CONCLUSIONS To reduce smoking among teenagers, interventions are more comprehensive than those school health education required. Other measures, including further restrictions on access to cigarettes and the promotion of tobacco products, need to be considered. Further research is needed to develop effective school-based health education projects, which should be formally tested under normal field conditions before being widely disseminated.",0,0,
769,Evidence-based behavioral medicine: what is it and how do we achieve it?,"Ultimately, the goal of evidence-based medicine is to improve patient outcomes and the quality of care. Systematic reviews of the available published evidence are needed to identify interventions that result in improvements in behavior, health, and well-being. Relevant literature reviews depend on the quality of published research and research reports. The Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement (www.consort-statement.org) was developed to improve the design and reporting of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) interventions in medical journals. We describe the 22 CONSORT guidelines and explain their application in behavioral health research and evidence-based practice. Additional guidelines specific to behavioral medicine (e.g. adherence to therapy) are also presented. The use of these guidelines by clinicians, educators, policymakers, and researchers who design, report, and evaluate or review RCTs will empower the research itself and accelerate efforts to apply behavioral health research to improve the processes and outcomes of behavioral health practice.",0,0,
770,Evidence-based care of older people with suspected cognitive impairment in general practice: protocol for the randomized IRIS cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common and complex disease. There are evidence-based guidelines for the management of people with dementia in general practice"";"" However, detection, diagnosis and disclosure of dementia have been identified as potential evidence-practice gaps. Interventions to put guidelines into practice have had varying degrees of success. The use of theory in designing implementation interventions has been limited, but is advocated because it has the potential to produce more effective interventions and to aid in understanding factors that modify the magnitude of intervention effects across studies. This protocol describes methods of a randomized trial testing a theory-guided implementation intervention that, if effective, may provide benefits for patients with dementia and their caregivers. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a theory-driven intervention to increase adherence to a clinical guideline for the detection, diagnosis and treatment of dementia in general practice by primary care physicians (in Victoria, Australia) compared to the provision of General practitioners with a printed copy of the guideline. Primary objectives include testing whether the intervention is effective in increasing the percentage of patients with suspected cognitive impairment receiving treatment that is consistent with two key guideline recommendations: obtaining ai) formal cognitive assessment and ii) a depression rating using a validated scale (primary outcomes for the trial). METHODS: The design is a parallel cluster randomized trial, where clusters are general practices. Our goal is to recruit 60 practices per group. Practices are randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups by means of limited randomization. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and the general practitioners' recognition and diagnosis behavior towards these patients will be identified and measured nine months after the start of the intervention via an electronic search in the medical records. Practitioners in the control group receive a printed copy of the guideline. In addition to receiving the printed guideline, practitioners in the intervention group will be invited to participate in an interactive, opinion leader-led, face-to-face workshop. The theory-led intervention aims to address identified barriers and enablers to implementing recommendations. Researchers responsible for identifying the cohort of patients with suspected cognitive impairment and their detection and diagnosis outcomes are blind to group assignment.

For those who would like to use this evidence-based, patient-centered method as a template for their own teaching, here we describe our training program for the first time—and suggest that the training be for students, physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and other new learners. The training was competency-based and experiential, fostered a positive attitude towards patient-centred interviewing, and used a learner-centred approach that paid particular attention to the teacher-resident relationship and the resident's self-esteem. The skill training was guided by a newly identified patient-centered interview method that described the step-by-step application of specific behaviors.",0,0,
772,Evidence-Based Guidelines for the Management of Bipolar Disorder: Revised Recommendations from the Third Edition of the British Association for Psychopharmacology,"The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines specify the scope and goals of treatment for bipolar disorder. The third version is explicitly based on the available evidence and, like previous clinical practice guidelines, is presented as a recommendation to support clinical decision making for practitioners: it can also serve as a source of information for patients and carers and support audits. The recommendations are presented together with a more detailed review of the relevant evidence. A consensus meeting, attended by experts in bipolar disorder and its treatment, reviewed key areas and reviewed the weight of evidence and clinical implications. The guidelines were created after extensive feedback from these participants. The best evidence from randomized controlled trials and, where available, observational studies with quasi-experimental designs was used to evaluate treatment options. The strength of the recommendations was described using the GRADE approach. The guidelines cover the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, clinical management, and strategies for drug use in the short-term treatment of episodes, prevention of recurrence, and discontinuation of treatment. The use of medication is integrated into a coherent approach to psychoeducation and behavior change.",0,0,
773,Evidence-based health care for children: what are we missing?,"With the enactment of major healthcare reform, reimbursement for a variety of healthcare services will likely depend on evidence supporting that provision. Understanding what constitutes “evidence” will have profound implications for the range of clinical care provided. Too narrow a definition can have significant implications for pediatric care in particular: much of current pediatric care requires consideration of a broader evidence base than is typically relied on when developing clinical guidelines. This is especially true when treating behavioral and developmental problems. The current standard for evaluating evidence uses study design as a proxy for the quality of evidence"";"" it may therefore inadvertently exclude many important findings and fail to support further relevant research.

A mailed questionnaire included questions about GP demographics and practice characteristics, awareness of EBM, sources of information about migraine and EBM; and treatment behavior of the patient. Only 27.2% of GPs agreed that clinical trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, and this awareness was higher among those who learned about migraine from scientific journals or continuing education courses and attended courses on EBM. For two-thirds of primary care physicians, a disability equates to a disease diagnosis, and this behavior was more common among those who agreed that clinical trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive or curative treatments for migraine and that the clinical approach to migraine evaluation requires clinical efficacy in those who treated smaller numbers of headache sufferers who were elderly and in those who did not follow guidelines. The majority (93.1%) of GPs indicated that it was important to integrate clinical practice and the best available evidence, and this behavior was significantly more common among those who agreed that the clinical approach to treating migraine was a clinical efficacy evaluation requires, ie clinical trials required to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive or curative treatments of migraine and among those who have attended EBM courses. Training and education programs on EBM and headache management guidelines for primary care physicians are urgently needed.",0,0,
775,Evidence-based Medicine and Women: Do EBM Principles and Practice Promote Women's Health?,"Clinicians and policy makers around the world embrace Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). The promise of EBM is to use summaries of research to determine which health interventions are effective and which are not, so patients can benefit from effective interventions and be protected from useless or harmful ones. EBM provides a seemingly rational objective means of deciding whether or not an intervention should be provided based on its effectiveness, theoretically leading to fair and effective healthcare for all. In this paper, I examine these claims from the perspective of women's health care, using relevant examples. I contend that the current processes of evidence-based medicine contain a number of prejudices against women. These biases appear in the production of research that informs evidence-based medicine, in the methods used to analyze and synthesize the evidence, and in the application of EBM through the use of guidelines. Finally, the biomedical model of health that underpins most of the medical research used by EBM ignores the social and political context that contributes so much to women's ill health.",0,0,
776,Medicine based on facts. Interpreting studies and setting policies,"The rise of EBM has been accompanied by a greater awareness of its shortcomings. The cost, length and difficulty of conducting RCTs makes it increasingly clear that studies cannot be conducted on every medical issue. Good evidence is often lacking in medicine. Epistomologists question the very notions of evidence and the suitability of current study designs and measurement tools to examine the salient problems faced by patients and others concerned with quality. The lack of evidence of effectiveness does not prove ineffectiveness, but in response to EBM, insurance companies and governments often make this conclusion to justify decisions to withhold coverage or research support. The unbridled enthusiasm for the evidence-based practice guideline of the early 1990s has been tempered by a more mature understanding of its limitations. Not many practice guidelines are well developed, and implementing flawed guidelines can be damaging. The seven-step process outlined above is slow, tedious, and expensive (sometimes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars). Furthermore, there is little evidence that either the rigor of the methods or the guidelines themselves have any meaningful impact on practice behavior or patient outcomes. To the most cynical observer, the only consistent beneficiaries of policies are payers, who use policies with notable success in reducing costs, dwell time, and usage rates. Even ardent supporters of guidelines recognize that the dissemination of reviews and recommendations alone does not motivate clinicians to increase the delivery of effective interventions and abandon ineffective ones. This lack of response has prompted a closer look at the barriers to behavior change and the development of thoughtful implementation strategies that start with simple policies but go beyond. Tools such as reminder systems, standing orders, academic detailing, peer review and audit, feedback and healthcare system changes recognize that knowing what to do is just one piece of an increasingly complex puzzle. The highly competitive market for managed healthcare has added new economic influences on clinician behavior, but it is also fueling the private sector's interest in good research. Patients, physicians and policy makers will continue to seek better data on what works and what doesn't in medicine.",0,0,
777,Examining the Analytical Quality of Randomized Clinical Trials in Behavioral Health,"Adopting an evidence-based practice policy (EBP) has implications for clinicians and researchers alike. In areas that have already adopted EBP, evidence-based practice guidelines derive from systematic reviews of research. Ultimately, such guidelines serve as tools used by practitioners. Systematic reviews of treatment efficacy and effectiveness reserve their strongest recommendations for treatments, supported by high-quality randomized clinical trials (RCTs). It is unknown how well RCTs reported in behavioral science journals compare to quality standards set in areas that pioneered the evidence-based movement. We compared analytical quality characteristics of all behavioral health RCTs (n = 73) published between January 2000 and July 2003 in three leading behavioral journals and two leading medical journals for an acute or chronic physical disease or condition. The results revealed weaknesses in analytical aspects of the behavioral health RCTs reported in both journal series. Weaknesses were more pronounced in behavioral journals. The authors provide recommendations for improving the analytical quality of behavioral health RCTs to ensure that evidence on behavioral therapies is heavily weighted in systematic reviews.",0,0,

779,Exceptional Births: Home Births as Ethical Anomalies in American Obstetrics,"Interest in home births appears to be growing among American women, and most obstetricians can expect to encounter patients who are considering home births. In 2011, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a statement to help obstetricians manage such patients. In this article, I examine the ACOG Statement in light of the historical and contemporary clinical realities surrounding homebirth in the United States, an investigation guided in part by my own experiences as an obstetrician in relation to pro-homebirth and anti-homebirth medical milieus. Comparison with other guidelines shows that ACOG treats home birth as an ethical exception: Comparable evidence leads to strikingly different recommendations in the case of home birth and in the case of trial labor after a previous cesarean section"";"" and ACOG treats other controversial issues that involve similar ethical issues very differently. By providing information not only as the primary but the sole ethical responsibility of the obstetrician, the ACOG Statement circumvents the obstetrician's responsibility to provide appropriate clinical care and the safest clinical environment for those mothers who choose to have a home birth, and to create for their newborns. What at first glance seems like a declaration of respect for women's autonomy implicitly authorizes behaviors that unethically limit genuinely autonomous choices. Obstetricians don't have to attend home births, I argue. However, our ethical duties oblige us to (1) refer clients to qualified clinicians who attend a home birth, (2) continue respectful prenatal care for women who choose to have a home birth, (3) provide appropriate counseling to home birth attendants, and (4) to ensure that the transfer of care is smooth and unpunished.",0,0,
780,"Exercise advice: the public health panacea for promoting physical activity? A Critical Perspective of Exercise Referral Programs"";"" their development and evaluation","This review critically examines the development, impact and evaluation of exercise referral schemes (ERS) in the UK. Rapid expansion of the use of such ERSs has been recorded in recreational and primary care settings, but evidence supporting their implementation has been sparse and mostly limited to randomized controlled trials (RCT) research design. Consequently, the understanding of the exercise recommendation as a “real world” intervention was limited. Given the increasing importance placed on evidence-based practice and clinical effectiveness, it is no longer sufficient for providers of exercise recommendations to ignore the need to evaluate programs. The assessment guidelines provided by the National Quality Assurance Framework for Exercise Referral are limited, so practitioners are often unsure of which measures to assess effectiveness are most appropriate. Training professionals focus mostly on collecting physiological data, but ignore relevant psychological and environmental parameters. Also, few UK studies have followed participants long-term to see if physical activity behaviors persist over time. Evidence from two ongoing large-scale (n=1600/year) evaluation studies of exercise recommendation schemes based in urban locations in North West England is described here. A participatory action research framework for assessment was used and integrated multi-method research approaches for assessment of both ERS participants and health professionals involved in delivery of interventions. This framework is an appropriate methodology for the assessment and development of complex interventions and here includes case studies, focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. Included was a 12-month follow-up study of a cohort of participants with exercise recommendation (n = 342) measuring the amount of leisure physical activity (Godin leisure score) at baseline (entry into exercise recommendation) and thereafter at 3-month intervals measured . ERS compliance was around 35-45%, with older participants more likely to complete. Physiological changes during the ERS, while statistically significant, were not of a magnitude to convey any real health benefit to an individual's health status. Although small in scale, all physiological changes were in a positive direction (e.g., lowering blood pressure) and, if sustained over time, could confer population-level health benefits. Participants referred by cardiac and practice nurses had higher adherence than participants referred by general practitioners. Scheme B showed that participants (n=103) who adhered to the end of the ERS (12 weeks) were able to sustain a small increase in physical activity at the end of 12 months (increase of 21 minutes of moderate activity/week vs to baseline). In summary, this research shows that the exercise recommendation process benefits certain segments of the population, but not necessarily all.",0,0,
781,"Expanded HIV screening in the United States: Implications for clinical outcomes, HIV transmission, and costs","Background: A large body of literature supports expanded HIV screening in the United States. However, the question of who to test and how often remains controversial. Aim: To inform the design of HIV screening programs by identifying combinations of screening frequency and HIV prevalence and incidence where screening is cost-effective. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis linking simulation models of HIV screening to published reports on the risk of HIV transmission with and without antiretroviral therapy. Data sources: Published randomized trials, observational cohorts, national cost and service use surveys, the Red Book, and previous modeling results. Target Population: US communities with low to moderate HIV prevalence (0.05% to 1.0%) and annual incidence (0.0084% to 0.12%). Time horizon: lifetime. Perspective: Social. Interventions: One-time and increasingly frequent voluntary HIV screening of all adults with a rapid same-day test. Outcome measures: HIV infection detected, secondary transmission prevented, quality-adjusted survival, lifetime medical cost, and societal cost-effectiveness expressed in discounted 2004 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Base-case analysis results: Using moderately favorable assumptions about the effect of HIV patient care on secondary transmission, routine HIV screening in a population with an HIV prevalence of 1.0% and an annual incidence of 0.12% an incremental cost-effectiveness of $30,800/QALY (one time screening), $32,300/QALY (screening every 5 years), and $55,500/QALY (screening every 3 years). In settings with an HIV prevalence of 0.10% and an annual incidence of 0.014%, a single screening resulted in a cost-effectiveness of $60,700/QALY. Results of the sensitivity analysis: The cost-effectiveness of screening measures varied within a narrow range as assumptions about the effect of screening on secondary transmission varied from favorable to unfavorable. Assuming moderately beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy on transmission, in settings with an HIV prevalence of only 0.20%, the cost-benefit ratio remained for routine HIV screening on a one-time basis and with prevalences as low as 0, 45% and below $50,000/QALY annually Incidences as low as 0.0075% for screening every 5 years. Limitations: This analysis does not address the difficulty of determining the prevalence and incidence of undetected HIV infection in a specific patient population. Conclusions: Routine rapid HIV testing is recommended for all adults except in settings where there is evidence that the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection is below 0.2%.",0,0,
782,Expanding the use of continuous sedation until death: Going beyond last resort for the terminally ill,"As currently practiced, the use of continuous sedation until death (CSD) is controlled by clinicians in a way that may deny patients an important choice in controlling their dying process. Ethical guidelines from the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pain Medicine describe CSD as a ""last resort,"" and a statement from the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine describes it as ""an intervention reserved for extreme situations."" Accordingly, patients must progress to incessant pain and suffering and reach a final intermediate stage before the option of pursuing CSD is considered. Alternatively, we present and defend a new guideline in which competent, terminally ill patients with a life expectancy of less than six months can request CSD before exposing the refractory condition to “last resort” treatment.",0,0,
783,Experience-based design: from redesigning the system around the patient to co-designing services with the patient,"Involving patients in service improvement and listening and responding to what they say has played a key role in redesigning healthcare delivery processes over the last five years and more. Patients and users have attended stakeholder events, participated in Discovery interviews, completed surveys, mapped healthcare processes, and even designed new hospitals with healthcare workers. So far, however, efforts have not necessarily focused on the patient's experience, apart from what has been good and what has not been. No questions were asked to find out details about how the experience was or should be ('experience' is different from 'attitudes') and the information was then used systematically to design services together with patients. The knowledge of the experience that only the patient possesses is unique and precious. This paper draws attention to the emerging discipline of design science and experience-based design, in which the traditional view of the user as the passive recipient of a product or service has begun to give way to the new view of the user as an integral part of the improvement and innovation process.",0,0,
784,Expert panel vs. recommendations for decision analysis for coronary angiography after myocardial infarction discharge,"Context Panels of experts and decision-analytic techniques are increasingly used to determine the appropriateness of medical interventions, but these two approaches use different methods of processing evidence. Aim To compare the adequacy ratings of the expert panel on coronary angiography after myocardial infarction (from the time of hospital discharge to 12 weeks after the infarction) with the health gains and cost-effectiveness predicted by a decision analytical model. Design To compare the degree of importance of clinical variables considered in expert panel adequacy ratings with a previously published decision analytic model. Identification of 36 clinical scenarios from the expert panel that could be simulated by the decision analytical model. Main outcome measures adequacy score and adequacy classification (expert panel) vs. gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (decision analytical model). Results The key clinical variables were similar between the two approaches, with the exercise tolerance test result having the greatest impact on the strength of the recommendation for angiography. Among the expert panel clinical scenarios that were considered appropriate for coronary angiography and could be simulated in the decision analysis model, the median (interquartile range) health gain and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 0.59 (0.41-0.76) QALYs and $27,000 ($23,000). -$35,000) per QALY won. Among the clinical scenarios deemed inappropriate by expert panels, the corresponding medians (interquartile ranges) were 0.24 (0.19-0.34) QALYs and $54,000 ($36,000-58,000) per QALY gained. The Spearman rank correlation between the adequacy score and QALY gain was 0.58 (P<0.001) and between the adequacy score and the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 0.66 (P<0.001). Conclusions For the 36 expert panel scenarios that could be simulated by the decision analytic model, there was moderate to good agreement between the adequacy score and both the health gain and the incremental cost-effectiveness of coronary angiography compared to no angiography Convalescent phase of acute myocardial infarction, but several scenarios judged inappropriate by the expert panel approach had cost-effectiveness comparable to many commonly recommended medical interventions.

785,Explaining the impact of two different strategies to promote hand hygiene among hospital nurses: a process evaluation alongside a randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of why hand hygiene improvement strategies succeed or fail. It is therefore important to look into the ""black box"" of such strategies to determine which components of a strategy work well and which work less well. This study examined which components of two strategies to improve hand hygiene were associated with increased hand hygiene compliance by caregivers. METHODS: A process evaluation of a randomized controlled cluster study was performed in which a portion of the nursing wards of three hospitals in the Netherlands received a state-of-the-art strategy including education, reminders, feedback, and optimization of materials and facilities. ;"" Another part received a team and leadership oriented strategy that included all elements of the state-of-the-art strategy, complemented by activities aimed at social and leadership improvement. This process evaluation used four sets of measures: Impact on nurses' hand hygiene compliance, adherence to improvement strategies, contextual factors, and nurses' experiences with strategy components.Analysis of variance and multiple regression analyzes were used to examine changes in nurses' hand hygiene compliance and thereby better understand study effects.RESULTS:Both strategies were performed with good adherence to protocol Two contextual factors were associated with changes in hand hygiene compliance: a long-term hospital effect (p<0.05) and high baseline hand hygiene scores were associated with smaller effects (p<0.01). correlated changes in the hand hygiene compliance of the nurses positively with the experience feedback about their hand hygiene performance (p < 0.05). In the long term, several items of the components ""social influence"" (ie addressing each other in the event of undesirable hand hygiene behavior p < 0.01) and ""leadership"" (ie ward management holds team members responsible for hand hygiene performance p < 0.01) correlated positively with changes in hand hygiene compliance of the nursing staff. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the use of process evaluation to uncover mechanisms underlying change in strategies to improve hand hygiene. Our study results demonstrate the added value of specific aspects of social influence and leadership in hand hygiene improvement strategies, and thus provide an interpretation of the study effects.

786,Discussing variations in primary care physician referral rates for back pain X-rays,"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of clinical guidelines for the management of low back pain (LBP), large disparities in general practitioner (GP) referral rates for lumbar spine (LSX) X-rays remain. This study aims to explain the differences in primary care physician referral rates for LSX from their reports of treating patients with back pain. METHODS: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 29 GPs with high and low referral rates for LSX in North East England. The thematic analysis used constant comparison techniques. RESULTS: Common and divergent themes were identified among heavy and light users of LSX. Topics that were similar in both groups included awareness of current guidelines for use of LSX in patients with LBP and pressure from patients and institutional factors to order an LSX. Differentiating themes for the high-user group included: belief that LSX offers patients safety that can outweigh the risks, pessimism about treatment options for LBP, and belief that rejection of LSX will harm the physician relationship and would affect the patient. Two specific differentiating issues are considered in more detail: primary care physicians' awareness of their use of lumbar spine radiology compared to others, and the perceived risks associated with LSX irradiation. CONCLUSION: Several key factors differentiate the reports of high and low referral rates for LSX by primary care physicians despite being aware of the clinical guidelines recommendations. Intervention studies aiming to increase compliance with guideline recommendations on the use of LSX by changing the regulatory behavior of primary care physicians should focus on these factors.",0,0,
787,Explanation of the differences in prescription costs across England,"OBJECTIVE To derive a predictive model for national prescribing behavior in relation to underlying morbidity and demographic factors. DESIGN 24 Demographic, morbidity, and practice factors were input into multiple regression analysis to determine the net cost of ingredients per patient. SETTING The 90 family health authorities in England for 1989. RESULTS For the net component cost per patient, only two demographic factors (number of pensioners and the mobility of the registered population as measured by list inflation) and two morbidity-related factors (standardized mortality rates and numbers). of advance payment certificates issued) contributed significantly to a multiple regression model. This model explained 81% of the differences in net ingredient costs per enrolled patient between family health authorities. The model also allowed the derivation of a weighting factor of 4.6 (95% confidence interval 3.2 to 6.7) for the net drug cost for elderly patients (compared to the existing prescription unit factor of 3). CONCLUSIONS The model shows that variations in prescription costs largely reflect demand. It also suggests that the current prescription unit value of 3 for patients 65 years and older underestimates the additional cost of prescribing for older patients.",0,0,
788,Exploratory analysis of patients' motivation to quit smoking and to participate in smoking cessation courses,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Significant research has examined the effects of smoking, the effects of exposure to secondhand smoke, the effectiveness of a variety of social and individual smoking cessation interventions, and the frequency with which physicians talk to their patients about smoking cessation. Little research has addressed barriers to physician-initiated discussions and interventions related to smoking cessation, particularly in relation to office-based physicians treating low-income patients. Existing research shows that physicians have low expectations of patients' desire to quit and often wait to discuss smoking cessation with patients until the patient raises the issue. The purpose of this pilot project was to identify trends in smoking, the desire to quit smoking, and the desire to participate in smoking cessation courses in the general practitioner's office. METHODS: Patients completed a survey collecting demographic information, smoking behavior, presence of a chronic disease, desire to quit, and reasons for wanting to quit. RESULTS: Higher rates of smoking and lower rates of desired smoking cessation were noted. However, among patients considering smoking cessation, a relatively high number wanted smoking cessation courses. A higher number of failed quit attempts was an indication that both the likelihood of wanting to quit and the desire for quit classes would increase. Other predictors of the desire to complete and attend classes are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current research, physicians are encouraged to follow practice guidelines, survey smoking behavior of all patients, and assist in their smoking cessation efforts, particularly those who have previously been unsuccessful.",0,0,
789,Exploring the perspectives of nurses and patients regarding setting boundaries in a mental health forensic setting,"Boundary setting is an intervention commonly used by mental health care workers. However, setting limits is poorly designed, its purpose is unclear, and there are few evidence-based guidelines to help caregivers set limits in a safe and effective manner. What is known is that how caregivers set boundaries affects patients' perceptions of the interactions and their emotional and behavioral responses. In this qualitative study, 12 nurses and 12 patients participated in face-to-face, semi-structured interviews aimed at examining boundary setting and proposing principles for practice. The results suggest that: (i) setting boundaries is important for safety in psychiatric hospitals; (ii) empathetic patient involvement is required in setting boundaries (when caregivers engage empathetically, the therapeutic relationship is more likely to be sustained and the risk of aggressive responses is reduced);"" and (iii) an authoritative (fair, respectful , consistent and knowledgeable) rather than authoritarian (controlling and indifferent) Boundary style improves positive outcomes in terms of adherence, reduced likelihood of aggression, and maintenance of the therapeutic relationship Authoritarian interpersonal style Explaining the components of this style is critical to effective mental health nurse education and best practice, and to reducing aggressive responses to boundary setting.",0,0,
790,Exploring the feasibility of conjoint analysis as a tool to prioritize innovation for implementation,"Background In an era of scarce and competing implementation priorities, choosing what to implement is a key decision point for many behavior change projects. The values and attitudes of the professionals and managers involved inevitably influence the priority of decision options. Recording such values reliably is a challenge. Methods This paper presents an approach to capturing and incorporating professional values in prioritizing health innovations to be considered for adoption. Conjoint Analysis (CA) was used in a single UK Primary Care Trust to measure the priorities of healthcare professionals working with women with postnatal depression. Assessment-based CA data was collected using a questionnaire and then assigned to 12 interventions considered as a means of improving the management of postnatal depression. Findings The ""patient care impact"" and ""quality of evidence"" associated with the potential innovations were the most influential in shaping the priorities. Professionals were least influenced by whether an innovation was an established national or local priority or whether current practice in the Trust met minimum standards. Ranking the 12 innovations by potential adopter preferences found that ¡Â®guided self-help¡Â¯ was the top priority for implementation and ¡®screening questions for postnatal depression¡Â¯ the least. When other factors were considered (such as the existence of routine data or planned implementation activities elsewhere in the Trust), the project team chose to combine the eight related treatments and implement them as a single innovation, dubbed ¡ÂPsychological Therapies will. A. Conclusions Using conjoint analysis to prioritize potential innovation implementation options is a viable means to capture stakeholder benefits and thus increase the chances that an innovation will be adopted. There are some practical obstacles that need to be overcome, such as: B. Increasing response rates on collaborative surveys before routine and unevaluated use of this technique should be considered.",0,1,
791,Investigating the gap between knowledge and behavior: a qualitative study of clinical action after an educational intervention,"PURPOSE: Many medical education interventions improve clinician knowledge but do not change behavior. The authors uncovered this gap between knowledge and behavior through standardized clinical interactions, allowing for an in-depth study of the contributing factors. METHOD: A typical evidence-based educational intervention in a clinical setting (early signs of autism) was delivered to resident physicians at the University of Toronto in 2001-02, and change in knowledge was assessed by a multiple-choice test. Six to eight weeks later, the participants' relevant knowledge was documented and their clinical behavior was observed in four interactions with standardized patients. Factors causing a discrepancy between knowledge and behavior were then examined using semi-structured interviews that were tape-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory methods. RESULTS: Half of the participants showed varying degrees of knowledge-behavior gaps. Eight major rationalizations (relationships, patient agenda, knowledge deficits, clinical style, means to an end, ideals, autism stigma, and system barriers) were used to justify clinical behavior choices, and the same rationalizations were used to justify opposing behavioral choices. Two conditions have been identified that promote knowledge-based clinical action (level of certainty and sense of urgency). CONCLUSION: The knowledge-behaviour gap was revealed and factors influencing clinicians' decision to implement new knowledge were identified. That identical rationalizations were used to justify opposite behaviors implies that these factors may not be behavioral determinants. The sense of urgency and level of certainty encourages clinical action based on knowledge"";"" Focusing on these can increase the impact of education on practice.",0,0,
792,Exploring the roots of unintended security threats associated with the deployment of e-prescribing systems in hospitals and strategies to avoid and/or mitigate candidates: a qualitative study,"Objective Hospital electronic prescribing systems (ePrescribing) offer a variety of patient safety benefits. However, like other health informatics interventions in hospitals, they can also introduce new areas of risk. Despite recent advances in identifying these risks, the development and use of ePrescription systems still leads to numerous unintended consequences that can undermine improvements and jeopardize patient safety. These negative consequences must be analyzed when designing, implementing and using these systems. Our goal was therefore to understand the roots of these reported threats and identify potential avoidance/mitigation strategies. Methods We analyzed a qualitative longitudinal study of the implementation and introduction of ePrescription systems in six English hospitals, each designed as a case study. The data included semi-structured interviews, observations of implementation meetings and system usage, and a collection of relevant documents. We analyzed data first within and then across the case studies. Results Our dataset comprised 214 interviews, 24 observations and 18 documents. We have developed a taxonomy of factors underlying unintended security threats, in: (1) suboptimal system design, including lack of support for complex medication administration regimens, lack of effective integration between different systems, and lack of effective automated decision support tools""; (2) inappropriate usage of systems - particularly over-reliance on the system and the introduction of workarounds;"" and (3) sub-optimal implementation strategies resulting from partial rollouts/dual systems and lack of adequate training. We have identified a number of systems and organizational strategies that address these Risks could potentially be avoided or reduced Conclusions Imperfections in the design, implementation and use of ePrescription systems can lead to unintended consequences, including security risks Hospitals and suppliers must implement short- and long-term strategies in technical and organizational terms to minimize unintended security risks.",0,0,
793,"External validity of randomized controlled trials: ""To whom do the results of this study apply?""","When making treatment decisions, physicians and patients must consider relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. Relevance depends on external validity (or generalizability), ie whether the results can be meaningfully applied to a definable group of patients in a specific clinical setting in routine practice. Clinicians are concerned that external validity is often poor, particularly for some pharmaceutical industry studies, a perception that has led to underutilization of effective treatments. Yet researchers, funding agencies, ethics committees, the pharmaceutical industry, medical journals, and government regulators alike neglect external validity, leaving clinicians to make judgments. However, the reporting of the determinants of external validity in study publications and systematic reviews is usually inadequate. This review discusses these determinants, presents a checklist for clinicians, and makes recommendations for giving more consideration to external validity in the design and reporting of RCTs.",0,0,

795,Faculty Surveys: Using Vignettes to Examine Professional Judgment.,"Decision-making is becoming an increasingly central feature of social work practice, yet there is limited research on the subject. Experimental methods of studying decision-making are typically limited by practical and ethical difficulties, while questions of validity and generalizability concern ethnographic and other descriptive methods. It is argued here that factorial survey addresses these methodological difficulties as a research design to study how professionals make decisions in real life. In this research design, real-life vignettes (case scenarios or paper cases) are presented to social workers or other staff to make a judgment about a known type of scenario. The randomized factors within the vignettes, combined with the randomization of the selection of vignettes for each decision maker, give factorial survey, as opposed to the more common factorial experiment, a unique ability to examine the effect of multiple factors in complex decisions. The method is explained and perspectives and questions for the development of this research design for researching professional judgment in social work are discussed. Factorial survey has potential as a method to rigorously study the influence of client, family, and context factors on social worker and social worker decisions.

796,Factors affecting the feasibility and acceptability of a practice-based educational intervention in support of evidence-based prescribing: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Inappropriate and costly GP prescriptions are a major problem for primary care trusts. Awareness-raising in practice, as well as other measures such as audit and feedback, have the potential to make GP prescribing more evidence-based. High GP prescription costs are associated with GPs visiting pharmaceutical company representatives; tend to end consultations with prescriptions;"" and ""try out"" new drugs on an ""ad hoc basis"" and use this as evidence of the drug's effect. To address these and other educational needs, an educational intervention called developed “reflective practice.” The design of the intervention was informed by studies that have identified the prerequisites for successful behavior change in general practice.OBJECTIVES: The study examined the following: (i) Is it feasible for GPs to attend the sessions that included in the pedagogical intervention? (ii) Is the intervention acceptable to the participants and the session leaders? (iii) What are the barriers to the group building processes and how can these be overcome? METHODS: Four practices were recruited in South West England, all of which had problems with the appropriateness and cost of the prescription Lessons (including a videotaped scenario) were conducted in each of these exercises, and qualitative methods were used to examine the participants' complex attitudes and behaviors. A researcher observed and taped sessions at each practice. At the end of the program, a sample of doctors and all moderators were asked about their experiences. The recorded data were transcribed and analyzed using standard qualitative methods. RESULTS: Physicians in the largest partnerships had the most difficulty attending the sessions. Elsewhere, physicians were reluctant to get involved, given their previous experience of top-down management initiatives to prescribe quality. The presenters came from a wide range of professional backgrounds. While knowledge of issues related to the management of prescribed medicines was important, the professional background of the facilitator was less important than group facilitation skills in order to create a group process that the participating GPs found satisfactory. The videotaped scenario proved useful in staging the discussion. Maintaining the anonymity of the GPs' responses in the early stages of the sessions was important to ensure honesty in the discussion. Reaching consensus on how to treat common conditions has sometimes been difficult, partly because the use of the term ""best buy"" implies economic pressures rather than patient benefits, and partly because of the value that general practitioners attach to the concept of clinical attribute autonomy. Reflective practice seemed to have the potential to make GPs aware of the link that needs to be made between their clinical management decisions and the evidence of the British National Formulary and Clinical Evidence. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the importance of adequately preparing practice, including providing protected time for all GPs to participate in the training intervention. Scenarios and the structure of the sessions need to make the links between everyday practice and published evidence of effectiveness clearer. Emphasizing cost-effectiveness can be counterproductive and broader benefits need to be emphasized. We also identified the skill profile of the facilitator role. Our study points to the need for a clearer understanding of primary care physicians' perceptions of clinical autonomy and how this conflicts with the goal of agreeing on treatment guidelines for practice.

797,Factors associated with nursing interventions to reduce incontinence in hospitalized older adults,"INTRODUCTION: The problem of incontinence in elderly hospitalized patients is rarely documented, and there is little research determining why caregivers do or do not help with this problem. Are hospital nurses' attitudes and beliefs about incontinence related to their perceived ability to help the patient with the problem? What do hospital nurses know about causes and measures related to incontinence? METHODS: Two vignettes, one describing a patient with stress urinary incontinence and one describing a patient with urge urinary incontinence, were created. Questions were developed that measured variables of a support model, and nurses were asked to mark on a Likert scale when answering each question. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty respondents, along with three nursing professionals, returned completed questionnaires. Many hospital nurses believed that incontinence was temporary and part of aging. As a group, they had a more positive attitude towards intervention for urge urinary incontinence and believed that the doctor and their nurse expected them to help the patient with urge urinary incontinence. Respondents tended to believe that the patient was the least likely to expect help. Regarding the possibility of providing help for stress or urge incontinence, the opinions of those surveyed were evenly divided. Less than half of nurses correctly listed causes and interventions for stress or urge incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Other clinical problems that are perceived as more pressing and a lack of knowledge about appropriate supportive measures impair nurses' perception of opportunities to intervene when elderly hospitalized patients are incontinent. Assessment and intervention are essential to quality nursing care. Basic nursing education and ongoing staff education about incontinence are critical if assessments and interventions are to be accurate. Patients, as consumers of healthcare, need to be better informed about incontinence and make the choice to have the problem treated during the hospital stay. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Clinical Practice Guidelines is an important recommended reference.",0,0,

799,Failure of computer-assisted treatment suggestions to improve health outcomes in outpatients with uncomplicated hypertension: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"study objective. Assessing the impact of evidence-based treatment proposals for hypertension made to physicians and pharmacists using a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Design. Randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design of physician and pharmacist interventions, resulting in four patient groups: physician intervention only, pharmacist intervention only, physician and pharmacist intervention, and neither physician nor pharmacist intervention (control). Setting. Academic family doctor practice for internal medicine. Subjects. Seven hundred and twelve patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Measurements and main results. The suggestions were shown to doctors at computer workstations to create outpatient prescriptions and to pharmacists when filling out prescriptions. The primary endpoint was overall health-related quality of life. Secondary endpoints were symptom profile and side effects of antihypertensive drugs, number of emergency department visits and hospital admissions, blood pressure measurements, patient satisfaction with physicians and pharmacists, adherence to drug therapy, and healthcare costs. In the control group, 26% of the patients observed the implementation of care changes in accordance with treatment suggestions. In the intervention groups, compliance with suggestions was poor, with treatment suggestions being implemented in 25% of patients for whom suggestions were shown to pharmacists only, 29% of patients for whom suggestions were shown only to physicians, and 35% of the group for whom both Physicians as well as pharmacists received suggestions (p=0.13). Differences between groups were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant for overall health-related quality of life, symptom and adverse reaction profiles, number of emergency department visits and hospital stays, blood pressure measurements, fees, or drug therapy adherence. Conclusion. Computer-assisted intervention using a sophisticated electronic physician order entry system did not improve adherence to treatment recommendations or outcomes in patients with uncomplicated hypertension.",0,1,
800,Fall prevention in acute care hospitals: a randomized study.,"Context Falls cause injury and death in people of all ages, but the risk of falls increases significantly with age. Hospitalization further increases risk, but there is no evidence to support short-term hospital-based fall prevention strategies to reduce patient falls. Aim To study whether a Fall Prevention Toolkit (FPTK) using Health Information Technology (HIT) reduces the falls of patients in hospitals. Design, setting, and patient cluster randomized study conducted January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2009 comparing fall rates of patients at 4 metropolitan US hospitals in units receiving usual care (4 units and 5104 patients) or the intervention (4 units and 5160 patients). Intervention The FPTK integrated existing communication and work processes into the HIT application. Based on a valid fall risk rating scale filled out by a nurse, the FPTK software adjusted fall prevention interventions to account for the specific determinants of patients' fall risk. The FPTK produced bedside posters consisting of short text with an accompanying symbol, patient education handouts, and care plans, all of which conveyed patient-specific warnings to key stakeholders. Main Outcome Parameters The primary objective was patient falls per 1000 patient-days, adjusted for site and patient care unit. A secondary endpoint was fall-related injuries. Results During the 6-month intervention period, the number of patients with falls differed between control (n = 87) and intervention (n = 67) units (P = 0.02). Site-adjusted fall rates were significantly higher in control units (4.18 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.45-5.06] per 1,000 patient-days) than in intervention units (3.15 [95% CI, 2.54-3, 90] per 1,000 patients). -days""; P=0.04).

801,Requests from family members for extension of physiological support after determination of brain death: a case series analysis and proposed guidelines for clinical management,"We describe and analyze 13 cases processed by our Ethics Advisory Service (ECS) in which families requested continuation of physiological support for loved ones after death had been declared using neurological criteria (DNC). These ethics consultations took place between 2005 and 2013. The age of the patients ranged from 14 to 85 years. Continued mechanical ventilation was the key intervention sought by all families. The ECS's advice and recommendations generally encouraged ""appropriate accommodation"" of the requests by balancing compassion for grieving families with other ethical and moral concerns such as resource stewardship, professional integrity, and moral suffering. In cases that we characterized as arrangements with finite goals, a “reasonable accommodation” strategy proved effective in balancing the interests and goals of those involved and enabling steady progress toward a resolution. When a family directly objected to a DNC declaration and requested an indefinite accommodation, the “reasonable accommodation” approach offered little practical guidance to physicians and a resolution required definitive action by either the family or the clinical team. Based on our analysis and reflections on these 13 cases, we propose ethically justifiable and practical guidance to support healthcare professionals, administrators and ECSs facing similar cases.",0,0,
802,Family-based interventions to increase physical activity in children: a meta-analysis and realistic synthesis protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven association between physical activity and health, data suggest that many children are underactive and that levels decline into adolescence. Involving the family in interventions can increase and maintain children's physical activity levels at the critical juncture prior to secondary school. The synthesis of existing evidence will inform future studies, but the heterogeneity of the target populations recruited, the behavior modification techniques and intervention strategies employed, and the measurements taken may require a multifaceted verification methodology. Therefore, the primary goal of this work will be to summarize evidence from intervention studies that explicitly involve the family unit to increase physical activity in children by using an innovative dual meta-analysis and a realistic approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Peer-reviewed studies are independently reviewed for inclusion by two authors based on (1) including ""healthy"" participants aged 5-12 years"";"" (2) have a substantive intervention goal of increasing physical activity by involving the family, and (3) report on physical activity. The duplicate data extraction and quality assessment is performed using a specially designed form or quality assessment tool of the Effective Public Health Practice Project. STATA software is used to calculate effect sizes for meta-analyses, performing subgroup analysis to identify moderating traits. Realistic syntheses are carried out according to RAMESES quality and publication guidelines, including the development of a program theory and evidence mapping. DISSEMINATION: This review will be the first to use a traditional review framework to perform a dual meta-analysis and realistic synthesis and examine interventions that involve the family to increase physical activity in children. Findings are disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conferences, formal presentations to policymakers and practitioners, and informal meetings. The evidence generated from this synthesis will also be used to inform the development of theory-guided, evidence-based interventions aimed at involving the family to increase physical activity levels in children.

804,Rapidly tracing the design of theory-based KT interventions through a consensus process,"BACKGROUND: Despite available evidence for optimal management of spinal pain, poor adherence to guidelines and large disparities in healthcare remain. One of the goals of the Canadian Chiropractic Guideline Initiative is to develop and evaluate targeted theory- and evidence-based interventions to improve chiropractor management of non-specific neck pain. To systematically develop a knowledge translation (KT) intervention underpinned by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), we examined the factors influencing the use of multimodal care to treat nonspecific neck pain and domain-assigned key theories to behavior modification techniques. METHODS: One-on-one telephone interviews were conducted with a targeted sample of 13 chiropractors, examining beliefs about coping with neck pain. The interview guide was based on the TDF. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and evaluated by two independent experts using thematic content analysis. A 15-person panel of experts formally met to design a KT intervention. RESULTS: Nine TDF domains were identified as likely relevant. Key beliefs (and relevant areas of the TDF) included the following: influence of formal education, peers, and patients on clinicians (social influences), availability of educational materials (environmental context and resources), and better clinical outcomes that support the use of multimodal procedures reinforce caring (reinforcement). Supporting factors considered important included better communication (skills), audits of patients' treatment-related outcomes (behavioural regulation), awareness and compliance with guidelines (knowledge);"" and tailoring of multimodal care (memory, attention, and decision-making processes). Clinicians mediated conflicting beliefs about perceived threats to professional autonomy (social/professional role and identity) and the speed of recovery by applying or ignoring the practice recommendations (beliefs about consequences).The expert panel mapped behavior modification techniques to important theoretical areas and identified relevant KT Strategies and modes of delivery to increase the use of multimodal care among chiropractors CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted KT educational intervention has been developed that targets the management of neck pain d targeted by chiropractors. The KT intervention consisted of an online educational webinar series, clinical vignettes, and a video underpinned by the short action planning model. The intervention was designed to reflect key theoretical areas, behavior change techniques, and intervention components. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention has yet to be tested.",0,0,
805,Feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based implementation strategies for psychotherapists implementing cognitive behavioral therapy: a pilot study informing a randomized controlled trial,"Background Informed by our previous work suggesting that therapists do not feel recognized or rewarded for implementing evidence-based practices, we tested the feasibility and acceptability of two incentive-based implementation strategies aimed at increasing therapist adherence to cognitive behavioral therapy for improve youth. an evidence-based practice. Methods This study was conducted over 6 weeks in two community mental health facilities with therapists (n?=?11) and leaders (n?=?4). Therapists were randomized to receive either a financial or social incentive if they met a predetermined criterion for adherence to cognitive behavioral therapy. In the first phase of the intervention (Block 1; 2 weeks), therapists received the reward originally randomized to them if they met the criterion. In the second intervention phase (Block 2; 2 weeks), therapists received both rewards if they met the criterion. The therapists recorded 41 sessions with 15 individual clients during the project period. The primary endpoints included feasibility and acceptability. The feasibility was evaluated quantitatively. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with therapists and leaders to assess acceptability. As an exploratory result, the difference in therapist adherence depending on the condition was examined. Adherence scores were determined using an established and validated observational coding system of cognitive behavioral therapy. Results Both implementation strategies were feasible and acceptable - however, study design changes will be required for the larger study based on participant feedback. Regarding our exploratory analysis, we found a trend suggesting that financial reward had a stronger effect on therapist loyalty than social reward. Conclusions Incentive-based implementation strategies can be implemented in community mental health settings with good acceptance, although iterative piloting is essential. Larger, full-fledged studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of implementation strategies to encourage therapists to adhere to and improve on evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy.",1,1,
806,Feasibility and impact of a computer-assisted clinical decision support system on assessment and initial management of new onset chest pain: a mixed-methods study,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can modify clinical behavior, but the factors that influence their action are still poorly understood. This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of a CDSS to support diagnosis and treatment decisions in patients with suspected stable angina. METHODS: Intervention The Optimizing Management of Angina (OMA) program includes a lead CDSS assessment and medication decisions for physicians treating patients with emerging stable angina based on English national guidelines introduced through an educational intervention. Design and participants A mixed methods study i. A study of outcomes in patients with suspected angina in three chest pain clinics in England before and after the introduction of the OMA programme. ii. Observations of clinical processes, interviews and a focus group with healthcare professionals in two chest pain clinics after implementation of the OMA program. RESULTS: Medication and cardiovascular imaging studies performed within six months of presentation and their compliance with CDSS recommendations. Thematic analysis of qualitative data to understand how the CDSS was used. RESULTS: Data from 285 patients attending chest pain clinics were analyzed: 106 before and 179 after the OMA program. 40 consultations were observed, 5 clinicians were interviewed, and a post-intervention focus group was held. The proportion of patients eligible for diagnostic testing who received one was 50% (95 CI 34-66%) of pre-OMA patients and 59% (95 CI 48-70%) of post-OMA patients. Despite the high use of the CDSS (84% of consultations), observations and interviews revealed difficulties in entering data into the CDSS and structural and practical barriers to its use. In most cases, the CDSS was not used for real-time decision making, but was only consulted after the patient left the room. CONCLUSIONS: The OMA CDSS for the treatment of chest pain is not feasible in its current form. The CDSS was not used to support individual patient care decisions. A number of barriers to using the CDSS have been identified, some of which can be easily addressed, such as: e.g., under-assessment of cardiovascular risk, while others are more deeply embedded in current practice, e.g. B. the unavailability of some tests or no prescribing privileges for nurses.",0,1,
807,Feasibility of Conducting a Randomized Controlled Trial of Elementary Health in Children Diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Underserved Communities,"AIM: Elementary Health (TMH), the use of video teleconferencing to deliver care services that are typically delivered in person, is increasingly being used to address inequalities in access to care. However, few studies have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMH as a service delivery model. The Children's Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Elemental Health Treatment Study (CATTS) is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of TMH conducted in multiple underserved communities. This article reports on the feasibility of an efficacy study of TMH in children. METHODS: The CATTS study used video conference calls to provide guideline-based care and secure websites to coordinate important aspects of study delivery, such as: RESULTS: The CATTS study involved seven communities and 150 primary care physicians as study partners and included 223 children aged 5.5 to 12.9 years. The intervention group completed an average of 5.3 out of 6.0 scheduled sessions and 96% of the control group completed a TMH consultation. Both groups completed an average of 4.8 of the 5.0 assessments. Clinicians demonstrated high fidelity to their treatment protocols. Minor technical difficulties did not affect the supply. CONCLUSIONS: The CATTS study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting an RCT of TMH with children living in multiple underserved communities. Telecommunication technologies can facilitate the coordination of research activities across sites and clinicians. Future studies should work closely with study partners to ensure referral of a representative study sample. Further studies are needed to establish the effectiveness of TMH as a model for service delivery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00830700.",0,0,

We tested the feasibility and acceptability of a modified PACE program with Australian General Practitioners (GPs) and measured its impact on self-reported counseling behavior in a pilot study. Recruitment was through a local GP department. Twenty-five GPs completed two PACE Australia workshops that included pediatric asthma management in line with Australian Asthma Guidelines and focused on effective communication strategies. Feasibility, usefulness and perceived benefits of the program were measured by questionnaires before the workshop and one month later, and by an evaluation questionnaire after each workshop. GP were consistently enthusiastic and supported the workshops. The most useful items they reported were communication skills, case studies, device demonstrations and the toolkit provided. GP self-reports of perceived helpfulness of key communication strategies and their confidence in their use and reported frequency of use increased significantly after the workshops. The PACE program shows promise in improving the way Australian GPs manage asthma consultations, particularly in terms of doctor-patient communication. The impact of the modified PACE Australia program on the processes and outcomes of primary care for children with asthma will now be measured in a randomized controlled trial.",0,0,

810,Feedback as a behavior change strategy: The devil is in the details,"BACKGROUND: Performance feedback is one of several strategies to improve clinical practice among students and physicians. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper was to examine conceptual foundations and essential components for audit and feedback strategies, assess the extent to which recently published audit and feedback interventions incorporate these components, and recommend future directions for feedback to improve its educational and behavioral impact . METHODS: Based on the actionable feedback model, we examined the presence of four theoretical constructs - timeliness, individualization, lack of punishment, and adaptability - in studies published between 2009 and 2010 that included a feedback intervention. RESULTS: There were large differences in the definition, implementation, and outcomes of ""feedback"" interventions, making comparison between studies difficult. None of the studies we reviewed included all of the components of the actionable feedback model. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback interventions reported to date, even when the outcomes are positive, often do not include concepts of behavior change. This can partly explain the large differences in the approaches and outcomes of such interventions and poses major challenges for the repetition of a given intervention. If feedback processes are to be used, disseminated and implemented successfully, there needs to be some standardization and certainly more clarity in the specific ones Action steps for applying behavior theory in practice.",0,1,

The purpose of this review is to highlight the current literature from April 2005 to September 2006 with treatment options. RECENT RESULTS: Previous evidence suggests that medication and self-treatment approaches can improve symptoms, functioning and well-being in this patient population. Recent studies examining the effectiveness of two serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors - duloxetine and milnacipran - and the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin are encouraging. Studies evaluating different forms of exercise continue to support the belief that increased physical activity is an essential part of any treatment plan for patients with fibromyalgia. Three studies contributed to the understanding of treatment adherence. Finally, three studies evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating fibromyalgia showed conflicting results, but added the knowledge doctors need to have substantive conversations with patients. SUMMARY: Recent studies support the recommendation of a multimodal treatment approach with individualized, evidence-based pharmacotherapy and self-management. Treatment goals should include improving symptoms, particularly pain and sleep, and promoting positive health behaviors with the goal of improving physical function and emotional well-being.",0,0,

815,First episode psychosis: a window of opportunity for best practices,"Patients experiencing a first psychotic episode or early stages of psychosis pose important diagnostic problems for clinicians. At the time of the first episode of psychosis, it is crucial that physicians select the most effective treatment option, as prompt intervention offers the best chance of containing the disease. During this time, it is also important to choose the best treatment option, since dysfunction occurs most rapidly in this early phase, which can affect the patient's future prognosis, the extent of necessary treatment, and morbidity. Although research has shown a decrease in brain gray matter for those who develop psychosis, along with signs of functional impairment, many patients with psychosis remain untreated for long periods of time and do not seek medical attention because of reluctance, fear of stigma have or do not recognize the problem or complexity of their care system. Previous studies have shown that if psychosis is left untreated, patient outcomes are poorer than in a patient treated earlier in the disease course. There are a number of treatment options for treating psychosis, including the use of first- or second-generation antipsychotics. Clinicians should note that both drug types are associated with certain side effects, such as: B. tardive dyskinesia or weight gain. For both types of drugs, doses should be lower in patients with a first psychotic episode than in patients with chronic psychosis. Finally, patients may have various comorbidities such as B. Substance abuse, which can also affect treatment. This expert roundtable supplement addresses the diagnosis and treatment selection for initial episodes of psychosis and comorbidities associated with the disorder.

METHODS: This prospective intervention study was conducted at Maccabi Healthcare Services, a preferred provider organization that has used a computerized medical record since 1992. We examined the data of 865 general practitioners over 3 years. In May 2005 we changed the order form and reduced the number of tests that can be ordered via a checkbox form from 51 to 26. 27 tests were removed from the form and two tests were added. The total number of laboratory test orders and the median rate of test orders per physician visit during each study period were calculated for each test separately. RESULTS: Tests added to the computerized laboratory order form showed a 60.7% increase in the first year and a further 90% increase the following year. For the unchanged tests, the percentage changes over the same time periods were +18.4% and -22.4%. For the deleted tests, the change was -27% and -19.2% for the respective years. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the format of laboratory test order forms can alter the ordering of physician tests and be useful along with other interventions to improve laboratory test adequacy. A well-designed test order form can strengthen clinical guidelines for conducting some preventive tests and follow-up visits.",1,1,
817,Formative evaluation of practice changes to treat depression within a shared care model in primary care,"Objective To study the implementation and initial impact of the Physician Integrated Network (PIN) mental health indicators specific to the screening and management of follow-up care for depression in three primary shared mental health care practices in Manitoba. BACKGROUND: Manitoba Health conducted a primary care renewal initiative called PIN in 2006, which involved the development of mental health indicators specifically for screening and managing follow-up care for depression. These indicators have been implemented at three PIN group practice centers in Manitoba, which are also part of Shared Mental Health Care. Methods: The design was a non-experimental longitudinal design. A formative evaluation examined the implementation and initial impact of the mental health indicators using mixed methods (document review, survey and interview). Quantitative data were examined with descriptive and comparative statistics and a content and topic analysis of the qualitative interviews was carried out. Survey responses were received from 32 out of 36 physicians at the three sites. Interviews were conducted with 15 providers. Findings This evaluation illustrated providers' perceived attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors related to identifying and treating depression and expanded our understanding of primary care processes related to managing depression in the context of implementing a new initiative. Depression is recognized as an important problem in primary care practice that is time consuming to diagnose, treat and treat and requires further investigation. Implementation of the mental health PIN indicators varied by location and provider. Use of the indicators increased over time and there was a general consensus that the benefits of screening outweighed the costs"";"" However, the usefulness of screening for depression remains unclear. Consistent with current guidelines, the results of this review raise the question of whether there are more effective ways of influencing depression in primary care than screening.",0,0,
818,Promoting the translation of research into practice in healthcare: a consolidated framework for advancing the science of implementation,"Background Many interventions that have been shown to be effective in health care studies do not translate into meaningful patient care outcomes across multiple contexts. Healthcare researchers recognize the need to assess not only summative outcomes but also formative outcomes to assess the extent to which implementation in a given setting is effective, prolongs sustainability, and promotes dissemination in other settings. Many implementation theories have been published to promote effective implementation. However, they overlap significantly in the constructs embodied in individual theories, and a comparison of the theories shows that each lacks important constructs embodied in other theories. In addition, terminology and definitions are not consistent across the theories. We describe the Consolidated Framework For Implementation Research (CFIR), which provides an overarching typology to encourage the development of implementation theory and the review of what works, where, and why in multiple contexts. Methods We used a snowball sampling approach to identify published theories that were evaluated to derive constructs based on strength of conceptual or empirical support for impact on implementation, consistency in definitions, agreement with our own evidence, and measurement capabilities identify. We combined constructs across published theories that had different labels but were redundant or overlapped in definition, and we analyzed constructs that mixed underlying concepts. Findings The CFIR consists of five main areas: intervention characteristics, external environment, internal environment, characteristics of the people involved and the implementation process. Eight constructs were identified in relation to the intervention (e.g. strength and quality of evidence), four constructs were identified in relation to the external environment (e.g. patient needs and resources), 12 constructs were identified in relation to the internal environment (e.g. culture, leadership engagement) five constructs related to individual characteristics and eight constructs related to the process (e.g. planning, evaluating and reflecting) were identified. We present explicit definitions for each construct. Conclusion The CFIR provides a pragmatic structure for dealing with complex, interacting, multi-level, and transient states of real-world constructs by incorporating, consolidating, and unifying key constructs from published implementation theories. It can be used to guide formative evaluations and build the knowledge base for implementation across multiple studies and settings.",0,0,
819,Founders and recurrent CDH1 mutations in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer,"Background Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is caused by germline mutations in the epithelial cadherin (CDH1) gene and is characterized by an increased risk of diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. Objective To determine whether recurrent germline CDH1 mutations occurred as a result of independent mutational events or common ancestry. Design, setting and patients Thirty-eight families diagnosed with clinically hereditary diffuse gastric cancer were enrolled between November 2004 and January 2006 and analyzed for CDH1 mutations in an ongoing British Columbia Cancer Agency study. 26 families had at least 2 cases of gastric cancer, including 1 case of diffuse gastric cancer in a person under 50 years"";"" In 12 families, either a single case of diffuse gastric cancer in a person younger than 35 years of age or multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer in people older than 50 years were diagnosed. Main outcome measures Classification of family members as carriers or non-carriers of CDH1 mutations. Haplotype analysis to assess recurring mutations for common ancestors was performed on 7 families from this study and 7 previously reported families with the same mutations. Results Thirteen mutations (6 new) were identified in 15 of the 38 families (40% detection rate). The 1137G>A splicing mutation and the 1901C>T (A634V) missense/splicing mutation occurred in common haplotypes in 2 families but in different haplotypes in a third family. The 2195G>A (R732Q) missense/splicing mutation occurred in 2 families with different haplotypes. The 2064-2065delTG mutation occurred in a common haplotype in 2 families. Two families from this study plus two other families carrying the novel 2398delC mutation shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. All 4 families are from the southeast coast of Newfoundland. Based on the concentrations of lobular breast cancer cases, 2 branches of this family were diagnosed with hereditary breast cancer and tested for BRCA mutations. Within these 4 families, the cumulative risk at age 75 in mutation carriers for clinically detected gastric cancer was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-91%) for males and 63% (95% CI, 19%-99% ) for females and the risk of breast cancer in female mutation carriers was 52% (95% CI, 29% - 94%). Conclusions Recurrent CDH1 mutations in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer are due to both independent mutational events and common ancestors. The presence of a founder mutation from Newfoundland is strongly supported.",0,0,

821,Framework for quality improvement of pharmacy services - a bridge to bridge the quality gap. Part I. The Opportunity and the Tool,"OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on quality improvement principles and methodologies applied to pharmacy services and provide a framework for current and future efforts to improve quality of pharmacy services and effective drug therapy management. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy produced the Catalog of Pharmacy Quality Indicators in 1997, followed by the Summary of National Pharmacy Quality Measures in February 1999. In April 2002, AMCP introduced the Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management in the 21st Century. The framework documents include a self-assessment tool that describes more than 250 specific “components” that describe roles, behaviors, skills, roles, duties, and responsibilities that help meet client expectations for effective drug therapy management. RESULTS: There are many opportunities to improve the quality of clinical, service and cost outcomes associated with drug therapy management. These may include: patient safety, incidence of medical errors, adverse drug reactions, patient compliance, achievement of target blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels, risk reduction for adverse cardiac events and osteoporosis-related fractures, patient satisfaction, risk of hospitalization or mortality; and cost of care Healthcare professionals can measure improvements in quality of care in a variety of ways, including (a) better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) same patient outcome at a lower cost, (c) better patient outcome at a lower cost, or (d) significantly better Patient outcome at moderately higher cost Measurement enables effective management A framework of component factors (e.g. tasks) is necessary to facilitate changes in the key processes and critical factors affecting individual physicians and healthcare systems h helping to meet customer expectations for drug therapy, thereby improving those outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Health service quality improvement in the United States will occur in incremental changes based on a structure-process-outcome model. The structure is provided by evidence derived from controlled randomized trials and other studies of care and systems outcomes based on the scientific method. The process portion is created through the application of evidence in the form of clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice models and self-assessment tools such as the Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management. Incremental changes in structure and process will lead to the desirable outcome of meeting customer needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.",0,0,
822,Framework options as choice or opportunity: does the framework influence decisions?,"objective. Healthcare professionals must enable patients to make informed decisions about healthcare choices by presenting all options with an open mind. This study examined whether presenting the decision as an ""opportunity"" rather than a ""choice"" affected individuals' preferences related to study participation for cancer treatment. methods. Self-selecting healthy females (N=124) were randomly assigned to the following decision frames: opportunity to participate in the study (opt-in), opportunity to be excluded from the study (opt-out), and opportunity to have standard treat or participate in the study (choice). The computer-based task required the women to make a hypothetical decision about a real cancer treatment study. The software presented the framed scenario, recorded initial preference, presented comprehensive and balanced information, tracked participants' use of information during decision-making, and recorded the final decision. A post-task paper questionnaire assessed perceived risk, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and satisfaction with the decision. Results. Framing influenced women's immediate preferences. Frameworks of opportunity, whether opt-in or opt-out, introduced bias as they discouraged women from opting into standard treatment. By using the marquee, this distortion was avoided. The opt-out opportunity framework also had an impact on women's perceived social norm"";"" Women felt that others favored the trial option. The framing bias was gone after participants were able to view detailed information about the options in a patient decision support format. There were no group differences in information gathering and final decisions. 16 percent changed their initial preference after receiving complete information. Conclusions. A ""choice frame"" in which all treatment options are explicitly listed is less likely to influence preferences. Presenting complete information in parallel option-by-attribute format is likely to ""bias"" the decision framework. Tailoring information to initial preferences would not be advisable as preferences can change after detailed information.",0,1,

825,From clinical evidence to everyday practice: implementation of findings from a cost-benefit analysis of endoscopic injection therapy for gastrointestinal bleeding,"BACKGROUND: A previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding study showed that patients treated with repeated injections of fibrin glue for upper gastrointestinal bleeding had significantly less rebleeding than patients treated with polidocanol. AIM: To analyze the cost and effectiveness of repeated fibrin glue injections and whether these results are changing physician attitudes. DESIGN: A retrospective random sample of five hospitals from the previous study, collection of cost identification and follow-up data from 320 patients (155 in the polidocanol group, 165 in the fibrin glue group). METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and comparison of outcomes was performed using chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the five hospitals, a survey on the local guidelines for the management of ulcer bleeding was carried out using a questionnaire and the results were analyzed qualitatively. The measure of effectiveness is the number of postoperative bleedings prevented. Other variables included length of hospital stay and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The cost of preventing further rebleeding by repeated fibrin glue treatment is 14,316 +/- 4,981 euros (incremental cost-benefit ratio). There were no significant differences in the length of stay in the ICU or in the hospital. Doctors did not change their treatment plans for patients with upper GI bleeding. A survey found that other factors, such as local policies, attitudes toward new treatment options, and ease of use of medication, are more important in changing physician behavior than the outcome of a single study. CONCLUSIONS: The study was not designed to answer a pharmacoeconomic question. Since relevant variables (e.g. length of stay in the intensive care unit) could not be reliably determined retrospectively, this can lead to distorted estimates of the incremental cost-benefit ratio.",0,0,
826,From evidence to expertise: concordance in the topical treatment of psoriasis,"Vulgar psoriasis is an inflammatory cutaneous-systemic disease, chronic and intermittent. The etiology is undefined and there is a higher risk of comorbidities affecting patients' quality of life. The objectives of this study were to establish consistency between the Guia de Practica Clinica (GPC) of pharmacological treatment of plaque psoriasis and the clinical practice of a group of Mexican dermatologists, experts in the topical treatment of psoriasis"";"" and balancing interest and knowledge about quality of life and therapy adherence. A Delphi questionnaire was used among 30 experts to examine their therapeutic behavior and attitudes toward assessing quality of life and adherence to therapy. A subgroup meeting of 10 dermatologists was held to analyze the results. A second questionnaire was answered to distinguish the decisions made for topical treatment in institutional and private practice, as well as other items not examined in the first questionnaire. After analyzing the questionnaire results, it was clear that the data published in the Guia de Practica Clinica and the prescribing attitude of the experts regarding the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis are consistent. There is also agreement between the physicians in private and institutional medical care on the attitude to drug prescription, although vitamin D analogues and corticosteroids are more likely to be used in private practices and salicylic acid replaces corticosteroids in the facilities.",0,0,
827,From hypertension control to global cardiovascular risk management: an educational intervention in a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension management guidelines recommend adjusting therapeutic efforts according to global cardiovascular risk (CVR) and not just blood pressure readings. However, this paradigm shift has not yet arrived in German general practice. We evaluated the effect of an educational visit to general practitioners (GPs) and encouraged them to consider CVR in treatment decisions for patients with hypertension. METHODS: Prospective cluster-randomized study of 3443 patients with known hypertension treated by 87 general practitioners. Practices were randomly assigned to complex (A) or simple (B) interventions. Both groups received a guide by email"";"" Group A also received a complex peer intervention that promoted the concept of global CVR. Clinical data were collected at baseline and 6-9 months after the intervention. The main result was the improvement of the calculated CVR in the predefined subpopulation of patients with a high CVR (10-year mortality >/= 5%) but without overt cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Adjusted for baseline, the follow-up CVR was 13.1% (95% CI 12.6% - 13.6%) (A) and 12.6% (95% CI 12.2% - 13, 1%) (B) with a group difference (A vs. B) of 0.5% (-0.2%-1.1%), p=0.179. The group difference was -0.05% in patients from GPs familiar with global CVR and 1.1% in patients from GPs unfamiliar with global CVR. However, this effect modification was not significant (p = 0.165). Pooled across groups, the absolute reduction in CVR from baseline was 1.0%, p<0.001. The ICC was 0.026 (p=0.002). Hypertension control (BP < 140/90 mmHg) improved in the same subpopulation from 38.1 to 45.9% in the complex intervention group and from 35.6 to 46.5% in the simple intervention group, with adjusted follow-up control rates of 46.7% (95% CI 40.4%-53.1%) (A) and 46.9% (95% CI 40.3%-53.5% (B) and an adjusted odds ratio (A vs. B) of 0.99 (95% CI 0.68-1.45), p=0.966 CONCLUSIONS: Our complex educational intervention, including a clinical visit, had no significant effect on the CVR of Patients with known hypertension at high risk compared to simple postal intervention.",0,0,
828,From interdisciplinary to integrated care for the child with autism: the essential role for a code of ethics,"To address the developmental deficits of children with autism, several disciplines have come to the fore within intervention programs. These are speech therapists, psychologists/counsellors, occupational therapists/physiotherapists, special education teachers, behavior analysts and physicians/medical staff. As the field of autism therapy moves toward a more comprehensive, holistic, and interdisciplinary model, the complexity of an interdisciplinary model of service delivery could pose significant challenges. The difficulty in implementing this approach could result in underperforming programs being set up. Since integration between disciplines is a necessity, the ethical principles and language common to all contributing disciplines are argued as an appropriate integrative force. An overview of these principles and a draft code of ethics are offered to establish high standards and expectations for all participants in such a program.",0,0,

831,Functional recovery after myocardial infarction in men: The independent effects of social class,"Background: Social class has been repeatedly associated with cardiovascular disease and death, but no studies have examined the effect of social class on recovery after myocardial infarction. In addition, few studies have simultaneously assessed a wide range of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors that may influence health outcomes after myocardial infarction. Objective: To determine whether social class remains independently associated with functional recovery after myocardial infarction, even after controlling for clinical, demographic, and psychosocial factors known to influence post-infarction outcomes. DESIGN: Analysis of prospective data from a multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical study. Scope: 25 hospitals or clinical sites in the United States and Canada that participated in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial, including the health insurance substudy. Patients: 2145 males aged 29-69 years hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction who were recruited for the beta-blocker myocardial infarction study. Measures: The primary outcome was a change in New York Heart Association functional class between baseline assessment and 12 months after in farction, dichotomized as improved or not improved (ie, no change, decrease in at least one category, or death). Results: Social class maintained its independent effect on improved functional status even after controlling for relevant prognostic factors. Persons with a high social class had an improved functional status 1 year after the infarction significantly more frequently than persons with a lower or middle social class. Certain clinical, demographic, and psychosocial characteristics were associated with recovery, but the effect of social class could not be explained by these additional characteristics. Conclusions: Social class has a significant impact on recovery after myocardial infarction and may explain differences in clinical outcomes.",0,0,
832,Functional somatic syndromes,"The term functional somatic syndrome has been applied to several related syndromes characterized by symptoms, distress, and disability rather than consistently detectable tissue abnormalities. These syndromes include multiple chemical sensitivity, sick building syndrome, repetitive stress injuries, the side effects of silicone breast implants, Gulf War syndrome, chronic whiplash, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Patients with functional somatic syndromes have explicit and highly elaborate self-diagnoses, and their symptoms often defy reassurance, explanation, and standard treatment of symptoms. They share similar phenomenologies, high co-occurrence rates, similar epidemiological characteristics, and a higher than expected prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity. Although discrete pathophysiological causes may ultimately be found in some patients with functional somatic syndromes, the suffering of these patients is exacerbated by a self-perpetuating, self-affirming cycle in which common, endemic, somatic symptoms are falsely attributed to serious abnormalities, reflecting those of the Patient's belief that he or she has a serious illness. Four psychosocial factors drive this cycle of symptom amplification: the belief that one has a serious illness, the expectation that one's condition is likely to get worse, the ""sickness role"", including the implications of litigation and compensation; and the alarming portrayal of the condition as catastrophic and disabling. The climate surrounding functional somatic syndromes includes sensationalist media coverage, profound mistrust of medical expertise and physicians, the mobilization of parties with a vested interest in the status of functional somatic syndromes, litigation, and a clinical approach that overemphasizes the biomedical and ignores the psychosocial factors. All of these influences exacerbate and perpetuate the somatic burden of patients with functional somatic syndromes, increasing their fears and pessimistic expectations, prolonging their disability, and enhancing their ill role. A six-step strategy for supporting patients with functional somatic syndromes is presented here.",0,0,
833,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease,"Heartburn 2 or more days per week requires medical attention as patients are likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Chronic GERD can lead to the development of complications, including erosive esophagitis, stricture formation, and Barrett's esophagus, increasing the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. A trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the quickest and least expensive way to diagnose GERD and is at least as sensitive as 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring. Since PPIs only bind to actively secreting proton pumps, they should be administered 30 to 60 minutes before a meal. Despite these recommendations, a recent survey of over 1,000 primary care physicians in the US found that 36% instructed their patients to take a PPI with or after a meal, or did not tell when to take it. The patients who respond best to surgical therapy for GERD are those who have had clearly documented acid reflux with typical symptoms and who have responded to PPI treatment. Unfortunately, the same survey found that most doctors recommend antireflux surgery for patients who have failed medical therapy.",0,0,

835,Information search strategies of trainees in general medicine for clinical questions in daily practice,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that clinical questions are common among physicians. However, data on the information-seeking behavior of general practitioner trainees is sparse and the numbers examined are small. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine how often and how GP trainees search for answers to clinical questions they encounter in daily clinical practice. METHODS: On eight consecutive practice days, trainee general practitioners in their third year kept records of all patient contacts. Information was collected on patient contacts (description), clinical inquiries (frequency, type), search behavior (frequency, time, reason for not searching, resources used, duration of search), and responses (frequency, impact). Descriptive analyzes were performed"";"" Frequencies and percentages were calculated. We calculated the number of clinical queries per patient, the number of searches per query, and the number of responses per search. RESULTS: Seventy-six trainees reported 1533 clinical queries on 7300 patients with 7619 complaints [mean of 0.2 queries per patient, standard deviation (SD) 0.1]. For most questions, trainees tracked an answer (mean 0.8 per question, SD 0.2), mainly during counseling (61% of searches), and frequently retrieved answers (mean 0.8 per search, SD 0.17 ) reported improving clinical decision making accounted for 26%. The most common resources were colleagues or supervisors (28%) and national GP guidelines (26%). The median duration of a search was 4 minutes (interquartile range 3). CONCLUSION: GP trainees have one clinical inquiry for every five patients. They often attempted to find answers and reported success in most searches, largely through consultation with supervisors or peers and national GP guidelines.",0,0,
836,Primary care physician views on the determinants of testing regimen: a theory-based qualitative approach to developing an intervention to improve immunoglobulin requirements in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that variations in lab request patterns may indicate unnecessary test usage. Requirement patterns for serum immunoglobulins vary significantly between general practitioners (GPs). This study aims to examine primary care physicians' views on testing to identify the determinants of behavior and recommend feasible intervention strategies to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs who requested laboratory tests at Cork University Hospital or University Hospital Kerry in southern Ireland. GPs were identified from a Health Service Executive laboratory list of GPs in the Cork-Kerry area. A random sample of general practitioners (stratified according to GP inquiry patterns) was created from this list. General practitioners were specifically qualified according to the criteria of location (urban/rural)""; duration;"" selected. and exercise size (single-hand/group). The interviews were conducted between December 2014 and February 2015. The interviews were transcribed verbatim using NVivo 10 software and analyzed using the framework analysis method. New themes have been mapped to the Theory Domains Framework (TDF), which outlines 12 domains that may enable or inhibit behavior change. The Behavior Change Wheel and Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy were then used to identify potential intervention strategies. RESULTS: Sixteen general practitioners were interviewed (ten males and six females). The results suggest that intervention strategies should specifically target the key barriers to effective testing while considering the context of primary care practice. Seven domains from the TDF were found to influence immunoglobulin test ordering behavior and identified as ""mechanisms for change"" (knowledge, environmental context and resources, social/professional role and identity, beliefs about ability, beliefs about consequences, memory, attention, and Decision). -manufacturing processes and behavioral regulation). Using these TDF domains, seven BCTs emerged as feasible “intervention content” to address GP ordering behavior. This included instructions on how to request the test effectively (behavioural administration), information on how GPs use the test (behavioural feedback), information on the consequences for the patient of not undertaking the test (health consequences information), laboratory/counselor-based advice /education (credible source), modifying the test order form (restructuring the physical environment), providing guidelines (prompts/notices), and adding interpretive comments to the results (adding objects to the environment). These BCTs target four intervention functions: education, persuasion, environmental restructuring, and empowerment. CONCLUSIONS: This study effectively applied behavior change theory to identify viable strategies for improving the use of immunoglobulin testing in primary care using the TDF, the 'behaviour change wheel' and the BCT taxonomy. The identified BCTs form the basis for a theory-based intervention to improve the use of immunoglobulin testing in general practitioners. Future research will include the development and evaluation of this intervention.",0,0,
837,Primary care physicians' reasons for the failure of a randomized controlled trial (The TIGER Trial) on the implementation of epilepsy guidelines in primary care,"PURPOSE: To explore the reasons for the failure of a randomized controlled trial to influence the implementation of epilepsy guidelines in primary care and to develop a theory about likely associations in which guidelines would lead to changes in clinical behavior. METHODS: Qualitative study based on focus groups and a single in-depth interview. Participants included 47 primary health care workers selected from a targeted sample of 13 urban and rural primary care practices. RESULTS: The main reason for the lack of implementation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network epilepsy guideline was an established pattern of GP behavior that was supported by practice staff and had little perceived need for change. This was followed by a lack of knowledge of the existence and/or content of the guideline and perceived difficulties in putting it into practice due to scarcity of resources and potential patient resistance. The individual behavior of clinicians was therefore rooted in broader service structures and policies. CONCLUSIONS: Policies are more likely to be implemented when there are perceived problems with current service delivery. Attempts to facilitate the implementation of guidelines could also focus on areas where there is already a perceived need for guidelines or a disruption in one of the underlying variables that perpetuate the role and practice of health professionals. They may also be more likely when initiatives are broader than individual physician behavior and more broadly focused on redesigning the broader systems of care by engaging other providers to provide care coordination, improve patient self-management, and use information technology tools.",0,0,
838,The uptake of clinical practice guidelines by general practitioners: a qualitative study,"AIM: To explain the recent rapid reviewed changes in the uptake of locally implemented, evidence-based clinical guidelines for asthma and angina in primary care. METHODS: A primary care case study in two matched, neighboring districts in northern England, focusing on a stratified random sample of 49 general practitioners (GPs) from eight primary care groups. Data was collected from three cycles of mainly qualitative interviews conducted every six months before and after local policy dissemination and after audit data collection. Interviews examined attitudes, awareness and impact of the locally disseminated asthma and angina guidelines and the subsequent audit. Audit data on guideline use were also available from a parallel study. RESULTS: The rapid increase in guideline utilization observed in both the intervention and control groups was not explained by individual physicians or practice factors. Findings are attributed to primary care physicians' awareness of evidence-based medicine guidelines, new healthcare settings, and the clinical leadership activities of primary care groups. Changes in behavior reflect primary care physicians' decisions about what to record in case notes, as well as their clinical decisions, so the results may reflect a changing perception about accountability rather than preferred treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The production and dissemination of guidelines is best seen in the broader context of policy change. Guideline implementation studies should report before-and-after data and include significant qualitative components to identify important contextual factors.",0,0,
839,Antibiotic responsibility of the general surgeon: climbing the Rogers diffusion of the innovation curve - prospective cohort study,"INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this study was to establish compliance of general surgeon prescribing practices with local guidelines for intravenous and oral antibiotics. The secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of introducing antibiotic education. The Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Model was used to study the adoption of antibiotic stewardship practices. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data were collected from 100 patients before and 100 after the awareness intervention program. The educational intervention included raising awareness of a) the guidelines b) the pre-intervention outcomes c) the introduction of an IV oral antibiotic prompt sheet. Conformity with local guidelines was compared between pre- and post-intervention groups using Fisher's Exact Test or Pearson's Chi Test (SPSS Statistics V22). RESULTS: General surgeons' compliance with local IV oral antibiotics guidelines was poor and did not improve significantly after the awareness program. There was no inclusion of the antibiotics entry form. There was a trend towards an increase in the number of patients who switched from IV to oral antibiotics between 48 and 72 h and a significant increase (p<0.05) in the number of patients with a clearly documented intent to switch to IV antibiotics check. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic governance measures failed to inspire even a first group of innovators to use the antibiotic prompt sheets. It appears that educational interventions are effective in improving prescribing behavior and intention in a group of early adopters, but this does not reach critical mass. To improve antibiotic governance and begin the Rogers Diffusion of Innovation Curve, more needs to be done to involve general surgeons in timely and judicious antibiotic prescribing.",0,0,
840,Egg Donor Genetic Evaluation: Recipient Pair Preferences and Test Result,"AIM: To report preferences of recipient pairs for genetic testing of their egg donors. DESIGN: Observational report of the results of a genetic testing option form implemented as part of routine care. SETTING: Private practice. PATIENT(S): Recipients and egg donors. INTERVENTION(S): Prior to screening their egg donor, recipient couples completed a form detailing the required screening and recommended testing, which the couple could accept or decline. The couples were given information about the frequency of carriers, the risk to their child if the results were abnormal, and the costs. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT(S): Percentage of couples accepting optional tests. RESULT(S): Of the 63 couples with available data from their first test option form, 42 (67%) accepted a fragile X test and 21 (33%) rejected it, whereas 34 (54%) accepted and 29 (46%) Karyotyping rejected. When asked if they would accept additional testing from their donor if recommended by a genetic counselor, 15 (24%) said they would accept additional testing regardless of cost, 35 (56%) said they would not, and 13 (20%) indicated that their decision would depend on cost. In many cases, the genetic counselor took a history or obtained test results that influenced further testing, decisions to proceed, or provided information important to the child. CONCLUSION(S): Recipient pairs sometimes chose to decline testing that we recommended but did not require, despite the relatively low cost of these tests compared to the overall cost of the oocyte donation cycle.",0,0,
841,Genetic testing for children and adolescents. Who decides?,"In the future, there will likely be a wide range of DNA-based tests to diagnose single gene diseases and to identify predispositions to genetically influenced diseases. This article focuses on the ethical, legal, and psychological implications of screening healthy children and adolescents for such disorders. Testing may provide medical or psychological benefits but may affect parent-child bonds or the child's self-concept. Physicians may encounter situations where they must balance the wishes of the child or young person against the wishes of the parents. We examine the legal history and current status of minors as consumers of health care, psychosocial research on their decision-making maturity, impact of testing on family relationships, national commission views on appropriate ages of consent and full informed consent, ethical and legal requirements for literacy in children, and adolescents;"" and disclosure of genetic information. We propose guidelines for predictive genetic testing and counseling of children, and discuss the risks and benefits of testing.",0,0,
842,Genetic support for general practitioners - a demonstration project,"Primary care physicians need to be supported by specialized genetics services so that they can effectively manage the increasing relevance of genetics to their patients. Genetic counselors could be effective in such a role. This exploratory project aimed to improve the primary-tertiary interface by piloting such a GP service for a year. Tailored genetic education was carried out by a genetic counselor for 12 months in ten randomly selected GP practices in central England. A range of services were offered to practices, including facilitated genetic update sessions, a responsive counseling service and referral guidelines. The service was evaluated through pre- and post-intervention questionnaires and through seven semi-structured interviews. This article describes the development and delivery of this service and also reports on the experiences of a sample of the participants. Participants reported positive attitudes towards the service, saying that they gained knowledge and confidence, and recognized limitations and gaps in their current knowledge. The consistent connection with a genetic specialist service through a genetic counselor had a positive effect during the project and the participants have continued to use the genetic counselor for advice and support with genetic patient problems since the end of the project. This is the first example of this service delivery model. Further research using a larger sample and other behavior change measures needs to be conducted to assess whether this model should be adopted more widely.",0,0,
843,German translation of Suicidal Patient Observation Chart (SPOC) - a tool for practice,"Caring for inpatients with suicide is a complex and responsible task. Direct and immediate intensive care and therapeutic support, also referred to as special observation, is still recommended in guidelines (DGPPN, 2012) and is perhaps one of the most commonly used interventions in the in-hospital care of suicidal patients. It involves many ways of developing the relationship between the observer and the patient. The original SPOC was developed in Sweden with the aim of increasing the quality of systematic documentation in the care of suicidal patients. It is an instrument for the systematic documentation of observational behavior or abnormal moods during an acute suicide crisis, for example feelings such as ""worried, anxious"" or other possible influencing factors such as ""sudden mood swings"". In this way, the SPOC can ensure the process of systematic documentation of special observations and increase its quality, ie who documented what at what time. In addition, SPOC can allow better communication of the observation process to the multidisciplinary team and also to the patient. The SPOC includes the 28 items and covers 24 separate observation periods. The aim of this work is to present the translation process from the English to the German SPOC version. The translation process followed a five-step model. In the first step, the English version was translated by two German native speakers. In the second step, the first two translation results were discussed by the group of experts (authors) and a new version was developed. In the third step, the first German version (two English native speakers) was translated back into English. In the fourth step, the results were viewed by the expert groups (authors) and the so-called ""preliminary version"" was created. The last step involves proof of content validity by 52 nurses. The evidence uncovered some misunderstandings and helped improve the tool in its final version. With the translation, the German-speaking nursing practice in psychiatry has a tool that can be used by psychiatric nursing staff for their complex interventions in this special patient group.",0,0,
844,Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy as vascular risk signals: a review and classification of the evidence,"The emergence of common pregnancy-related medical disorders identifies women at high risk of developing future vascular disease. Systematic reviews of cohort studies show that gestational diabetes carries a 7-fold risk of type 2 diabetes and pre-eclampsia carries a 1.8-fold risk for type 2 diabetes and 3.4-fold risk for hypertension. Gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) increase the risk of premature vascular disease, but the 2-fold risk increase associated with preeclampsia can only be partially explained by the development of traditional vascular risk factors. Despite the compelling evidence supporting gestational diabetes and HDP as indicators of vascular risk, there are no published Canadian vascular prevention guidelines that recognize these women after childbirth. In contrast, the American Heart Association's 2011 guidelines on cardiovascular disease in women include gestational diabetes and HDP in their vascular risk assessment. Studies show that the importance of monitoring vascular risk factors in these women after pregnancy is underestimated by the women themselves and their doctors. Although the American Diabetes Prevention Program study showed that a mindful diet and physically active lifestyle reduce the risk of diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes, acceptance of these health behaviors is low. Qualitative studies confirm the need for tailored strategies that address barriers and provide social support. Further research is also needed on approaches to reduce vascular risk in women with gestational diabetes and a history of HDP. Failure to do so will miss an early window for chronic disease prevention in high-risk young women.",0,0,

846,Global Initiatives to Improve Cancer Care in Resource-Constrained Areas: What ASCO Members Are Doing and How You Can Get Involved,"Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2008, 7.6 million deaths were due to cancer, accounting for 13% of all deaths. It is estimated that around 30% of cancer deaths can be attributed to the top five behavioral and dietary risks. These include a high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable consumption, lack of exercise, and tobacco and alcohol consumption. A number of viral infections such as hepatitis B and C and HPV are responsible for about 20% of cancer deaths. About 70% of cancer deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Due to the increasing number of older people and improved control of comorbidities, the number of cancer deaths worldwide is projected to continue increasing, with an estimated 13.1 million deaths in 2030. To meet this need, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO ) is developing a truly international organization. Over a third of ASCO members practice in over 100 countries and represent the world's largest collection of expertise and insight into the treatment of cancer. More than half of the attendees at the ASCO annual meeting are from outside the United States. The Journal of Clinical Oncology is read by more than 24,000 subscribers worldwide and is available in various languages. To fulfill its mission, ASCO has a number of international programs to share knowledge and provide tools to help physicians around the world treat their patients. These programs include mentoring and knowledge sharing, educational initiatives, and scientific and educational meetings. This provides ample opportunity for a commitment to improving cancer care worldwide.",0,0,
847,Global Minimum Requirements: A Pathway to Competency-Based Medical Education,"With the increasing globalization of medicine and the emerging concept of a ""global medical profession"", the question of the essential competencies that all doctors must have comes into focus. If defined, these competencies would help indicate what teachers should teach, what students should learn, and what educational experiences all physicians must have. The “minimum essential competencies” that all graduates must have if they want to become a doctor were identified by the Institute for International Medical Education (IIME), sponsored by the China Medical Board of New York, through working groups of education and health policy experts and representatives of the most important international medical training organizations. In the first phase of the project, seven domains were identified that define the knowledge, skills, professional behavior and ethics required of all physicians, regardless of where they received their general practice training. Appropriate instruments for evaluating the individual areas were identified. In the second phase of the project, the ""Global Minimum Essential Requirements"" (GMER) will be implemented experimentally at several Chinese medical schools. The goal of the third phase will be to share the results of this educational experiment aimed at improving the quality of medical education with the global educational community.",0,0,

852,"Cognitive-behavioural therapy in the first episode psychosis group: who is referred, who attends, and who administers it?","AIM: Most national guidelines recommend psychological therapy for people with first-episode psychosis (FEP), but interventions that have been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in research settings do not always translate effectively to real clinical settings. In a limited healthcare system, it is important to understand the system and patient barriers to participating in effective treatment. We sought to determine which patient characteristics influenced clinicians' decision to refer or not to refer cognitive behavioral therapy for FEP and which characteristics were associated with referred patients participating/non-participating and adhering/non-participating in the program. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2008, all cases of confirmed FEP from a defined geographic region were analyzed using the Structured Clinical Interview diagnoses for DSM-IV-TR-Axis I disorders for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM- IV) Examined the Positive Symptom Rating Scale, Negative Symptom Rating Scale, Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, and Birchwood Insight Scale. The duration of the untreated psychosis was determined using the Beiser scale. RESULTS: Of the 124 (77 males, 47 females) individuals in the final sample, 88 (72%) were referred for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), 52 (59%) participated, and 12 (23%) did not complete CBT . Those with a higher level of insight into the need for treatment (U = 740.00, z = -2.63, P = 0.008) and a higher level of positive symptoms (t(120) = -3.064, P = 0.003) were more likely to be referred to CBT. Those with higher educational attainment (chi(2) = 9.48, P = 0.03) and fewer negative symptoms, particularly related to global attention (t(85) = 2.32, P = 0.03), participated rather attended and completed CBT. CONCLUSION: Within an early intervention service for FEP, it appears that individuals with less education, more negative symptoms, and less insight faced significant barriers to successfully completing group CBT. More information for referring clinicians about the benefits of CBT in FEP could help increase referral rates. Reaching out to people at risk of disengagement or non-compliance should also be considered.",0,0,
853,Group therapy for adolescents with repeated self-harm: randomized controlled trial with economic assessment,"AIM To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group therapy for self-harm in young people. DESIGN Two-arm, individually (assessor)-blinded, parallel, randomized, allocation study of a group therapy intervention in addition to routine care versus routine care alone. Randomization was by minimization, controlling for baseline incidence of self-harm, presence of behavioral disorders, depressive disorders, and severity of psychosocial stress. PARTICIPANTS Adolescents aged 12 to 17 with at least two prior episodes of self-harm within the past 12 months. Exclusion criteria were: no English speaking, low weight anorexia nervosa, acute psychosis, significant learning disabilities (defined by need for a special school), current placement in secure care. Establishment Eight psychiatric services for children and adolescents in North West Britain. INTERVENTIONS Manual, developmental group therapy program designed specifically for youth who are self-harming, with an acute phase over six weekly sessions, followed by a refresher phase with weekly groups for as long as needed. Details of routine care were collected from the participating centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the frequency of subsequent recurrent episodes of self-harm. Secondary outcomes were the severity of subsequent self-harm, mood disorders, suicidal ideation, and global functioning. Total costs of health, social care, education, and criminal justice services, as well as family-related costs and lost productivity were recorded. RESULTS 183 adolescents were assigned to each arm (total n=366). Loss to follow-up was low (<4%). For all endpoints, the overall study cohort showed significant improvement from baseline to follow-up. For the primary endpoint of self-harm incidence, the proportional odds ratio of group therapy versus routine care, adjusted for relevant baseline variables, was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.44, P=0.95) after 6 months and 0.88 (0.59 to 1.33, P=0.52) at 1 year. For the severity of subsequent self-harm, the equivalent odds ratios were 0.81 (0.54 to 1.20, P=0.29) at 6 months and 0.94 (0.63 to 1.40, P=0.75 ) after 1 year. The total cost for one year was higher in the group therapy arm (£21,781) than in routine care (£15,372), but the difference was not significant (95% CI -1416 to 10782, P=0.132). CONCLUSIONS The addition of this targeted group therapy program did not improve self-harm outcomes for adolescents who self-harm repeatedly, nor was there evidence of cost-effectiveness. Results to endpoint for the cohort as a whole were better than current clinical expectations. Test registration ISRCTN 20496110.",0,0,
854,Growth and nutritional risk in developmentally delayed children,"INTRODUCTION: Nutritional risk affects outcome in developmental delay. The main goals were to identify the frequency and the factors that contribute to growth retardation. METHODS: The review of clinical data was completed for 500 developmentally delayed patients admitted to an early intervention service. Data were collected using the standardized parental nutritional screening checklist before and at the time of the initial nutritional assessment. The data was compared to nutritional assessment data, GOSH and FSAI dietary guidelines. Weight category was determined using RCPCH growth and BMI charts. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 20 (IBM Statistics 20.0). RESULTS: A nutritional risk was identified in 48.6%. The weight categories were stunted (13.5%), underweight (7.7%), overweight (8.4%), and obese (4.3%) at the initial assessment. Stunting was correlated with age < 1 year (p=0.000) and with gestational age (p=0.017), with the highest rates identified in those aged 32 to 36 weeks (3.6%). Weight class was associated with introduction of solids 17 weeks prior (10.1%), ANOVA showed significance (P = 0.013). In 22.7% of the people examined, the nutritional risk was poorly recognized by the parents. Feeding difficulties were common: 4.2% were receiving enteral feeding, 7.7% were receiving prescribed nutritional supplements, 29.1% (n=121) had feeding difficulties, and 13.9% (n=58) had behavioral feeding difficulties. The iron intake did not correspond to the recommended intake in 20.9% (n = 87), the calcium intake in 4.5% (n = 19). The prevalence of constipation was 21.6, of which 11.8% required medical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Developmental delay predisposes to nutritional deficiencies, which affect outcome. Screening, assessment, and timely interventions are warranted to prevent poorer developmental outcomes.",0,0,
855,Conformity with guidelines in the treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the single leading cause of death with increasing morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to optimize pharmacotherapy for patients with COPD have been updated based on promising results from randomized clinical trials. We examined the frequency and factors of guideline adherence by physicians in clinical practice at a university hospital. METHODS: Patients with a spirometry-confirmed clinical diagnosis of COPD presenting to the outpatient clinics were included. The primary outcome was provider compliance with the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. Subjects who received a rescue inhaler (all patients) or at least one long-acting bronchodilator (stage II) or at least one long-acting bronchodilator plus an inhaled corticosteroid (stage III-IV) were classified as conforming to the guidelines. Demographics, clinical information, and provider type were recorded. Provider type was classified by both as primary care physician (PCP), pulmonologist, or co-management. RESULTS: Of 450 subjects who met study criteria, 246 (54.7%) received guideline-compliant treatment. Age, gender, race, disease severity, and comorbidities were not associated with guideline adherence. Multivariate analysis showed that patients treated by a general practitioner and a pulmonologist together were more likely to receive guideline-compliant treatment than those treated by one or the other (odds ratio: 4.59; 95 % confidence interval: 2.92, 7.22, p<0.001). Conclusions: Slightly more than half of the stable COPD patients are treated in accordance with the guidelines. Joint treatment by a general practitioner and a pneumologist increases the likelihood of receiving guideline-compliant inhalation therapy.",0,0,
856,Guideline implementation in allied health professions: a systematic literature review,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines aim to improve the safety and quality of patient care by providing physicians with graded recommendations based on best practice. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the introduction of clinical guidelines for healthcare professionals and assess the effectiveness of the strategies used to disseminate and implement the guidelines. METHODS: A comprehensive search of six electronic databases up to June 2006 and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care database was performed. Randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time-series studies were included when the intervention aimed to implement guidelines in the allied health professions. The articles were checked for suitability and their methodological quality was assessed"";"" Data were independently extracted by two reviewers. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality varied widely, with the proportion of quality criteria met ranging from 0 to 6 out of 7. In most studies, the reported effects on patient and process outcomes were small and in favor of the intervention group. Of the 14 included studies, 10 focused on educational interventions. Six of the 14 studies used a single intervention strategy and seven used a multifaceted implementation strategy. One study compared both single and multi-faceted strategies. Multifaceted interventions were no more effective than single intervention strategies, and the effects of the same strategy varied between studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support a defined strategy for implementing guidelines for healthcare professionals. When implementing clinical guidelines, it is important to first identify specific barriers to change using theoretical frameworks for behavior change and then to develop strategies that deal with these barriers. When measuring the effectiveness of these strategies, professionals should consider the use of patient and process outcomes and select outcomes that reflect their goals.",0,1,
857,Guideline implementation: What the literature doesn't tell us,"BACKGROUND: Despite numerous studies and literature reviews on guideline implementation, it remains unclear whether and how clinical guidelines can be used to improve the quality of care. This study sought to find out whether these studies and reviews recognized the importance of systems thinking and organizational change for implementation. METHODS: A literature search was performed for systematic reviews of guideline implementation or studies to improve practice. Each review was examined for the extent to which it identified or discussed the value of system changes, organizational support, practice environment factors, and use of a change process. RESULTS: Forty-seven high-quality systematic reviews were found. They broadly agreed that using reminders and possibly using feedback during the course of clinical encounters are the most effective methods of policy implementation. However, those same reviews rarely identified these strategies as system changes, and there was little discussion of the need for organizational support or attention to various environmental variables that might affect implementation. The change process to introduce a new or modified practice system received even less attention. CONCLUSION: Reviews of guideline implementation studies have focused on how to change the behavior of individual physicians. Little attention has been paid to the impact of practice systems or organizational support of clinical behavior, the process by which change is brought about, or the role of the practice environment context in which change is sought. Recent attention to these issues can help us better understand and implement the process of improving medical care.",0,1,

METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. Outcome assessment was by a self-report questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Dartmouth COOP Health Status), an interview at 1 month, and a self-report at 3 and 12 months. The primary outcome was improvement in Dartmouth COOP total score from baseline to 3 months. RESULTS: Four patients required treatment to achieve improvement in one additional patient at 3 months (number required to treat [NNT] 4, 95% confidence interval [CIs] 3 to 12). The intervention group was more confident about returning to activity one month after hospital discharge. Treated patients had fewer further treatment needs.

860,Community pharmacists' guidelines and educational visits to improve general practice prescribing: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of guidelines with and without face-to-face educational visits by community pharmacists in improving the general prescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: Cluster randomized study of 20 general practices in Avon, England. The practices were randomized into three groups: “control”; mailed guidelines;” mailed guidelines plus educational visits. General practitioners (GPs) in the latter group received two individual visits from pharmacists in the community. Prescribing changes were measured using results derived from Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data. The primary endpoint was the change in prescription volume of ibuprofen, diclofenac and naproxen as a percentage of total NSAID prescription. Six secondary endpoints included other measures of prescribing quality and quantity. A cost-benefit analysis was carried out. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for the primary endpoint: practices that received outreach visits prescribed only 2.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8 to 5.0] more of the three recommended NSAIDs than the control practices and 1.6% (95% CI: -1.4 to 4.7) more than practices receiving guidelines only. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, only one secondary endpoint showed a statistically significant difference between the groups: the proportion of prescriptions for the five most commonly used drugs was 2.2% (95% CI: 0.9 to 3. 6) higher in the outreach group than the control group. Both interventions showed a net increase in costs. CONCLUSIONS: Although good baseline prescribing at participating practices limited opportunities for improvement, this study provides no evidence that guidelines with or without educational visits by community pharmacists lead to significant improvements in prescribing behavior.",0,0,
861,Guidelines and the psychology of medical decision-making in the treatment of depressive disorders,"Guidelines aim to improve medical decision-making. In contrast to textbooks and journals, which aim to improve medical knowledge, guidelines attempt to influence medical behavior. Scientific models of medical decision-making such as action theory and empirical data on the effectiveness of guidelines suggest that guidelines do not always achieve their goal and can even worsen medical quality. The guideline problem in medicine is discussed in connection with depressive illnesses. The problem still applies to medicine as a whole. Therefore, it must be tested in controlled clinical trials whether physicians who are exposed to the guidelines achieve better results in their patients than physicians who are naïve to the guidelines. Only such guidelines should be designated as evidence-based for which positive effects have been empirically proven.",0,0,
862,Guidelines as rationing instruments: A qualitative analysis of psychosocial patient selection criteria for cardiac interventions,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for cardiac interventions often include psychosocial criteria for patient selection, which may introduce social value judgments into clinical and care rationing decisions. The aim of this study was to examine the terms, justifications and meanings of psychosocial patient characteristics in cardiological guidelines. METHODS: We selected English language guidelines published since 1990 and chapters in textbooks published since 1989. These guidelines have brought together multiple sources of evidence and expertise and made recommendations for patient selection for specific procedures. A multidisciplinary team of medical and social scientists extracted passages on psychosocial criteria and developed categories and conceptual contexts to describe and interpret their content. RESULTS: Sixty-five papers met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Forty-five (69%) cited psychosocial criteria as procedure indications or contraindications. The latter fell into several categories, including behavioral and psychological problems, relationships with significant others, financial resources, social roles, and environmental circumstances. INTERPRETATION: Psychosocial characteristics play two roles in patient selection: as risk factors inherent in the candidate or as indicators of the need for a specific intervention. Guidelines typically simply list psychosocial contraindications without clarifying their specific nature or justifying their use. Psychosocial considerations can be helpful in evaluating patients for cardiac procedures, but become ethically controversial when used to limit access. The use of psychosocial indications and contraindications could be improved by more detailed descriptions of the psychosocial problem in question, explanations of why the criterion is important, and justification of the characteristic with a biological rationale or research evidence.",0,0,
863,Guidelines for youth prevention services: the GAPS in practice,"DESIGN: Pre- and Post-Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) comparison of results collected through chart audit. SETTING: A general pediatric clinic in a rural hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents who underwent annual screening between April 1, 1998 and March 31, 2001. A random sample of 441 medical records was reviewed. INTERVENTION: Training on the GAPS model and use of the questionnaire began in April 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification, discussion and referral of GAPS-related risk behaviors. RESULTS: The medical records of 162 younger adolescents (aged 11-15 years) and 279 older adolescents (aged 16-19 years) were reviewed. Detection of risk behavior increased from 19% at baseline to 95% with the initial GAPS and 87% with the regular GAPS. The most common risk factor was having a rifle or firearm in the household (younger adolescents 47% and older adolescents 39%). The mean number of documented risky behaviors and health concerns was higher in the initial GAPS (4.8 and 1.3, respectively) than in the periodic GAPS (3.8 and 0.7) (P = 0.01 and 0.006). The GAPS questionnaires revealed lower levels of risky behavior compared to a local youth risky behavior survey. Controlling for gender, age, and clinician, discussion of psychosocial issues increased during the study period"";"" However, there were significant differences between clinicians in terms of the subjects treated. The GAPS-related recommendation rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The GAPS model improves the recognition and discussion of risky behaviors by clinicians.",0,0,
864,Guidelines for assessing postnatal problems: introducing evidence-based guidelines to Australian general practice,"BACKGROUND: Postnatal morbidity is high and many primary care physicians lack the confidence and knowledge to deal with common postnatal problems. There is a high rate of consultation, but few women report general health problems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to increase the knowledge and skills of primary care physicians to enable them to recognize and manage common health problems of women in the year after childbirth. METHODS: An educational program [Guidelines for Assessing Postnatal Problems (GAPP)] embedded in a large randomized community intervention study [Program of Resources, Information and Support for Mothers (PRISM)] with a before/after assessment was conducted by Australian GPs who in four metropolitan and four rural communities. The program included audits, interactive workshops, role plays, and evidence-based guidelines, and was evaluated at baseline and at 6 months through written questionnaires and a surgical consultation with a trained rater on simulated patients. RESULTS: A total of 68 (86%) general practitioners participated in the full GAPP program. The likelihood that a primary care physician improved on knowledge items ranged from 1.0 to 16, with the largest change occurring in knowledge of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for maternal depression. Of the GPs with an incorrect answer at baseline, the percentage who showed improved knowledge at follow-up ranged from 22 to 100%. About half of the primary care physicians demonstrated excellent communication skills at baseline. Of the remaining GPs, more than half demonstrated greatly improved skills to identify common postnatal follow-up problems. At the simulated baseline patient visit, 70% of primary care physicians inquired about sexual problems but none about the possibility of abuse, while at follow-up 94% asked about sexual problems and 51.5% facilitated disclosure of physical and emotional abuse. Anonymous feedback on the program from participating GPs showed that 89% felt the program had positively impacted their actual practice. Interestingly, general practitioners demonstrated greater knowledge and skills in the simulated setting than on the written questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: This relatively short, multifaceted educational program helped many participants improve their knowledge and skills needed to improve both physical and emotional health after childbirth. Despite being experienced clinicians and actively participating in an interviewing program, half of the primary care physicians did not facilitate disclosure of the underlying sensitive issue (abuse) during follow-up and could benefit from further in-depth training in effective communication skills.",0,0,
865,"Guidelines for family-centered care in the neonatal, pediatric, and adult intensive care unit","OBJECTIVE: To provide clinicians with evidence-based strategies to optimize family support of critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: We used the Council of Medical Specialty Societies Principles for Clinical Guideline Development as a framework for guideline development. We assembled an international multidisciplinary team of 29 members with expertise in guideline development, evidence analysis and family-centred care to revise the 2007 clinical practice guidelines for family support in the patient-centred ICU. We conducted a scoping review of qualitative research examining family-centered care in the ICU. Thematic analyzes were conducted to support the development of population, intervention, comparison and outcome questions. Patients and families acknowledged the importance of interventions and outcomes. We then conducted a systematic review using the Recommendation Classification, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to make recommendations for practice. The recommendations were subject to electronic voting with predetermined voting thresholds. No industry funding was associated with the development of the guideline. RESULTS: The scoping review identified 683 qualitative studies; 228 were used for thematic analysis and development of population, intervention, comparison, and outcome questions. 238 studies met the inclusion criteria. We made 23 recommendations at moderate, low, and very low evidence levels on: communication with family members, family presence, family support, consultations and ICU team members, and operational and environmental issues. We provide recommendations for future research and working tools to support the implementation of the recommendations into practice. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines identify the evidence base for best practices for family-centered care in the ICU. All recommendations were weak, underscoring the relative emergence of this area of research and the importance of future research to identify the most effective interventions to improve this important aspect of critical care.",0,0,
866,Guidelines for improving treatment entry and retention and antiretroviral adherence for people living with HIV: evidence-based recommendations from a panel of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care,"DESCRIPTION: After HIV diagnosis, timely entry into and maintenance of HIV medical care is critical to the delivery of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence to ART is one of the key factors for a successful HIV treatment outcome and is essential to minimize the emergence of drug resistance. The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care convened a panel to develop evidence-based recommendations to optimize entry into, retention of, and adherence to ART for people living with HIV. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to generate an evidence base limited to randomized controlled trials and observational versus comparative trials that had at least 1 measured biological or behavioral endpoint. A total of 325 studies met the criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted and coded data from each study using a standardized data extraction form. Panel members drafted recommendations based on the evidence for each method or intervention, and then rated the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of each recommendation.

867,Guidelines for the interaction of the therapeutic team in the inpatient treatment of patients with chronic neurotic diseases,"When treating inpatients with chronic neurotic disorders, we tried both to reduce the burdens on the therapeutic team (doctors, nurses, other therapists) that are usually caused by these patients, and to improve the treatment outcome. Therefore, three to five guidelines for dealing with the patient were given to the therapeutic team and illustrated by possible verbatim statements to the patient. The guidelines aimed at a general interaction-oriented approach to the patient and did not specify any specific therapeutic interventions. They were constructed according to the principles of brief therapy as developed at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto. The results of our intervention in the treatment of ten patients are reported. Overall, the therapeutic team assessed the guidelines as positive. The success of the therapy varied greatly. A comparison with a matched-pair control group showed a favorable trend. Initial evaluations by the prescribing team predicted eventual improvement in patients.",0,0,

869,Apallic Syndrome/Vegetative State Quality Management Guidelines,"INTRODUCTION: Epidemiology in Europe shows steadily increasing numbers of apallic syndrome (AS)/vegetative state (VS) as a consequence of advanced rescue, emergency services, intensive care after acute brain injury and high-level activating home nursing for fully dependent end-cases in the secondary stage of progressive neurological disease. The treatment of patients with irreversible permanent AS/VS has been the subject of ongoing scientific and moral-legal debates over the past decade. METHODS: Under the auspices of the Scientific Panel on Neurotraumatology of the European Federation of Neurological Societies, a Task Force on AS/VS Quality Management Guidelines was established to address key issues related to AS/VS prevalence and quality management. The collection and analysis of scientific data on Class II (III) evidence from the literature and recommendations based on best practice, emerging from the expertise of the task force members, are in line with the EFNS guidelines. RESULTS: The overall incidence of new full-stage AS/VS cases of any etiology is 0.5-2/100,000 population per year. About one-third are traumatic and two-thirds non-traumatic cases. Increasing numbers of hypoxic brain damage and progressive neurological disease have been noted. The central conceptual criticism rests on the assessment and diagnosis of all the different AS/VS stages solely on the basis of behavioral findings without knowledge of the exact or uniform pathogenesis or neuropathological findings and the uncertainty of the clinical assessment due to different inclusion criteria. No specific diagnostics, no specific medical management can be recommended for the treatment and rehabilitation of AS class II or III. For this reason, the diagnosis of the clinical features and the appropriate treatment of AS/VS patients in the ""AS full, remission, defect and end stages"" require an indispensable prerequisite for the professional training and expertise of physicians and rehabilitation staff. INTERPRETATION: The management of AS aims at the social reintegration of the patients or must ensure humanistic active care in case of therapy failure. The outcome depends on the cause and duration of AS/VS and the age of the patient. There is no single AS/VS specific laboratory test, regimen, or stimulatory intervention that can be recommended to improve higher cerebral function. Quality management requires at least 3 years of advanced training and ongoing training to obtain recognition of qualification for AS/VS treatment and expertise. Sine qua non areas, which include AS/VS facilities for early and long-term rehabilitation, are required on a population basis (prevalence of 2/100,000/year) to expedite functional recovery and prevent or treat complications. Nursing homes are needed for respectful human care, including basal sensorimotor stimulation techniques. Passive euthanasia is viewed by physicians as an act of mercy in relation to withholding treatment"";"" However, ethical and legal issues related to food and hydration deprivation and end-of-life discussions are of great concern. The purpose of the guideline is to inform neurologists, neurosurgeons, other physicians working with AS/VS patients, neurorehabilitation staff, patients, family members, and health authorities.",0,0,
870,Guidelines for reporting health interventions using mobile phones: Mobile Health (mHealth) Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist,"To improve the completeness of reporting on mobile health interventions (mHealth), the WHO mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group developed the mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist. The development process for mERA consisted of convening an expert panel to recommend an appropriate approach, convening a global expert review panel to develop the checklist, and piloting the checklist. The guiding principle for the development of these criteria was to identify a minimum set of information needed to define what the mHealth intervention is (content), where it is implemented (context) and how it was implemented (technical characteristics ) to help them repeat the procedure. This paper presents the resulting 16-point checklist and a detailed explanation and elaboration for each point, with illustrative report examples. We expect that the use of these guidelines, through widespread adoption, will standardize the quality of mHealth evidence reporting and indirectly improve the quality of mHealth evidence. #### Summary points Mobile technologies have the potential to fill the systemic gaps needed to improve access to and use of health services, particularly among underserved populations. mHealth, defined as the use of mobile and wireless technologies for health, aims to leverage the rapid adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve health system efficiency and health outcomes.

872,Guidelines in medical-related professions,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate practice variation and promote the delivery of evidence-based healthcare. OBJECTIVES: To identify and assess the impact of studies introducing clinical practice guidelines in nursing (including health visits), midwives and other medicine-related professionals. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group Index, MEDLINE (1975 to 1996), EMBASE, Cinahl and Sigle to 1996, the NHS Economic Evaluations Database (1994 to 1996), DHSS-Data (1983 to 1996). ), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (1994 to 1996), and reference lists of articles. We also hand-searched the Quality in Health Care journal, made personal connections with content experts, and contacted libraries selected by a panel of experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials, controlled before-and-after trials, and interrupted time-series analyzes of intervention implementation compared 1. Clinical guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus no guidelines”; 2. Guidelines plus dissemination and/or implementation strategies versus guidelines plus alternative dissemination and/or implementation strategies and 3. (post hoc) guidelines used by healthcare professionals versus standard healthcare The participants were nurses, midwives and other healthcare professionals DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included, involving more than 467 healthcare professionals. Reporting on study methods was inadequate for all studies. In all but one study, nurses were the targeted occupation."" One study was aimed exclusively at dieticians. The different behaviors that were targeted included the management of hypertension, low back pain and hyperlipidemia. Nine studies were identified for comparison 1. Three out of five Studies observed improvements in at least some nursing processes and six out of eight studies observed improvements in patient outcomes Only one study included a formal economic assessment with equivocal results For comparison 2, three studies were identified but poor methodologies made it difficult to draw firm conclusions Six studies were identified (post hoc) for comparison 3. These studies generally supported the hypothesis that there was no difference between nurse care following clinical guidelines and standard practice. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that guideline-based nursing is effective in transforming the process and outcome of nursing by medical-related professionals. However, caution should be exercised when generalizing the results to other professions and settings.",0,1,
873,Guidelines for managing smoking during the perioperative period,"Smoking is a public health issue of particular concern during the perioperative period, as it puts patients scheduled for surgery at risk of a 20% increase in in-hospital mortality and a 40% increase in the risk of major postoperative complications. In addition, current smoking increases almost all specific surgical complications. The perioperative period offers a real opportunity for smoking cessation. The rate of preoperative smoking cessation can be significantly increased by behavioral management and the prescription of a nicotine substitute before a planned surgical intervention. Preoperative smoking cessation should be routinely recommended regardless of the time of intervention, although benefit increases proportionally with the duration of smoking cessation. All professionals in the care pathway (GPs, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, ICUs, nurses) need to educate smokers about the positive effects of smoking cessation and provide them with dedicated management and personalized follow-up. For children, cessation of parental smoking or removal of the child from environmental tobacco smoke for as long as possible prior to surgery is essential.",0,0,
874,"Guidelines, editors, pharma and the biological paradigm shift","Private investment in biomedical research has increased in recent decades. In most places it has been hailed as the next best thing after technology itself. Much of the intellectual talent from academic institutions is absorbed into lucrative positions in industry. Applied research finds willing collaborators in the venture-backed industry, ensuring symbiotic growth for both. There are also significant costs involved. As academia interacts with industry, major conflicts of interest have arisen that are particularly true in biomedical research. They relate to disputes over patents and royalties, hostile encounters between academia and industry and between public and private companies, legal entanglements, scientific misconduct of various kinds, antagonistic press and patient advocacy lobbies, and a general atmosphere in which commercial interest takes precedence over patient welfare. The pharma image stinks because of a series of omissions and order errors. A recent example is the suppression of negative sentiment about Bayer's Trasylol (aprotinin) and Eli Lilly's Xigris (rhAPC) marketing maneuvers. Whenever there is a conflict between patient vulnerability and profit motives, the pharmaceutical industry often leans toward the latter. In addition, there are documents that bring to light how companies often cross the line between patient welfare and profit-oriented behavior. A voluntary moratorium on pharmaceutical spending to spoil drug prescribers is needed. A code of practice recently adopted by OPPI in India to limit drug company spending on junkets and jewelry is a welcome move. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) are considered important as they guide the diagnostic/therapeutic regimen of a large number of physicians and hospitals and provide recommendations on drugs, their dosages and selection criteria. In addition to clinical trials, they are another area of growing influence for the pharmaceutical industry. For example, a relatively recent 2002 survey found that approximately 60% of 192 authors of clinical practice guidelines reported having financial ties to the companies whose medicines were being considered. There are strong arguments for creating CPGs based not only on effectiveness but also on cost-efficiency. The various effects of this must be explained. The work of bodies like the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Collaboration and Guidelines Advisory Committee (GAC) is also worth looking at. Even the actions of foundations dedicated to improving disease have come under scrutiny. The process of creating best practice guidelines for interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and physicians has already begun and can have important implications for patient care. Similarly, Good Publication Practices (GPP) for pharmaceutical companies have also been established, aiming to improve the behavior of pharmaceutical companies in reporting drug trials. The rapidly increasing trend towards industry influence and control has become a problem for many. It is of such importance that the Association of American Medical Colleges has issued two relatively recent documents - one in 2001 on ""Managing Individual Conflicts of Interest"" and the other in 2002 on ""Managing Institutional Conflicts of Interest in Conducting Clinical Research."" Academic Medical Centers (AMCs), like medical education and research organizations elsewhere, must take means to minimize their institutional conflicts of interest in conducting clinical research, and documents are now available addressing these issues The ICMJE- The 2001 revision requires full disclosure of the sponsor's role in the research, as well as assurances that investigators are independent of the sponsor, responsible for study design and conduct, have independent access to all study data, and control all editorial and publishing ion decisions. However, the results of a 2002 study suggest that academic institutions routinely participate in clinical research that does not adhere to ICMJE standards for accountability, access to data and control of publication, industry profitability and outflow of research grants to the Science. Industry supports new, non-traditional therapies, regardless of what is effective. Whatever traditional therapy is supported is most likely because the company in question has a product with a large stake there that has remained a ""gold standard"" or that this player believes has some ""juice"" left. Industry sponsorship mainly concerns potential drugs. not to determine whether there may be non-pharmacological interventions that are just as good, if not better. In the paradigm shift towards biological psychiatry, the role of industry sponsorship is not obvious, but is probably more far-reaching than many have realized or right thinking might warrant for the long-term health of the industry. A topic of great importance is protection of interests of research subjects. Patients agree to become objects of research, not only for personal medical benefit, but also for the benefit of the rest of the patient population and to further medical research. We all accept that industry needs to make a profit and invest in research and development. The pharmaceutical industry is huge. However, we must also accept that there is a fundamental difference between marketing strategies for other companies and those for pharmaceuticals. The ultimate barometer is patient well-being, and no drug that affects it can stand the test of time. So how does it make long-term economic sense to market inferior products? The biggest mistake veteran players in the industry can make is trying to adopt the shady techniques of the up-and-coming newcomer. Keeping secret marketing/sales tactics, manufacturing process, other business expansion strategies and plans, anti-competitive strategies are good business tactics. But it's critical that secrecy as a tactic does not extend to reporting research findings, particularly those that contradict one's product. Pharmacy has no choice but to make a quality product, develop comprehensive side effect profiles, and only commercialize it if it passes both tests. Why do pharma resort to questionable tactics? There are two main reasons for this: Despite all the constraints, a drug comes to the pharmacy after enormous investments. There are crippling overheads and infrastructure costs that need to be recouped. And massive profit margins must be maintained. Relying solely on real drug discoveries would be too much of a risk. Industrial companies have to find the right balance between profit and credibility. When it comes to making a profit, the marketing champions play their part. Credibility assessments have researchers and paid spokespersons playing their part. Everything is fine until marketing is based on credibility. When there is nothing for credibility, something is projected as a whole and marketing is done in the calculated hope that profits can accrue, since making profits must go on endlessly. This is what drives the pharmaceutical industry to use even questionable means to make a profit. There are essentially four types of medicines. First, drugs that work and have minimal side effects; second, drugs that work but have serious side effects; third, drugs that don't work and have minimal side effects; and fourth, drugs that work minimally but have serious side effects. It is the second and fourth types that cause major problems for the industry. Often the industry tries to project the fourth type as the second to escape censorship. The great cat-and-mouse game played by conscientious researchers is to expose the third and fourth types as what they are, and not allowing the industry to portray them as the first and second types respectively. The main game is to prevent the second type from being projected as the first. The third kind is essentially harmless, so they draw criticism and some hilarity at the antics to market them. But they escape anything more than a rap on the knuckles, except when projected as the first type. What captains of industry and veteran players need is to realize: Their prime mover can only bring out the first type. They only accept the second type until they can lay their hands on the first. 3. The third type can occasionally be toyed with to secure gains, but never by projecting them as the first type. 4. The fourth type are the laggards, a real threat to credibility and therefore do not deserve market hype or publicity. Finding out why most pharmaceutical companies indulge in questionable tactics leads us to some interesting solutions to prevent such tactics with the least amount of trouble for everyone involved, even while keeping both profits and credibility intact.",0,0,
875,Guideline-based indicators for measuring the quality of prenatal care,"Rationale, Aims and Goals: No comprehensive measurement of the quality of prenatal care is available. Late posting or low number of checks are often used as substitutes for poor quality, leaving uncertainty about the actual content of the care received. To close this gap, we reviewed two clinical guidelines and developed corresponding quality indicators. METHOD: A panel of clinicians and methodologists reviewed the National Institute for Clinical Excellence clinical guidelines for prenatal care and the list of recommended prenatal care interventions by the Research and Development Group, both based on evidence of the effectiveness of specific interventions. We have identified individual aspects in three areas: (1) utilization of services, (2) screening and (3) interventions. For each indicator we have defined: (1) suitability, ie the characteristics of the women to whom the indicator applies; (2) standard, which is the situation in which the goal is achieved;"" and (3) moderators, which are any conditions lawfully impeding the achievement of the standard. RESULTS: We developed four indicators for service utilization, 25 for screening, and 17 for intervention. The respective suitability, standard and moderator criteria were described for each indicator. While many indicators could be evaluated retrospectively using medical records, the quality of communication with the provider, screening for sensitive issues, and advice on behaviors to avoid could only be achieved with prospective data collection. CONCLUSIONS: The indicators of the quality of prenatal care, complemented by measures of social position, social support, and migrant/ethnic status, allow for a thorough characterization of the gaps in the quality of care for specific groups of women.",0,0,
876,"Stopping Antipsychotic Use in Long-Term Care (HALT): a single-arm, longitudinal study aimed at reducing inappropriate antipsychotic use in long-term care residents with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia","BACKGROUND: The inappropriate use of antipsychotics to treat behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) continues despite revised guidelines and evidence on the associated risks and side effects. The goal of the Halting Antipsychotic Use in Long-Term Care (HALT) project is to identify residents of long-term care facilities (LTC) who are taking antipsychotic medications and to implement an intervention to discontinue (or discontinue) these medications and non-pharmacological ones improve behavior management. METHODS: LTC facilities are recruited across Sydney, Australia. Inclusion criteria for residents are over 60 years of age, regularly treated with antipsychotics, and without a primary psychotic illness or very severe BPSD as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The data collection takes place one month and one week before the start of the prescription"";"" and 3, 6 and 12 months later. In the pre-description period, nursing staff will be trained on how to reduce and manage BPSD using person-centered approaches, and academic details will be provided to participants' GPs. The primary outcome measure is the reduction of regular antipsychotic medication without the use of psychotropic substitutes. Secondary outcome measures are NPI total and domain scores, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores, and adverse events including falls and hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: While previous studies have described strategies to minimize the inappropriate use of antipsychotic medications in people with dementia living in long-term care, sustainability and a prescribing culture for BPSD in elderly care remain challenges. The HALT project aims to assess the feasibility of a multidisciplinary approach to antipsychotic drug cessation in this population.",0,0,

882,"Health information, behavior modification and decision support for patients with type 2 diabetes: development of a customized, preference-sensitive health communication application","PURPOSE: Patient involvement in diabetes management, such as B. shared decision-making and patient self-management, has significant implications for clinical parameters. Adequate and preference-sensitive information for patients is a prerequisite for active participation. Interactive Health Communications Applications (IHCAs), which combine web-based patient health information with additional support, offer the opportunity to cost-effectively reach large numbers of patients and provide them with high-quality information and support at the time, place and learning speed they prefer. Nevertheless, web-based interventions often suffer from high attrition. Tailoring the intervention to patients' needs and preferences could reduce turnover and should thereby increase effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to develop a customized IHCA that provides evidence-based, preference-sensitive content and treatment decision support to patients with type 2 diabetes. The content was developed based on a needs analysis and two evidence-based treatment guidelines. The delivery format is a conversational, tunneled design that tailors the content and tone of the conversation to relevant patient characteristics (health literacy, attitudes toward self-care, and psychological barriers to insulin treatment). Both content and editing were revised by an interdisciplinary advisory board. CONCLUSION: The World Wide Web holds great potential for patient information and self-management interventions. With the development and evaluation of a tailor-made IHCA, we complement the personal discussions that patients have with their treating physicians and make them more efficient and mutually satisfying. Effects of the application are currently being tested in a randomized controlled study.",0,0,
883,"Health literacy training for public health nurses in Fukushima: a case study of program adaptation, implementation and evaluation","Health literacy encompasses not only an individual's ability to access, understand and use health information, but also the ability of health care providers to make health information accessible and usable. The Fukushima nuclear accident has posed challenges in communicating radiation-related health information. Public health nurses are the gatekeepers of community health in Japan and have primary responsibility for communicating this complex science and risk information to lay members of the community. A health literacy training program was designed to improve the communication skills of participating nurses with two main goals: changing communication practices and norms among public health nurses and improving access to information for community residents. The training content included an overview of health literacy (including numeracy), processes for evaluating written materials and visual representations, and guidelines for text improvement. The workshop extended over two days with two-hour sessions each. A proximal post-training assessment survey was conducted, followed by a more distal one-month follow-up assessment to evaluate the application of learned skills in practice. 26 nurses from Fukushima City attended the first hearing. Post-training evaluations were very positive, with 85-100% of participants agreeing on the appropriateness and usefulness of the workshop. During a month-long follow-up, the nurses reported that they applied new knowledge and skills to develop written materials. However, they struggled to share their new skills with peers and embraced the challenges of changing work norms. Participants also encountered difficulties in using graphics and explaining risks in practice. This paper underscores the importance of providing health literacy training opportunities for professionals to strengthen the health system's ability to provide accessible information and services. This program also serves as an important reference for future disaster management efforts.",0,0,
884,The attitude of health professionals to the treatment of acute diarrhea,"BACKGROUND: Traveler's diarrhea is the most common health problem in international travelers and is responsible for many consultations abroad and on return home. METHODS: A questionnaire assessing attitudes towards treatment and management of travel-related and non-travel-related diarrhea was distributed to 542 general practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists. RESULTS: Healthcare professionals' attitudes towards the management of acute diarrhea vary, with marked variation in terms of adherence to published good practice guidelines and recommendations. There are inconsistencies in the stated attitudes towards antispasmodic and antimotility drug prescribing and actual prescribing behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatment guidelines may be outdated. Inappropriate or delayed treatment puts the patient at a disadvantage. Restricting the use of antidiarrheal drugs may deny people suffering from diarrhea access to a drug that can shorten symptoms and morbidity and speed the return to normal. The review of adult diarrhea management guidelines is overdue, as is the standardization of treatment response.

There are a variety of late effects programs"";"" However, funding for these programs is limited and not accessible to all patients. Primary care providers can increasingly act as medical homes for childhood cancer (CCS) survivors. Understanding the inherent risks of cytotoxic treatment and the progressive consequences of late sequelae is crucial to limit morbidity and mortality. Adolescent and young adult survivors (AYA) are particularly prone to make health behavior choices that create risks for comorbidities. Developmentally appropriate experimentation with drug, alcohol, or tobacco use and increased exposure to UV rays increases the risk of secondary malignancies and novel diseases. The lack of evidence-based surveillance guidelines and survival-specific health promotion programs cumulatively widens the gap in noncompliance and misinformation.

It examines health practices as well as new health promotion techniques within the AYA survivor population and the role nurses play in improving health maintenance.",0,0,
886,Evaluation of health systems counseling - a critical interpretation synthesis,"Background Health systems guidelines (HSGs) are systematically developed statements that assist in making decisions about options for addressing health system challenges, including related changes in health system arrangements. However, the development, assessment and reporting of HSG poses unique conceptual and methodological challenges related to the different types of relevant evidence, the complexity of healthcare systems and the primacy of contextual factors. To fill this gap, we are conducting a research program that aims to create a tool to support the assessment of HSG and to further improve HSG development and reporting. The focus of this work was to perform a knowledge synthesis of the published and gray literature to determine quality criteria (concepts) relevant to this process. Methods We applied a critically interpretive synthesis approach (CIS) to knowledge synthesis, which allowed for an iterative, flexible, and dynamic analysis of different literature collections to create a candidate list of concepts that will form the basic components of the HSG tool. Using our review questions as a compass, we were able to direct the search strategy to look for articles based on their potential relevance to the HSG's assessment, development and reporting. The search strategy included various electronic databases and sources, specialized journals, conference abstracts, research reports, book chapters, unpublished data, dissertations, and policy documents. Paper screening and data extraction were performed independently and in duplicate, and a narrative approach to data synthesis was employed. Results We identified 43 articles that met the eligibility criteria. No existing review was found on this topic and no HSG assessment tool was identified. Over a third of the authors implicitly or explicitly identified the need for a high-quality tool aimed at systematically evaluating HSG and contributing to its development/reporting. We identified 30 concepts that might be relevant to the assessment of the HSG and were able to group them into three meaningful areas: process principles, content principles and context principles. Conclusions Our study demonstrated the role that the quality criteria play in the development, assessment and reporting of the HSG and revealed the connection and resonance within and between the different concepts in the three domains.",0,0,

Self-monitoring devices included those that help patients manage diabetes and prevent cardiovascular complications (CVCs). A secondary objective was to examine issues of feasibility, usability, and compliance among patients and providers. METHODS: Study criteria included subjects > or = 14 years and adolescents (7-14 years) with T1DM or T2DM, intervention with a self-monitoring device, assessment of clinical outcomes with the device, literature in English, and > or = 10 participants. Relevant published literature was searched from 1985 to 2008. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies were included. Data on clinical outcomes, feasibility and compliance methods and outcomes were extracted. Selected studies were independently evaluated using a validated methodological quality assessment tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were selected. The predominant types of device interventions included self-monitoring of blood glucose, pedometers, and cell phones or wireless technologies. Feasibility and compliance were measured in most studies. CONCLUSIONS: Blood glucose self-monitoring remains an effective tool in the management of diabetes. Wireless technologies can improve diabetes self-care, and pedometers are powerful lifestyle change tools. The results of this review indicate a need for additional controlled trial research on existing and emerging technologies for diabetes self-monitoring, health outcomes associated with diabetes and CVC, and device feasibility and compliance.",0,0,

BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infections pose a very real and serious threat to all who are hospitalized. Pathogens are easily transmitted to the hands of healthcare workers and hand hygiene significantly reduces this transmission. There are evidence-based guidelines for healthcare workers' hand hygiene practices, but compliance with these guidelines is low internationally. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used with an appropriate sample. As a theoretical framework, the predisposition, reinforcement, and enabling constructs in educational diagnostics and evaluation of health education theory were used, and the data were collected in 2001. beliefs and knowledge) about compliance with hand hygiene guidelines (questionnaire, n = 62). Nurses, physicians, physical therapists, and nursing assistants who work in direct patient care at the study unit participated in the study. The interventional hand hygiene program aimed to prepare medical staff for hand hygiene behavior (poster campaign and educational leaflet), reinforce the behavior (feedback on pre-test results) and enable it (provision of alcohol-based hand disinfection next to each patient bed). RESULTS: Implementation of the multifaceted interventional behavioral hand hygiene program resulted in an overall improvement in adherence to hand hygiene guidelines (51-83%, P<0.001). Additionally, healthcare workers believed their skin condition improved (P<0.001). An increase in knowledge of handwashing guidelines was also noted. CONCLUSIONS: To be effective, efforts to improve handwashing compliance must be multifaceted. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (with emollients) must be provided at the bedside of each patient. Problems related to skin irritation in healthcare workers need to be addressed urgently.",1,1,
890,The self-reported effect of an intervention program on healthcare worker knowledge and behavior related to infection control,"INTRODUCTION: Adherence to infection control guidelines is low and several efforts have been made to improve the performance of healthcare workers on infection control interventions. This study describes the implementation and evaluation of a hospital-wide infection control program. The most important measure was the distribution of an infection protection newsletter. METHODS: In evaluating the program, a randomized sample of health professionals received a questionnaire to assess the degree to which health professionals were aware of the program and whether they reported behavioral changes and refreshed knowledge as a result of the program. RESULTS: The intervention made it possible to reach >80% of the staff in a Norwegian university hospital. Of those who actually read the Infection Control Newsletter, 92.9% said their knowledge was refreshed and 60.6% reported changes in behavior. DISCUSSION: The intervention had a significant impact on nurses' and nursing assistants' reports of knowledge and behavior related to infection control. Our study supports the importance of a long-term and multimodal approach for healthcare workers when working on infection control. The time and resources devoted to the creation and distribution of the Infection Control Newsletter was an effective way to reach a large number of healthcare workers.",0,0,

892,Healthy Living After Cancer: A Dissemination and Implementation Study Evaluating a Telephone-Delivered Healthy Lifestyle Program for Cancer Survivors,"BACKGROUND: Recognizing that physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight management can improve cancer outcomes and reduce the risk of chronic disease, major cancer organizations and health authorities have endorsed guidelines for cancer survivors. Despite this and a growing evidence base of effective lifestyle interventions, there is limited uptake in survival care. METHODS/DESIGN: Healthy Living after Cancer (HLaC) is a national dissemination and implementation study that will evaluate the integration of an evidence-based lifestyle intervention for cancer survivors into an existing cancer information and support phone service provided by Australian Government Cancer Councils. Eligible participants (adults who have completed cancer treatment with curative intent) will receive 12 health coaching calls from Nurses/General Health Professionals at the Cancer Council over a 6 month period targeting national guidelines for physical activity, healthy eating and weight management . Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework, the primary outcomes are service-level indicators of program outreach, acceptability, implementation/cost, and maintenance, with secondary (efficacy) outcomes of patient-reported anthropometric, behavioral, and psychosocial variables measured before and after of the treatment were collected. program completion. The overall target for the accumulation of participants across four participating Cancer Councils is 900 over 3 years. DISCUSSION: The national scope of the project and the broad involvement of cancer survivors, in addition to assessing service level indicators, associated costs and patient-reported outcomes, will provide the necessary practice-based evidence needed to support future resource allocation of healthy living among cancer survivors.

893,"Height, body mass index and socioeconomic status: Mendelian randomization study in the UK Biobank","OBJECTIVE To determine whether height and body mass index (BMI) play a causal role in five measures of socioeconomic status. DESIGN Mendelian randomized study testing for causal effects of differences in stature and BMI on five measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian randomization exploits the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at conception and are therefore not confounded by non-genetic factors. SETTING UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS 119,669 men and women of British descent between the ages of 37 and 73. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age Full-time education completed, education completed, occupation class, annual household income, and Townsend Disadvantage Index. RESULTS In the UK Biobank study, shorter stature and higher BMI were observed to be associated with several measures of lower socioeconomic status. Associations between shorter stature and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in males, and associations between higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in females. For example, a 1 standard deviation (SD) higher BMI with a £210 (£276; $300; 95% confidence interval £84 to £420; P =6 × 10(-3)) lower annual household income in males and around 1890 £ (1680 to £2100; P=6 × 10(-15)) lower annual household income for women. Genetic analyzes demonstrated that these associations were partially causal. A genetic height of 1 SD (6.3 cm) caused a 0.06 (0.02 to 0.09) year increase in age at the completion of full-time education (P = 0.01). a 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18) times greater likelihood of working in a skilled occupation (P=6 × 10(-7)) and £1130 (£680 to £1580) higher annual household income (P=4 × 10(-8)). Associations were stronger in men. A genetically 1 SD higher BMI (4.6 kg/m(2)) caused a £1680 to £4200;"" P = 1 × 10 (-5)) lower annual household income and a 0.10 (0 .04 to 0.16) SD (P=0.001) higher levels of disadvantage only in women CONCLUSIONS These data support evidence that height and BMI play an important sub-role in determining several aspects of an individual's socioeconomic status, particularly BMI of women for income and deprivation and the height of men for education, income and occupational class.These results have important social and health implications and support the evidence that obese people, especially women, are disadvantaged and taller people, especially men, are at an advantage.",0,0,
894,Helicobacter pylori management: how to improve therapeutic confusion in practice,"There appears to be a discrepancy between current guidelines for Helicobacter pylori testing and treatment and clinical practice, including physician beliefs and actual prescribing patterns. In particular, there are clearly different approaches in primary and secondary care as well as country-specific differences in eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection. Although most physicians do not believe that Helicobacter pylori causes non-ulcer dyspepsia, the majority seem to prescribe eradication. Less information is available on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease, and there are more marked differences in attitudes and practices in this condition. Even in the case of peptic ulcer disease, where most clinicians in both primary and secondary care believe that Helicobacter pylori should be eradicated, putting this belief into practice often fails. There is also confusion regarding the treatment regimens used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori. Eradication regimens are less successful in practice than in clinical trials. Furthermore, a significant proportion of peptic ulcer patients remain symptomatic despite healing of the ulcer diathesis, which can undermine confidence. Therapeutic confusion about what to prescribe, side effects that limit compliance, bacterial resistance, and socioeconomic factors can compromise the therapeutic success of eradication therapy in practice. Unfortunately, it is well documented that policies alone are likely to have little or no impact on practice. Publication in a peer-reviewed journal is unlikely to lead to effective implementation in primary care. Based on the available evidence, clinical behavior is most likely to be modified when guidelines are developed by the clinician peer group for which they were intended, disseminated through a specific educational program, and implemented through specific reminders through use, preferably during consultation .",0,0,
895,Help doctors and patients understand health statistics,"Many doctors, patients, journalists and politicians do not understand the importance of health statistics or draw wrong conclusions without realizing it. Collective statistical illiteracy refers to the widespread inability to understand the meaning of numbers. For example, many citizens are unaware that higher survival rates with cancer screening do not mean longer lives, or that saying that mammography screening reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by 25% actually means 1 in 1,000 fewer women are dying becomes the disease. We provide evidence that statistical illiteracy (a) is common among patients, journalists and physicians”; (b) arises from opaque information gathering, which is sometimes an unintended result of a lack of understanding, but can also be the result of deliberate efforts to manipulate or persuade people; and (c) can have serious health consequences. The causes of statistical illiteracy should not be attributed solely to cognitive biases, but to the emotional nature of the doctor-patient relationship and conflicts of interest in the healthcare system. The classic doctor-patient relationship is based on (doctor) paternalism and (patient) trust in authority, which makes statistical education seem unnecessary; as well as the traditional combination of determinism (doctors look for causes, not opportunities) and the illusion of certainty (Patients seek certainty when there is none). We show that information leaflets, websites, pamphlets distributed to physicians by the pharmaceutical industry, and even medical journals often report opaquely on evidence pointing to major benefits and minor harms of the presented interventions. Without understanding the numbers involved, the public is vulnerable to political and commercial manipulation of their fears and hopes, undermining the goals of informed consent and shared decision-making. what can be done We discuss the importance of teaching statistical thinking and transparent presentations in primary, secondary and medical schools. However, this requires introducing children to the concept of probability from an early age and teaching statistical literacy as the art of solving real-world problems, rather than applying formulas to toy problems involving coins and dice. An essential prerequisite for statistical competence is transparent risk communication. We recommend using frequencies instead of single event probabilities, absolute risks instead of relative risks, mortality rates instead of survival rates, and natural frequencies instead of conditional probabilities. Psychological research on transparent visual and numerical forms of risk communication and the training of physicians in their use are required. Statistical literacy is a necessary requirement for educated citizenship in a technological democracy. Understanding and critically examining risks can also shape the emotional climate in a society, making hopes and fears less easily manipulated from outside and allowing citizens to develop a more informed and relaxed attitude towards their health.",0,1,
896,Helping hands: a cluster-randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of two different hand hygiene promotion strategies in hospital nurses,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene regulations are the most important measure to prevent hospital infections. However, compliance rates are generally below 50% of all hand hygiene opportunities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of two different strategies to promote hand hygiene among nurses in hospitals. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a cluster-randomized controlled study with inpatient wards as the unit of randomization. Hand hygiene guidelines are implemented in this study. Two strategies are being pursued to improve compliance with hand hygiene guidelines. The state-of-the-art strategy is derived from the literature and includes education, reminders, feedback and alignment with appropriate products and facilities. The expanded strategy also includes activities to influence social influence in groups and strengthen leadership. The unique contribution of the extended strategy builds on relevant behavioral science theories. The expanded strategy incorporates all elements of the state-of-the-art strategy, complemented by active commitment and initiative from the ward manager, modeling by informal leaders on the ward, and setting norms and goals within the team. The data collection takes place at four points in time at intervals of six months. At any one time, an average of 3,000 hand hygiene opportunities are observed by approximately 900 nurses. DISCUSSION: Conducting and evaluating an implementation strategy that also targets the social context of teams can significantly increase general knowledge in this area. The results of our study will allow us to draw conclusions on the impact of different strategies to implement hand hygiene guidelines and based on these results we will be able to define a preferred implementation strategy for hospital care.

897,"Helping someone with problem drug use: a Delphi consensus study of consumers, caregivers, and physicians","BACKGROUND: Problem illicit drug use (ie, substance abuse or addiction) is associated with significant health and social harm, underscoring the need for early intervention and involvement of health services. Family members, friends and colleagues play an important role in supporting and assisting people with problem drug use to seek professional help, however there are conflicting views on how and when such support should be provided. This paper reports the development of mental health first aid guidelines for adult problem drug use to inform community members how to help someone who is developing problem drug use or experiencing a drug-related crisis. METHODS: A systematic review of the academic and community literature was conducted to develop a 228-item survey containing potential first-aid strategies to help someone developing a drug problem or experiencing a drug-related crisis. Three expert panels (29 consumers, 31 caregivers, and 27 physicians) were recruited from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Panel members independently evaluated the points in three rounds, with the strategies reaching consensus on importance and being incorporated into the guidelines. RESULTS: The overall response rate over three rounds was 80% (86% consumers, 81% caregivers, 74% physicians). 140 first aid strategies were endorsed as essential or important by at least 80% of panel members. The recommended strategies provide information and advice on problem drug use and its consequences, how to approach a person about their problem drug use, tips for effective communication, what to do if the person is unwilling to change their drug use, what to do is whether the person wants (or doesn't want) professional help, what are drug-related conditions and how to manage them, how to manage side effects that lead to a medical emergency, and what to do if the person is aggressive. CONCLUSIONS: The guidelines provide a consensus-based resource for community members who want to help someone with a drug problem. It is hoped that the guidelines will lead to better support and understanding for people with problem drug use and facilitate the onboarding of professional help.",0,0,

899,Liver reactions associated with ketoconazole in the UK,"Ketoconazole was introduced in the UK in 1981. By November 1984, the Drug Safety Committee had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity related to the drug, including five deaths. An analysis of the 75 cases that were followed up appropriately found that 16, including three deaths, were likely related to treatment with the drug. Of the remainder, 48 were possibly related to treatment, five were unlikely, and six were unclassifiable. The mean age of the patients in the 16 probable cases was 57.9 years, with hepatotoxicity occurring more frequently in women. The mean duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 days. None of these well-validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment. Results of serum liver function tests indicated hepatocellular damage in 10 (63%)"";"" the rest showed a mixed pattern. In contrast, the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholestasis. The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar. Allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were rare. Hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped, with liver function test results returning to normal after an average of 3.1 months. In two of the three deaths believed to be related to treatment with ketoconazole, the drug was continued after jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis developed. Periodic clinical and biochemical monitoring for signs of hepatitis is recommended during long-term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious liver injury.",0,0,

902,Herding: a new phenomenon affecting medical decision-making in multiple sclerosis care? Lessons learned from DISCUTIR MS,"PURPOSE: Herding is a phenomenon in which individuals follow the behavior of others rather than making independent decisions based on their own private information. A herd-like phenomenon can occur in multiple sclerosis (MS) when a neurologist follows a therapeutic recommendation from a colleague, although this is not supported by best clinical practice guidelines. There is currently limited information on the role of herding in healthcare. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence (and associated factors) of herding behavior in the treatment of MS. METHODS: We conducted a study among neurologists with expertise in MS care across Spain. Participants answered questions on how to deal with 20 case scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice and completed 3 surveys and 4 experimental paradigms based on behavioral economics. The herding experiment consisted of a case study of a 40-year-old woman who had been stable on subcutaneous interferon for 3 years and developed a self-limiting neurological event. There were no new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her neurological exam and disability scores were unchanged. She was advised by an MS neurologist to switch from interferon to fingolimod, contrary to best practice guidelines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors related to herd behavior. RESULTS: Of 161 neurologists invited to participate, 96 completed the study (response rate: 60%). Herding was present in 75 (78.1%), with a similar prevalence in MS experts and general neurologists (68.8% vs. 82.8%; P=0.12). In multivariate analyses, the number of MS patients treated per week was positively associated with herd behavior (odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.14). Conversely, age, gender, years of practice, practice attitude, or physician risk preferences were not associated with hats. CONCLUSION: Herding was a common phenomenon affecting nearly 8 out of 10 neurologists caring for MS patients. Herding can influence medical decisions and lead to poorer outcomes in MS.",0,0,

904,Heterogeneous demographic and cultural profiles of Chinese American patients who do not comply with colorectal cancer screening: a latent class analysis,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death among Chinese Americans, but their CRC screening rates remain low. OBJECTIVE: We studied subgroups of Chinese American patients who did not comply with CRC screening guidelines to better inform clinical practices and effectively promote screening. METHODS: Using a latent class analysis of data from 327 participants recruited from 18 primary care clinics, we classified nonadherent patients based on sociodemographics, screening barriers, and attitudinal and clinical factors for CRC screening. RESULTS: The best fitting latent class analysis model described 3 distinct classes: western health class (36%), eastern health class (18%) and mixed health class (46%). Patients in the Western health class were highly educated, had an average US residency of 20 years, high levels of English proficiency, the least Eastern cultural views on care, and the most exposure to physician referrals, but reported no time for checkups . Eastern Health Class patients were highly educated seniors and recent immigrants with the least knowledge of CRC and the most Eastern cultural views. The mixed health class patients had a low level of education, had lived in the United States for 20 years, and half had sought the services of their physician for at least 3 years, but their knowledge and cultural views were similar to those of the eastern health class patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherent Chinese American patients are heterogeneous. It is important to have future intervention programs tailored to address specific screening beliefs and barriers for subtypes of non-adherent patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Educating primary care physicians to recognize the diverse demographics and beliefs of patients in healthcare settings can facilitate physician communication with patients to overcome their barriers and improve screening behaviors.",0,0,
905,Heterogeneous Effect of an ER Expert Diagram System,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We compare results from different modules (occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, back pain and fever in children) of the Emergency Department Expert Charting System. Each module of this electronic health record provides real-time advice based on clinical guidelines embedded in the software. METHODS: We used a tiered off-on-off punctuated time-series design with an intent-to-treat analysis to evaluate the Emergency Department Expert Charting System in a university hospital emergency room for treatment of pediatric fever, low back pain, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids. We measured quality of documentation by percentage of essential items in medical record and discharge instructions, percentage of reasonable testing and treatment decisions, mean fees per patient visit, physician satisfaction using pre- and post-trial questionnaires, and patient satisfaction by telephone Questionnaire. RESULTS: The ER Expert Charting System improved documentation rates for all modules. The emergency department's expert charting system has consistently improved the adequacy of diagnostic testing and treatment decisions for patients with occupational exposure to blood and body fluids, while reducing median costs. For the pediatric low back pain and fever modules, improvements in test and treatment appropriateness were less consistent and did not result in fee reductions. Although physicians were generally favorable to the intervention, physician use of the ED expert recording system and satisfaction with the modules was highest for occupational exposure to blood and body fluids and lowest for fever in children. For each complaint submitted, the mean patient satisfaction was highest during the ED Expert Chart System phase. CONCLUSION: The provision of guidelines through an electronic medical record with background decision support improved documentation, patient care and patient satisfaction, although the effects were heterogeneous for all complaints. The optimal strategy for implementing the guideline is likely to depend on the nature of the clinical problem and the nature of the healthcare delivery. For selected problems, the delivery of guidelines in this format over the Internet holds promise to change physician behavior and improve care (see http://www.needlestick.mednet.ucla.edu).",0,1,
906,High-risk management guidelines for elderly suicidal patients in primary care,"Older adults, particularly older white males, are more likely to commit suicide than other age groups. The assessment and treatment of suicidal ideation and behavior in older people is particularly relevant for primary care physicians, since many patients visit their physician shortly before committing suicide. In 1993, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) published clinical practice guidelines for treating depression in primary care. The AHCPR guidelines provided some guidance regarding the identification and treatment of suicidal patients. However, these guidelines lacked detailed and specific instructions for dealing with high-risk patients in the context of intervention research. The current set of guidelines builds on this earlier work by (1) describing a general approach to interacting with suicidal patients; (2) structured assessments to determine the level of suicide risk; (3) crisis intervention strategies;' and (4) ongoing management procedures for working with suicidal patients in primary care.",0,0,
907,Historical background to the changes in the FDA policy on drug testing and evaluation in women,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently made two important changes to its policy for testing and evaluating drugs in women: (1) gender-specific analyzes of drug safety and efficacy will be required as part of all new drugs, and (2) it is no longer recommended to prohibit women of childbearing potential from participating in the earliest stages of drug trials. These changes are the result of ongoing efforts to individualize therapy, improve drug safety and efficacy, and answer important questions about whether the drug development process provides adequate information about drug effects in women. These efforts, in turn, are the result of a long history in the United States of changes in the clinical care of women, changes in the use of women as research subjects, changing attitudes about the balance between protection and risk for women in clinical trials, and national movements of women to focus on health care issues and change the male-centric model of clinical research. The new FDA guidelines, released in July 1993, will guide researchers in gathering valuable information about how drugs work in women and will allow physicians and other caregivers to consider the impact of gender on health and treatment.",0,0,

DESIGN cluster randomized controlled trial. ESTABLISHING 40 public high schools in the Mexican state of Morelos. PARTICIPANTS 10 954 first graders. INTERVENTION Schools were randomly assigned to one of three streams: an HIV prevention course that promoted condom use, the same course with emergency contraception as a backup, or the existing sex education course. Self-administered anonymous questionnaires were completed at baseline, four months and 16 months. Students in intervention schools received a 30-hour (over 15 weeks) course on HIV prevention and life skills designed in accordance with the guidelines of the United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS. Two additional emergency contraceptive classes were given to students in the Condom Promotion with Contraception stream. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure was reported condom use. Other outcomes were reported sexual activity, knowledge and attitudes about HIV, and emergency contraception; and attitudes and confidence towards condom use. RESULTS The intervention had no impact on reported condom use. Knowledge about HIV improved in both intervention arms, and knowledge about emergency contraception improved in the condom advertising with contraception arm. Reported sexual behaviors were similar in the intervention arms and the control group. CONCLUSION A rigorously designed, implemented, and evaluated HIV education course in public high schools has not reduced risky behaviors, and such courses need to be redesigned and evaluated. The addition of emergency contraception did not reduce reported condom use or increase risky sexual behaviors, but it did increase reported emergency contraceptive use.",0,0,

METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3 telephone intervention groups: (1) nursing behavior management, (2) nursing and physician medication management, or (3) a combination of both. Of the 1551 eligible patients, 593 were randomized"";"" 48% were African American. The intervention phone calls were triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices. Behavior management included the promotion of health behaviors. Medication management included medication adjustment by a study physician and nurse based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was change in blood pressure control measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Both behavioral management and medication management alone showed significant improvements at 12 months - 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6% - 24.1%) and 12.5% (95% CI, 1, 3% - 23.6%) - but not at 18 months. In subgroup analyses, systolic blood pressure decreased by 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) at 12 months and by 8.0 mm Hg in those with poor baseline BP control in the combined intervention group (95% CI, -15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months relative to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention effects were moderate overall, but the effects were greater in subjects with poor blood pressure control at baseline.

METHOD: Homecare nurses (N = 98) were randomly assigned to offer their patients either Motivational Enhancement (ME); motivational interviewing + carbon monoxide feedback) or standard care (AHCPR guidelines for smoking cessation). Seventy percent of patients were eligible and willing to participate (N=273; 54% female, mean age=57 years, 83% Caucasian, 41% 0.05). ME reported more cessation attempts and a significantly greater reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked per day at all follow-ups through 12 months post-treatment (all P-values < 0.05).

914,Hormone Therapy Discontinuation: Physician Practices Following the Women's Health Initiative,"OBJECTIVE: No guidelines or randomized trials address best practices for stopping hormone therapy (HT). METHODS: We conducted a survey study to examine the practice of HT termination at Group Health and Harvard Vanguard, large integrated health care systems in the Northwest and Northeast United States, focusing on differences between specialties and study location. RESULTS: The response rate to the written questionnaire (sent between December 2005 and May 2006) was 78.5% (736/928)”; this article reports the results for 483 eligible physicians. Most physicians (91%) advised stopping oral HT gradually, not immediately (8%), and most (60%) suggested reducing both the dose and the days per week. Almost 60% of physicians reported no experience with tapering patches. Harvard Vanguard physicians were more likely than Group Health physicians to advise discontinuation of HT and are less likely to advise resuming HT if a woman's symptoms returned after stopping HT. Physicians were most influenced by their own experience (48%), the advice of colleagues (25%), and the woman's preference (19%) in choosing a stopping strategy;"" only 2% relied on research. Physicians advocated different approaches to managing symptoms after HT discontinuation, most commonly behavior modification (44%) and increased exercise (37%), and these approaches were more frequently endorsed by Harvard Vanguard physicians and OB/GYNs than by Group Health physicians or primary care physicians, or Internists. CONCLUSIONS: Two health care plans in the Northwest and Northeast United States do not have a standard protocol for discontinuing HT. Physicians have tailored approaches influenced by their location, peers, and specialty. Research is needed to validate approaches to discontinuing HT to direct HT.",0,0,

However, little data is available on the daily practice of clinicians working with smoking cancer patients. This study evaluates physicians' smoking habits, their clinical practice in providing smoking cessation interventions to smoking patients, and the training they have received in this area at a comprehensive cancer center. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to 285 physicians. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 75%. 62%, 24%, and 14% of responders were never, former, and current smokers, respectively. Six percent of all responding physicians have already attended smoking cessation training and 43% of them agreed to receive training. 86% of all responding physicians asked about patients' smoking status, 50% routinely advised patients to quit smoking, and 32% rated their motivation for doing so. Smoking cessation guidelines were not followed mainly due to lack of time, fear of increasing patient stress, and lack of smoking cessation education. 94% of the responding physicians were aware of the outpatient smoking cessation service and 65% referred at least one patient, 66% of the responding physicians were aware of the inpatient service and 36% of them requested at least one procedure on the ward. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated partial adherence to smoking cessation guidelines by physicians at a leading cancer center.

919,How did formative research influence the development of a women's group intervention in rural Nepal?,"The inability to reduce neonatal and maternal mortality in poor countries is sometimes attributed to a lack of contextual knowledge of caregiving practices and behaviors. There is a lack of knowledge on how to translate formative research into effective interventions to improve maternal and newborn health. We describe the results of the formative research and how they were used to inform the development of such an intervention in rural Nepal. Formative research was conducted in four parts. Part 1 included study area familiarization and literature review, and Parts 2, 3, and 4 included community mapping, health services review, and qualitative and quantitative studies of perinatal caregiving behaviors. Participatory approaches have proven successful in reducing neonatal mortality and may be appropriate in our context. Community mapping and profiling helped describe the community context, and we found that community-based organizations often attempted to involve the female community health volunteer in community mobilization. She did not routinely hold monthly meetings and found it difficult to maintain them without support and oversight. In health care facilities, most primary care workers were posted, but referral centers lacked physicians and nurses. Mortality estimates reflected under-reporting of deaths, and hygiene and infection control strategies had poor coverage. Most women give birth at home with their mother-in-law, friends and neighbors. Care during perinatal illnesses was usually sought from traditional healers. Cultural issues such as shyness, fear, and normality constrained women's behavior during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, and decisions about their health were usually made after communicating with family and community. The formative research indicated the type of intervention that could be successful. It should be community based and not exclusively for pregnant women. It should address negotiations within families and tailor information to the needs of local groups and specific stakeholders such as mothers-in-law and traditional healers. The intervention should not only accept cultural constructs, but also be a forum to discuss ideas of pollution, shame and seclusion. We used these guidelines to develop a participatory, community-based women's group intervention facilitated through a community cycle of action. The success of our intervention may be due to their acceptance at the community level and their sensitivity to the needs and beliefs of families and communities.",0,0,
920,How do clinicians prefer cultural competence training? Results from the DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview Field Trial,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze training methods rated as most helpful and least helpful by clinicians during the DSM-5 field trial with cultural formulation interviews, to analyze reasons for this, and to analyze associations between demographic characteristics and method preferences. METHOD: The authors used mixed methods to analyze interviews with 75 clinicians on five continents about their training preferences after a standardized training session and the first time clinicians conducted the Cultural Formulation Interview. The content analysis identified the most and least helpful educational methods by reason. The bivariate and logistic regression analysis compared clinical characteristics with method preferences. RESULTS: Most frequently, clinicians cited case-based behavioral simulations as ""most helpful"" and video as ""least helpful"" training methods. Bivariate and logistic regression models, first unadjusted and then clustered by country, found that each additional year of physician age was associated with a preference for behavioral simulations: OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.10"" ;"" p=0.025) . CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians preferred active behavioral simulations in cultural skills training, and this effect was most pronounced in older clinicians. Effective training is best achieved through a combination of written policy reviews, video demonstrations, and behavioral simulations. Future work may examine the impact of satisfaction with clinical training on patient symptoms and quality of life.",0,0,
921,How does the self-reported clinical treatment of patients with back pain relate to the attitudes and beliefs of healthcare professionals? A survey of UK GPs and physiotherapists,"Guidelines for the management of low back pain (LBP) have existed for many years, but compliance by healthcare professionals (HCPs) remains suboptimal. The aim of this study was to measure the attitudes, beliefs and reported clinical behaviors of UK physiotherapists (PTs) and general practitioners (GPs) about LBP and to explore the associations between these. A cross-sectional postal survey of primary care physicians (n=2000) and PTs (n=2000) was conducted that included the Pain Attitude and Belief Scale (PABT.PT) and a vignette of a patient with nonspecific LBP (NSLBP). with questions about recommendations for work, activity, and bed rest. Data from 1022 respondents (442 GPs and 580 PTs) who had recently treated patients with LBP were analyzed. Although the majority of HCPs indicated that they had given advice to vignette patients that was broadly in line with guideline recommendations, 28% indicated that they would advise this patient not to work. Job counseling was significantly related to PABS.PT scores, with higher biomedical (F(1,986)=77.5, p<0.0001) and lower behavioral (F(1,981)=31.9, p<0.001) scores associated with the advice to stay away from work. We have shown that UK GPs' and PTs' attitudes and reported practice behavior towards patients with NSLBP differ. Many HCPs believed that LBP required some avoidance of activities and work. The attitudes and beliefs of these HCPs were linked to their self-reported clinical behaviors regarding advice about work. Future studies need to investigate whether approaches aimed at modifying these HCP factors can lead to improved patient outcomes.",0,0,
922,How many steps/day is enough? for children and young people,"Global physical activity public health guidelines place particular emphasis on child (typically 6-11 years) and adolescent (typically 12-19 years) populations. Existing guidelines are usually expressed in terms of frequency, time and intensity of the behavior. However, simple step output from both accelerometers and pedometers is gaining credibility in research and practice as a reasonable approximation of daily ambulatory physical activity volume. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the existing literature on objectively monitored step-based physical activity in children and adolescents in order to provide researchers, practitioners, and laypersons using accelerometers and pedometers with evidence-based translations of these public health guidelines in relation to steps for to provide / day. In terms of normative data (ie expected values), the updated international literature indicates that 1) we can expect children to average 12,000 to 16,000 steps/day and girls to average 10,000 to 13,000 steps/day” and 2) adolescents to Decrease steadily every day until approximately 8,000-9,000 steps/day are observed in 18-year-olds. Controlled cadence studies show that continuous MVPA walking produces 3,300-3,500 steps in 30 minutes or 6,600-7,000 steps in 60 minutes 10- to 15- Year-olds: Limited evidence suggests that a daily volume of physical activity totaling 10,000 to 14,000 steps/day is associated with 60 to 100 minutes of MVPA in preschool-aged children (approximately 4 to 6 years). Across studies, 60 minutes of MVPA in elementary/elementary school children appears to be achieved on average within a total volume of 13,000 to 15,000 steps/day in boys and 11,000 to 12,000 steps/day in girls, in adolescents (both boys and girls) 10,000 to 11,700 can be paced 60 miles are associated nutrients from MVPA. Translations of time- and intensity-based guidelines may be higher than existing normative data (eg, in adolescents) and are therefore more difficult to achieve (but not impossible or contraindicated). The recommendations are preliminary and more research is needed to confirm and extend the values for measured cadences, associated speeds and MET values in young people; continue to collect normative data (expected values) for both steps/day and MVPA across age groups and populations;"" and to conduct longitudinal and interventional studies in children and adolescents needed to provide information on the shape of the staged dose-response To obtain curves of physical activity associated with various health parameters.",0,0,

924,How organizational escalation prevention potentials affect the implementation success of innovations: Electronic patient files in hospitals,"Background Escalation of engagement is the tendency for (innovation) projects to continue even when it is clear that they will not be successful and/or become extremely costly. Escalation Prevention Potential (EPP), an organization's ability to stop or control implementation processes that are not meeting their expectations, can prevent an organization from wasting time and money on unsuccessful projects. EPP is a set of checks and balances built into management practices that can protect management from irrational (yet very human) decisions and limit the escalation of implementation projects. We examine whether the successful implementation of electronic medical records (EMRs) is related to EPP and examine the organizational factors responsible for this relationship. Methods Structural equation modeling (SEM) using questionnaire data from 427 physicians and 631 nurses experienced in the implementation and use of EMRs in hospitals was applied to examine whether formal governance and organizational culture alter the relationship between EPP and the perceived value of mediate EMRs. Results Physicians and nurses in hospitals with more EPPs report more successful implementation of EMR (in terms of perceived added value of EMR). Formal governance conveys the connection between EPP and implementation success. We found no evidence that an open or innovative culture explains the relationship between EPP and implementation success. Conclusions There is a positive correlation between the EPP level and the perceived added value of EMRs. This relationship is explained through formal organizational governance mechanisms. This gives management a solid set of tools to positively influence the success of innovation processes. But it also means that management must be able to critically reflect on its (past) actions and decisions, and be willing to change plans if elements of EPP indicate that the implementation process will be hindered.",0,0,
925,How remuneration systems affect the care behavior of doctors - an experimental study,"Understanding how physicians respond to reimbursement incentives is a central concern of health economics research. We conduct a controlled laboratory experiment to analyze the impact of fee and per capita incentives on physician service delivery. In our experiment, physicians select sets of medical services for patients with different health conditions. We find that physicians provide significantly more services based on effort than on effort. Patients are oversupplied when it comes to fee payments and undersupplied when it comes to per capita payments. However, incentives to pay are not the only motivation for physicians' volume decisions, as patient health benefits are also of significant importance. We find that patients who require a high (low) level of medical care receive greater care at a per-service (per-fee) basis.",0,1,
926,How Science Thinks and How Practice Acts: Bridging the Gap in Adolescent Weight Control Interventions,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent obesity requires evidence-based treatment approaches given its long-term physical and psychosocial consequences. However, research shows that there are many problems in translating scientific knowledge into practice. AIM: The aim of this study was to develop science- and practice-based recommendations for planning future weight management interventions in adolescents. METHODS: We conducted (i) literature searches on intervention studies on adolescent obesity management and Dutch clinical guidelines for obesity, as well as practice-based documents and gray literature on obesity management and adolescent health program delivery, and (ii) semi-structured studies through interviews with eight clinicians and four non-clinicians working in the treatment, management, and prevention of obesity to explore prospects for treating adolescent obesity and to use evidence in practice. RESULTS: After pooling the results from literature reviews and interviews, four problems emerged: (i) little reporting on theoretical models used in intervention studies, Dutch clinical guidelines and semi-structured interviews; (ii) inconsistency in age-specific considerations for treatment of adolescent obesity in intervention studies and Dutch clinical guidelines;"" (iii) inconsistency in addressing the social nature of obesity in intervention studies and Dutch clinical guidelines, and (iv) how professional responsibility should be shared , is unclear from intervention studies, Dutch clinical guidelines and semi-structured interviews.CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions require joint action between science and practice.Future interventions should include issues relevant to the stage of adolescence and focus more on the complex social nature of obesity Finally, practitioners can generate more practice-based evidence by starting their own practice-based research.",0,0,

928,How to improve medical and public acceptance and application of colorectal cancer screening recommendations,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is a multidisciplinary effort that aims to reduce mortality and incidence from CRC without compromising the health status of participants. Adopting a public health perspective requires a commitment to ensure equitable access and the sustainability of the program over time. We reviewed available evidence on predictors of CRC screening uptake and the effects of interventions to improve screening acceptance using conceptual frameworks that define the role of determinants of preventive behavior and the scope and goal of interventions. The results of this review indicate that policies to support the delivery of screening, as well as organizational changes that affect the operational characteristics of preventive services, need to be implemented so that individual motivation can eventually be realized. To ensure coverage and equitable access, and to maximize the impact of the intervention, strategies should be adopted to implement organized programs that ensure that financial barriers do not limit participation in screening and any follow-up assessment. Participant and provider beliefs can determine responses to different screening modalities. To achieve the desired health outcome, an active follow-up of individuals with screening abnormalities should be undertaken, supported by the introduction of infrastructural changes and multidisciplinary teamwork that can ensure the sustainability of effective interventions over time. Ongoing monitoring and the adoption of plans to evaluate program effectiveness are critical steps in implementing a successful program.",0,1,
929,How to implement clinical practice guidelines in Iran,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine would result through evidence-based implementation. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) as one of the evidence-based knowledge products require appropriate interventions after they are created in order to be applied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this qualitative study was to identify the strategies for the application of Iranian-made CPGs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Targeted snowball sampling was performed and continued until theoretical saturation was reached. Detailed semi-structured individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) were conducted with the aim of triangulation. The thematic framework approach was used for the analysis. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were conducted with three policy makers and health system decision makers, four with experience in producing or adapting clinical practices, and five experts in the development and education of evidence-based medicine. In addition, 11 policy makers, managers and health system decision makers participated in FGD. The proposed interventions were grouped into the following themes: health worker-centred, financial, organizational, regulatory, and multifaceted interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Along with the process of adapting and developing CPGs, their use should also be planned"";"" otherwise the time and money spent would be wasted. Certainly, enforcing the above interventions with the ultimate goal of sustainable behavioral change among health care providers is beyond the capacity of any particular group or fewer academic centers.

930,How do you translate therapy recommendations in clinical practice guidelines into rules for criticizing medical prescriptions? Methods and application to five guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines provide recommendations on what to do in different medical settings, including therapeutic recommendations for drug prescribing. An effective way to computerize these recommendations is to design critical decision support systems, i.e. systems that criticize the doctor's prescription when it does not follow guidelines. These systems are usually based on a list of ""if conditions, then criticism"" rules. However, writing these rules from the guidelines is not a trivial task. The aim of this article is to propose methods that (1) simplify the translation of therapeutic recommendations from guidelines into systems of criticism by automatically translating structured therapeutic recommendations into a list of “if conditions, then criticize” rules, and (2) generate an appropriate text label to explain to the physician why his/her prescription is not recommended. METHODS: We worked on the therapeutic recommendations in five clinical practice guidelines on chronic diseases related to cardiovascular risk management. We evaluated the system on a test basis of more than 2000 cases. RESULTS: Algorithms for automatically translating therapy recommendations into ""if conditions then criticize"" rules are presented. It also proposes eight general recommendations"";"" They are guideline independent and can be used as default behaviors for dealing with various situations usually implied in the guidelines, such as: B. reducing the dose of a poorly tolerated drug. Finally, we provide models and methods for generating a human-readable textual critique. The system was successfully evaluated on the test basis. Conclusion: We show that it is possible to criticize and understand medical prescriptions based on a structured clinical guideline. We are now planning a randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of the system on practice.",0,0,
931,How well do clinicians follow dementia practice guidelines?,"Although there are numerous clinical guidelines on the management of dementia, there are few studies on their implementation in practice. Clinicians at six United States Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers (n=200, 85% response rate) were surveyed regarding their use of the practices recommended in the California Workgroup guidelines for the management of Alzheimer's disease. The majority of providers (89% to 73%) reported that they routinely performed neurological exams, obtained medical histories from caregivers, discussed the diagnosis with the patient's family, discussed a permanent power of attorney, and prepared statutory reports on drivers with dementia. About two-thirds of providers reported routinely performing cognitive screening, screening for depression, reporting elder abuse, and discussing care needs and decision-making issues with patients' families. Only half of all outpatient providers established care practices for at least half of their patients. Clinicians' drug choices for cognition, mood, and behavior problems were broadly consistent with current practice guidelines. These results suggest possible priorities for quality improvement efforts.

936,Hypertension Improvement Project (HIP): Study protocol and implementation challenges,"BACKGROUND: Hypertension affects 29% of the US adult population and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. Despite numerous effective treatments, only 53% of people with hypertension achieve their blood pressure goal. The chronic care model suggests that blood pressure control can be achieved by patients and physicians improving patient self-care. METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes the protocol of a nested 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial to test the separate and combined effects of a behavioral intervention for patients and a quality improvement-type intervention for physicians on systolic blood pressure. General practitioner practices were randomly assigned to the medical intervention or the medical control condition. The physicians were randomized at the clinic level. Medical intervention included training and performance monitoring. The training consisted of two web-based modules that outlined both the JNC-7 hypertension guidelines and lifestyle changes for hypertension. Performance data was collected for 18 months and feedback was provided to physicians every 3 months. Patients attending both intervention and control clinics were individually randomized to patient intervention or usual care. Patient intervention consisted of a 6-month behavioral intervention delivered by trained interventionists in 20 group sessions, followed by 12 monthly telephone contacts by community health workers. Follow-up measurements were carried out after 6 and 18 months. The primary endpoint was the mean change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary endpoints were diastolic blood pressure and the proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control at 6 and 18 months. DISCUSSION: A total of 8 practices (4 per treatment group), 32 physicians (4 per practice; 16 per treatment group) and 574 patients (289 control and 285 intervention patients) were included. Baseline characteristics of patients and providers and challenges in conducting the study are presented. The HIP interventions can improve blood pressure control and reduce cardiovascular disease risk in a primary care setting by addressing key components of the chronic care model. The study design allows for separate assessments of the effectiveness and costs of interventions by physicians and patients, allowing healthcare organizations to make informed decisions about implementing either or both interventions in the context of local resources.

937,Hypertension Improvement Project: Randomized Study of Quality Improvement for Physicians and Lifestyle Modification for Patients,"Despite widespread high blood pressure treatment guidelines for physicians and lifestyle recommendations for patients, blood pressure control rates remain low. In community-based primary care hospitals, we conducted a nested, 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial of physician intervention versus control and/or patient intervention versus control. Physician intervention included internet-based training, self-monitoring, and quarterly feedback reports. Patient intervention consisted of 20 weekly group sessions followed by 12 monthly telephone counseling sessions, and focused on weight loss, nutritional approaches to control hypertension, dietary patterns, exercise, and reduced sodium intake. The primary endpoint was change in systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Eight primary care practices (32 doctors) were randomly assigned to a medical intervention or control group. Within these practices, 574 patients were randomized to patient intervention or control groups. The mean age of the patients was 60 years, 61% were women and 37% were black. Blood pressure data were available for 91% of patients at 6 months. The main effect of the physician's intervention on systolic blood pressure at 6 months adjusted to baseline was 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.2 inches; P=0.72). The main effect of the patient's intervention was 2.6 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.4 to 0.7; P=0.01). The interaction of the two interventions was significant (P=0.03), with the greatest effect being observed in the combination of physician and patient intervention (9.7 +/- 12.7 mm Hg). Differences between the treatment groups did not persist after 18 months. Combined doctor-patient interventions lower blood pressure.” Future research should focus on improving the effectiveness and sustainability of these interventions.",0,0,

A better understanding of racial disparities in hypertension in relation to risk factors, patient/physician behavior and patient outcomes is key to improving racial care for black patients. Recent data suggest that black patients progress more quickly from prehypertension to hypertension, underscoring the need for early and immediate intervention. Unfortunately, adherence and persistence to antihypertensive therapy in black patients is generally poor and is compounded by the increased need for multidrug therapy in this patient population.

939,Identification and assessment of the salient beliefs of colorectal cancer survivors about physical activity,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has been associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence and longer survival in colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. however, less than one-third of CRC survivors meet PA guidelines. Interventions to promote PA in CRC survivors need to understand the most critical beliefs that influence PA behavior. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the strength of associations between the most common PA beliefs of CRC survivors and motivational constructs from Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and PA behavior. INTERVENTION/METHODS: Colon cancer survivors (n=600) residing in Alberta, Canada, completed self-report questionnaires that assessed medical and demographic variables, PA beliefs, constructs from the TPB, and PA behaviors. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer survivors identified improved fitness (69.5%), family members (67.3%), and medical/health problems (8.8%) as the most prevalent behavioral, norm, and control beliefs, respectively. All PA beliefs were significantly correlated with all TPB constructs and PA. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity interventions for CRC survivors should target many salient beliefs, including behavioral, normative, and control loci.

940,Identifying perceived barriers to pain management in Iranian children: a qualitative study,"Children in the hospital often receive inadequate treatment for their pain. Pediatric nurses experience these inadequacies more often than other members of the healthcare team. This research was an attempt, in the form of a phenomenological study, to uncover some of the major barriers to pain management in children, as perceived by caregivers. Sixteen nurses were interviewed in the medical, surgical and infectious pediatric departments of a hospital in Iran. The data analysis was based on the Colaizzi method, which revealed three main issues in different areas, namely: organizational barriers, limitations related to the child's characteristics, and barriers related to the nature of the disease and its treatment. Study results have revealed organizational limitations that add to the lack of authority to perform some medical procedures, inadequate equipment and supplies, and the unavailability of opioids as the most important pain-controlling and limiting factors. Other factors related to the child's characteristics, such as age, temperament, behavior, expression and gender influence the assessment and management of pain. The results showed identified barriers in real context. It seems that some guidelines are needed to achieve optimal pain management.",0,0,
941,"Identification, assessment and management of obesity in an academic primary care center","BACKGROUND: The rapidly increasing prevalence of childhood obesity is one of the most difficult dilemmas facing pediatricians today. As the medical community struggles to develop effective strategies to treat this epidemic, timely detection of obesity by pediatric healthcare providers remains the critical first step in obesity management. OBJECTIVE: A direct assessment of the performance of pediatric clinicians in the detection and management of obesity in clinical practice has not been conducted. The aim of this study was to determine the detection rates of obesity by pediatric residents, nurses, and faculty members in a primary care academic setting and to describe the actions taken by these providers in their assessment and management of obesity. DESIGN: A retrospective review of the medical records of all health surveillance visits for children aged 3 months to 16 years examined between December 1, 2001 and February 28, 2002 was performed. In children, 120% of the 50th percentile of body weight was defined as obese. For children > or = 5 years, a body mass index > 95th percentile for age and sex was defined as obese. FACILITIES: A large primary care practice in a tertiary-care academic children's hospital serving a predominantly urban minority (70% African American) who are insured for medical assistance (90%). PARTICIPANTS: Primary care providers, including paediatricians, nurse practitioners, and faculty physicians. RESULTS: Of the 2515 visits examined, a total of 244 patients met the study definition of obesity, yielding an estimated prevalence of obesity visits of 9.7% among health surveillance visits for children aged 3 months to 16 years. This prevalence of obesity visits cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of obesity in the population because of the skewed distribution of visits among very young children. For all children who met the study definition of obesity, providers documented obesity in their assessments in only 53% of the visits reviewed (129 visits). Although the majority of the charts (69%) included an appropriate dietary history, only 15% included a description of the child's activity level or television viewing. Physical examination revealed obesity in 39% of cases. In children for whom obesity was identified as a problem by their physicians (129 patients), 81% of the charts included an appropriate dietary history, while 27% included a description of the child's activity level or television viewing. Physical examination revealed obesity in 64% of cases. Most children identified as obese by their providers received treatment specifically targeted for their obesity, including education, screening, and referral to a specialist. Dietary changes were recommended for 71%, increasing activity for 33% and reducing TV viewing for only 5%. 83% of providers recommended close follow-up. Other recommendations included referral to a dietician (22%), screening laboratory studies (13%), a food diary (9%), endocrine disease referral (5%), or referral to preventive cardiology (3%). The identification of the obesity provider was influenced by the age of the patient and by the degree of obesity. Obesity detection was lowest in preschool children (31%) and highest in adolescent patients (76%). Providers who screened older and heavier children were also more likely to collect activity histories, note obesity on physical exam, recommend changes in activity, refer the patient to a dietitian, obtain screening laboratory studies, and recommend close follow-up. The identification of obesity and other outcome variables were not significantly affected by physician training level or patient gender. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of childhood obesity has now reached epidemic proportions, it has been under-recognized and under-treated by pediatric primary care physicians in our study. Providers identified obesity as a problem for only half of the obese children screened for health surveillance. The lowest rates of obesity identification occurred in children under 5 years of age and those with milder degrees of obesity. Identification did not improve with additional years of pediatric education. Even for the subset of children classified as obese by their providers, evaluation and treatment often fell short of current recommendations. For example, more attention has been paid to the role of diet versus activity in assessing obesity. In particular, only a small number of providers (5%) recommended reducing television viewing for their obese patients, although there was evidence of an association between television viewing and pediatric obesity. This finding is worrying because obesity is known to be a multifactorial disease that only responds to significant changes in both diet and activity behaviors. Only 13% of providers requested laboratory testing as part of their referrals. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends profiling lipids, total cholesterol, and a screening test for type 2 diabetes mellitus as part of the obesity assessment. The majority of physicians who requested laboratory studies included thyroid function tests, which the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend because of the very low likelihood of hypothyroidism as a cause of obesity. Although the level of assessment and management for children identified as obese did not meet current guidelines, it was far superior to that for patients not identified as obese by their providers. This demonstrates the importance of timely detection as a crucial first step in treating obesity. The results of this study are discouraging, especially given the growing evidence of the importance of early intervention in preventing the medical and psychosocial consequences of obesity, as well as the persistence of obesity into adulthood. This study underscores the need for greater awareness and identification of obesity in primary care, particularly among younger children and those with mild obesity.",0,0,
942,Identify and reduce errors with surgical simulation,"The most important determinant of a patient's safety and outcome is the skill and judgment of the surgeon.

Innovative, state-of-the-art simulation devices that train both surgical tasks and skills without risk to patients should enable the detection and analysis of errors and ""near misses"". Studies have validated the use of a sophisticated Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ES3) simulator for procedural training of residents. It is currently being evaluated whether the integration of a comprehensive ES3 training program into the residency curriculum will have a long-term impact on surgical performance and patient outcomes. Using different ENT residencies, subjects will be exposed to supervised training on the ES3 as well as minimally invasive trainers such as the MIST-VR. Technical errors are identified and quantified on the simulator and intraoperatively. Individual performance can be compared with a national standard via a web-based database. An updated version of the ES3 is being developed that will support patient-specific anatomical models.

Information gleaned from these studies will help usher in the next generation of surgical simulators, which are expected to have a significant impact on patient safety.",0,1,
943,"Identifying the barriers and requirements to triage, treatment, and transfer of clinical interventions to treat acute stroke patients in the emergency department: a systematic review using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)","BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend that evaluation and treatment of patients with stroke begin early, including in the emergency department (ED). To inform the development of an ED-focused implementation intervention, we conducted a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies to identify relevant barriers and enablers for six key clinical behaviors in acute stroke care: appropriate triage, thrombolytic administration, monitoring, and management of the Temperature, blood glucose levels and dysphagia and transfer of stroke patients to ED. METHODS: Studies of any type conducted in the emergency department that identified barriers or enablers based on primary data for one or more of these six clinical behaviors. Major biomedical databases (CINAHL, OVID SP EMBASE, OVID SP MEDLINE) were searched using comprehensive search strategies. The barriers and enablers were categorized using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The behavior modification technique (BCT) that best fitted the strategy that each enabler represented was selected for each of the reported enablers using a standard taxonomy. RESULTS: Of the 44 studies identified, five qualitative studies and four surveys met the selection criteria. The majority of the reported barriers corresponded to the TDF domains ""environment, context and resources"" (e.g. stressful working conditions or lack of resources) and ""knowledge"" (e.g. lack of guideline awareness or familiarity). The majority of enablers corresponded to the areas of 'knowledge' (e.g. educating physicians about the calculated risk of bleeding after intravenous thrombolysis [tPA]) and 'skills' (e.g. providing the ability to treat stroke cases of varying complexity). The total number of BCTs assigned was 18. The most commonly assigned BCTs to reported enablers were 'Focus on past achievements' and 'Information on health outcomes'. CONCLUSIONS: Obstacles and prerequisites for the delivery of important evidence-based protocols in an emergency setting were identified and interpreted within a relevant theoretical framework. This new knowledge has since been used to select specific BCTs to implement evidence-based care in an ED setting. It is recommended that findings from similar future reviews follow a similar theoretical approach. In particular, the use of existing matrices to support the selection of relevant BCTs.",0,0,
944,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Prevailing and evolving hypotheses about its pathogenesis and implications for therapy,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and usually fatal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling, resulting in irreversible distortion of lung architecture. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms have yet to be determined, the prevailing hypothesis is that fibrosis is preceded and provoked by a chronic inflammatory process that injures the lung and modulates pulmonary fibrogenesis, resulting in an end-stage fibrotic scar. However, there is little evidence that inflammation is prominent in the early stages of the disease, and it is unclear whether inflammation is relevant to the development of the fibrotic process. There is evidence that inflammation does not play a critical role. Inflammation is not a prominent histopathologic finding, and epithelial injury in the absence of ongoing inflammation is sufficient to stimulate the development of fibrosis. In addition, the inflammatory response to fibrogenic pulmonary infarction is not necessarily related to the fibrotic response. Clinical measures of inflammation do not correlate with stage or outcome, and effective anti-inflammatory therapy does not improve outcome. This review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis involves abnormal wound healing in response to multiple microscopic sites of persistent alveolar epithelial injury and activation associated with the formation of patchy fibroblast-myofibroblast foci that progress to fibrosis . Advances in understanding the fibrogenic mechanisms in the lungs will likely lead to more effective therapies.",0,0,

946,Influence of a clinical decision support system on antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care: quasi-experimental study,"Objective To evaluate the effect of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) integrated with an electronic health record (EHR) on antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in primary care. Materials and methods Quasi-experimental design with nine intervention practices and 61 control practices in the Practice Partner Research Network, a network of practices all using the same EPA (Practice Partner). The nine intervention practices were located in nine US states. The design included a 3-month baseline data collection (October to December 2009) prior to the introduction of the intervention and 15 months of follow-up (January 2010 to March 2011). The key outcome measures were antibiotic prescription for ARI episodes for which antibiotics are inappropriate and broad spectrum antibiotic prescription for all ARI episodes. Results In adult patients, antibiotic prescribing for ARI episodes when antibiotics are inappropriate decreased more in intervention practices (-0.6%) than in control practices (+4.2%) (p=0.03). In adults, however, CDSS intervention improved broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing, with a 16.6% decrease in intervention practices versus a 1.1% increase in control practices (p<0.0001). A similar effect on the prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics was seen in pediatric patients with a 19.7% decrease in intervention practices compared to a 0.9% increase in control practices (p<0.0001). Conclusions CDSS embedded in an electronic medical record had a modest impact on changing adult prescriptions when antibiotics were inappropriate, but had a significant impact on changing overall prescriptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics in pediatric and adult patients.",0,1,
947,Effects of a computerized clinical decision support system on reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use: a randomized controlled trial.,"Objective: Many hospitals are using antimicrobial management teams (AMTs) to improve patient care. However, most work with minimal computer assistance. We evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a computer-assisted clinical decision support system for the management of antimicrobial use. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study in adult hospitalized patients between May 10 and August 3, 2004. Antimicrobial use was managed by an existing AMT, using the system in the intervention arm and without the system in the control arm. The system is designed to alert the AMT to potentially inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Measurements: Outcomes assessed were hospital expenditure on antimicrobials, mortality, length of hospital stay, and time spent administering antimicrobial use. Results: The AMT intervened in 359 (16%) of 2,237 patients in the intervention arm and in 180 (8%) of 2,270 in the control arm, while spending approximately one hour less each day in the intervention arm. Spending on in-hospital antibiotics was $285,812 in the intervention arm and $370,006 in the control arm, a savings of $84,194 (23%), or $37.64 per patient. No significant difference in mortality (3.26% vs. 2.95%, p=0.55) or length of hospital stay (3.84 vs. 3.99 days, p=0.38) was observed. Conclusion: Using the system facilitated the management of antimicrobial use by allowing the AMT to intervene in more patients receiving inadequate antimicrobial therapy and achieving significant time and cost savings for the hospital. This is the first study to demonstrate in a patient randomized controlled trial that computerized clinical decision support systems can improve existing antimicrobial management programs.",0,1,
948,Influence of a computerized decision support system on policy adherence to antibiotics prescribed for urinary tract infections in emergency departments: a multicenter prospective controlled intervention study before and after,"Targets Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a leading reason for antibiotic prescriptions in emergency departments (EDs), with half of these antibiotics being improperly prescribed. Our aim was to assess the impact of a computerized decision support system (CDSS) on adherence to guidelines on empiric antibiotic prescribing (antibiotics and duration) for UTIs in EDs. Methods From March 19 to October 28, 2012, a multicenter, prospective, controlled intervention study was conducted. All adults diagnosed with community-acquired UTI (cystitis, pyelonephritis, or prostatitis) in three French emergency departments were included. Antibiotic therapy was considered guideline-compliant when the antibiotic and the prescribed duration met national guidelines. The data was collected using electronic patient files. Paired tests were used when comparing periods within each ED, and global analyzes used multivariate logistic mixed models. Results Nine hundred and twelve patients were enrolled during the 30-week study period. The CDSS was used in 59% of cases (182/307). CDSS intervention improved antibiotic prescription compliance in only one ED in a bivariate analysis (absolute increase +20%, P?=?0.007). Antibiotic choice was improved in multivariate analyses, but only when the CDSS was used [OR?=?1.94 (95% CI 1.13-3.32)]. The CDSS also changed the initial diagnosis in 23% of cases in all three EDs. Conclusions The CDSS only partially improved adherence to antibiotic prescribing guidelines in UTIs.",0,1,
949,Effects of a computerized template on prescribing antibiotics for acute respiratory infections in children and adolescents,"Background. Computerized decision support (CDS) can potentially improve patient safety and guideline compliance. Authors developed an interactive acute respiratory disease (ARI-IT) template within an electronic health record (EHR) to manage pediatric ARIs and assessed the impact on antibiotic prescribing. methods. They randomized 12 practices to receive either the ARI-IT or the control group. Antibiotic rates of all candidate ARI diagnoses were compared at control and intervention ARI visits, controlling for grouping by clinician. Results. There was no difference in the total number of antibiotic prescriptions between control and intervention clinics. Use of the ARI-IT reduced antibiotic prescribing (31.7% vs. 39.9%; P=0.02) and macrolide use (6.2% vs. 9.5%; P=0, 02) in the visits compared to the eligible visits where it was not used. Conclusion. Use of the CDS reduced antibiotic and macrolide prescriptions in children with ARI. Nonetheless, the low overall utilization led to an ineffective intervention.",0,1,
950,Effects of a multifaceted intervention on cholesterol management in primary care offices: guideline adherence for a randomized heart health trial,"Background Physicians' adherence to the National Cholesterol Education Program clinical practice guidelines was inadequate. Methods We recruited 68 primary care and internal medicine practices; 66 were randomly assigned to a study arm; 5 practices dropped out, resulting in 29 receiving the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) intervention and 32 receiving an alternative intervention focused on the Seventh Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment report of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7). ATP III providers received a personal digital assistant who provided the Framingham risk scores and ATP III treatment recommendations. All practices received copies of each clinical practice guideline, an introductory lecture, 1 performance feedback report, and 4 visits for procedure-specific scientific detailing. Data were drawn at 61 practices from random samples of medical records of patients treated from June 1 through May 31, 2003 (baseline) and from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2006 (follow-up) The proportion was screened with subsequent appropriate decision n manufacture (primary outcome) was calculated. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare results by arm, accounting for clustering of patients within practices. Results We examined 5,057 medical records at baseline and 3,821 follow-up visits. The screening rate for lipid levels increased from 43.6% to 49.0% (ATP III practices) and from 40.1% to 50.8% (control practices) (net difference -5.3% [p=0.22] ). Adequate management of lipid levels decreased slightly (73.4% to 72.3%) in the ATP III practices and more significantly (79.7% to 68.9%) in the control practices. The net change in appropriate management favored the intervention (+9.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.8%-16.6% [p<0.01]). Adequate drug prescription at 4 months decreased in both arms (38.8% to 24.8% in ATP III practices and 45.3% to 24.1% in control practices; net change, +7.2% [P = 0.37]). Overtreatment decreased from 6.6% to 3.9% in ATP III and increased from 4.2% to 6.4% in control practices (net change -4.9% [P=0.01]) Conclusions A multifactor Intervention, including personal digital assistant-based decision support, can improve primary care physician adherence to ATP III guidelines.",0,1,
951,Impact of a multifaceted intervention on nurses' and physicians' attitudes and behavior towards family presence during resuscitation,"Recent studies of healthcare provider attitudes toward the presence of family members during CPR and invasive procedures (family presence) have focused on retrospective or cross-sectional surveys of staff. Research shows that clinicians' opinions on the value of this practice are mixed. Although guidelines for implementing family presence have been proposed, few reports describing actual programs or effective strategies for changing the practice have been published. As staff committed to implementing a family attendance program in our own emergency department, we were interested in evaluating staff attitudes before and after the family attendance program was implemented. We also wanted to see if attitudes differ between nurses and doctors. In this article, we report our experience implementing a family attendance program in the emergency department of a large academic teaching hospital.",0,1,
952,Impact of a quality improvement program on the care and outcomes of children with asthma.,"Objective To test a quality improvement intervention, collaborative learning based on the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series methodology, specifically designed to improve care and outcomes for patients with childhood asthma. Design Randomized study in primary care practices. Practices in Greater Boston, Massachusetts and Greater Detroit, Mich. Participants Forty-three practices with 13,878 pediatric patients with asthma randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Intervention Participation in a collaborative learning project based on the Breakthrough Series methodology for continuous quality improvement. Main outcome measure Change from baseline in the proportion of children with persistent asthma who received appropriate asthma medication and the proportion of children whose parents received a written treatment plan for their child's asthma, as determined by telephone interviews with parents by 631 children. Results After adjustment for federal state, practice size, child's age, sex and clustering within the practice, no overall effect of the intervention was found. Conclusions This methodologically rigorous review of a widely used quality improvement technique showed no significant impact on processes or outcomes in the care of children with asthma. Possible shortcomings in program implementation, project duration, sample selection and data sources preclude the general conclusion that this type of improvement program is ineffective. More rigorous studies should be conducted under more optimal conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of this method for improving care.",0,1,
953,Impact of a web-based antimicrobial licensing system on the use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins in a teaching hospital.,"Aim: To achieve a sustainable improvement in the use of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (CEFX) in a large teaching hospital, measured against national antimicrobial guidelines. DESIGN AND SETTING: Pre- and post-intervention survey on CEFX use at Royal Melbourne Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria. Intervention: Web-based antimicrobial registration system in conjunction with national antimicrobial policies was developed by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in March 2001, 8 months before and 15 months after the intervention"";"" Compliance of the indication for CEFX with the national antimicrobial guidelines before and after the intervention. Results: CEFX use decreased from a mean of 38.3 DDDs/1000 bed-days before the intervention to 15.9, 18.7, and 21.2 DDDs/1000 bed-days at 1, 4, and 15 months after the intervention. Compliance with national antimicrobial guidelines increased from 25% of courses before intervention to 51% within 5 months after intervention (p<0.002). Gentamicin use also increased from a mean of 30.0 to 48.3 DDDs/1000 bed days (p=0.0001). Conclusion: The web-based antimicrobial approval system resulted in a sustained reduction in CEFX use over 15 months and increased prescription compliance with antimicrobial guidelines. It has potential for linking to e-prescribing and for wider use for other medicines, as well as for research into the epidemiology of antibiotic use.",0,1,
954,Impact of an educational effort to improve prescribing by private physicians in Uganda,"INTRODUCTION: Private urban practitioners in Uganda treat a large percentage of the most common adult medical conditions. Improving their prescribing would not only encourage more rational drug use, but would also reduce costs for patients. Interventions to improve drug use are generally more successful when face-to-face methods are incorporated. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of a personal training intervention for the treatment of acute respiratory infections (ARI), malaria and non-dysenteric diarrhea by private physicians in three urban areas of Uganda. METHODS: The study used an intervention with a comparison group design to evaluate the effect of the educational intervention. A total of 108 resident physicians were divided into intervention (n = 30) and control groups (n = 78). Surrogate patients trained to simulate the symptoms and signs of the target conditions were used to collect data on physicians' medical practices and prescribing behavior. Intervention physicians were invited to a one-day interactive training seminar moderated by local thought leaders on the principles of rational drug use and national standard treatment guidelines for treating the target disorders. Data on basic practices were also made available to physicians. RESULTS: Baseline data showed high rates of inappropriate treatment practices in both the intervention and control groups. There was near-universal use of antibiotics for ARI (over 90%), high rates of injections recommended for malaria (over 30%), and high rates of polypharmacy (more than three drugs per patient). After the intervention, some significant improvements in key practices were observed in the intervention group. Compared to control physicians, antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs in the intervention group decreased by 23%, use of combination products for malaria decreased by 28%, there were trends towards better adherence to guidelines for ARIs and malaria, and modest reductions in drug costs . However, the overall impact of the intervention was limited, particularly in terms of quality indicators related to history taking, appropriate assessment, and patient counseling. CONCLUSION: The face-to-face educational intervention resulted in some small improvements in key private practitioner prescribing practices. However, achieving greater improvements would require an intervention that involves repeated contacts with prescribing physicians and takes economic considerations into account. Private practitioners need to be made aware and encouraged to use the national standard of care guidelines, and attempts to improve their prescribing should be supported by community education.",0,0,
955,Impact of clinical practice guidelines on clinician behavior: tonsillectomy in children,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess to what extent the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines for listing children for tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) affected the behavior of the participating ENT surgeons. METHOD: A before-and-after study in which the intervention (the development and dissemination of local practice guidelines) was sequentially implemented in different hospitals and surgical practices. The study was conducted in four ENT surgeons in Northern England with 16 consultant ENT surgeons and their offspring on 1190 children aged 0-14 who were assessed prior to consultation with an ENT surgeon who were referred for throat problems for which tonsillectomy was a possible treatment option were included in the study. Surgeons' decision and proportion of decisions that conformed to the new guidelines. RESULTS: Of the clinical decisions to admit children for tonsillectomy made before the introduction of locally agreed guidelines, 73% (486/660) met the criteria of the subsequent guidelines, 15% (97/660) did not, and 12% (77/ 660), it was impossible to judge. After the intervention, the corresponding numbers were 73% (386/530), 14% (73/53), and 13% (71/530), respectively. When decisions were made to violate guidelines, this was more likely to include tonsillectomy when not indicated - 83% (141/170) - than to refuse tonsillectomy when indicated - 17% (29/ 170) . Aspects of the guidelines that were violated in decisions to perform tonsillectomy were: the child's age was younger than the recommended guidelines - 54% (75/141)”; there were febrile attacks of tonsillitis than the recommended guidelines - 22% (32/141);"" and there were ""significant"" symptoms not included in the guidelines - 20% (29/141). CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong evidence for that On the contrary, local guidelines were formulated at a level that the majority of surgeons have already achieved. Guideline development and implementation therefore had very little impact on clinical practice. The process of local guideline formulation was not sufficient to drive a change towards to achieve evidence-based practice""; ""The clinical preference proved to be quite persistent. There is a need to improve the skills of clinicians in evaluating and interpreting research results. Previous work has emphasized the need to examine factors affecting the clinical Influencing behavior towards evidence-based practice Our study suggests that More research is needed into why clinicians continue to follow clinical preferences, even when asked to base agreed local clinical guidelines on evidence.",0,0,
956,"Impact of Clinical Trial Results on National Trends in O-Blocker Prescribing, 1996-2002","Context Research on factors influencing prescribing patterns and magnitude of changes induced by clinical trial results is limited. Aim To examine the changes in the prescribing of beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension before and after the publication of the April 2000 adverse early termination of the Treatment of Hypertension and Lipid Lowering for the Prevention of Heart Attack (ALLHAT) study involving the doxazosin mesylate arm of the study. Prescribing changes were considered in the context of other potential concurrent influences on drug use between 1996 and 2002, including price changes in A-blocker drugs, switching to generics, drug advertising, and competition. Design, setting and patients Using 2 national pharmaceutical market research reports published by IMS HEALTH, a-blocker prescription orders reported in the National Prescription Audit - a random computerized sample of approximately 20,000 out of 29,000 retail, independent and mail-order pharmacies and bulk and discount retailers - and A-blocker prescription patterns by physicians in private practice reported in the National Disease and Therapeutic Index - a randomly stratified sample of approximately 3500 physician offices. Outcome Measurement Trends in physician-reported A-blocker use and in U.S. pharmacy prescribing and dispensing of A-blockers. Results From 1996 to 1999, there was a steady increase in new alpha-blocker prescriptions, prescriptions dispensed, and physician consumption of drugs. After the early demise of ALLHAT and subsequent releases in early 2000, there was a slight reversal in these trends. Between 1999 and 2002 new annual a-blocker prescription orders fell 26% (from 5.15 million to 3.79 million), prescriptions filled fell 22% (from 17.2 million to 13.4 million) and that from physicians reported drug use by 54% (from 2.26 million to 1.03 million). Other potential influences do not appear to have contributed significantly to this decline, although the cessation of marketing A-blockers may have accelerated the decline. Conclusions Moderate but statistically significant decreases in the use of doxazosin and other beta-blockers coincided with early termination of the ALLHAT doxazosin arm. Although physicians responded to these new findings, strategies to amplify the impact of clinical trials on clinical practice are warranted.",0,0,
957,Effects of computer-based decision support on blood pressure management and control: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of computer-assisted decision support (CDS) designed to improve hypertensive care and outcomes in a racially diverse sample of primary care patients. METHODS We randomized 2,027 adult patients receiving hypertensive treatment in 14 primary care practices either for 18 months from their physicians, who received CDS for each hypertensive patient, or to usual care without computer assistance for the control group. We assessed the prescription of guideline-recommended drug therapy and the extent of blood pressure control for patients in each group, and examined whether the effects of the intervention differed according to the race/ethnicity of the patients using interaction terms. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Blood pressure control rates were 42% at baseline and 46% at outcome visit, with no significant differences between groups. After adjusting for patient demographics and clinical characteristics, number of previous visits, and level of baseline blood pressure control, there were no differences between the intervention groups in the likelihood of blood pressure control success. Provider use of CDS significantly improved Joint National Committee (JNC) guideline-compliant prescribing of medications compared to usual care (7% vs. 5%, P?OR] 1.39 [CI, 1.13-1 ,72]) and the effects of the intervention did not differ according to the race and ethnicity of the patients. CONCLUSIONS CDS improved the prescription of appropriate medications without improving differences in care and overall blood pressure control. Future Work is needed that focuses on improving these interventions and examining other practical interventions to reduce disparities in hypertension-related outcomes.",1,1,
958,Influence of decision support in electronic health records on lipid management in primary care.,"Electronic decision support tools can help improve the management of hyperlipidemia and other chronic diseases. This study examined the effects of lipid management tools integrated into an electronic medical record (EMR) in general practitioner offices. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of physicians using outpatient EMR. Adult primary care physicians were randomized from practice to receive an electronic form embedded in the EMR. The form included suboptimal care prompts based on Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) guidelines and reporting tools to identify off-office patients whose lipid management was suboptimal. All active patients aged 20 to 79 years whose physicians participated in the study were classified as high, moderate, or low cardiovascular risk, and the proportion tested for hyperlipidemia, at lipid target, and on lipid-lowering drugs when off-target were measured according to ATP III guidelines. A total of 105 physicians from 25 practices and 64,150 patients were included in the study. Outcomes improved for most measures from before to 1 year after the intervention (November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006). However, after controlling for confounding variables and clustering in multilevel modeling, only the current lipid determination for high-risk patients in the intervention group was statistically better than in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 15.0, P?<?0.05). This study showed few differences in the quality of lipid management after implementing an EMR-based disease management intervention in primary care. Future studies may need to explore broader interventions that involve office staff in a team approach to care. (Population Health Management 2009"";""12:221-226)",1,1,
959,Effects of EHR-based clinical decision support on compliance for patients using NSAIDs: a randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Electronic health records (EHRs) with clinical decision support promise to improve quality of care, but their impact on chronic disease management has been mixed. This study evaluated the impact of EHR-based clinical decision support on adherence to guidelines to reduce gastrointestinal complications in primary care patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted in a national network of primary care practices using an EHR and focused on patients taking traditional NSAIDs and having factors associated with a high risk of gastrointestinal complications (a history of peptic ulcer disease); concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents [including aspirin], or corticosteroids, or an age of 75 years or older) Offices were randomized to receive EHR-based guidelines and warnings for high-risk patients on NSAIDs or usual care was the proportion of patients who during the RESULTS: Participants included 27 practices with 119 physicians and 5,234 high-risk patients. Intervention patients were more likely than standard care patients to receive guideline-compliant care (25.4% vs. 22.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.42). In some high-risk groups, patients taking low-dose aspirin were more likely to receive guideline-compliant care compared to usual care (25.0% vs. 20.8%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1, 62 ), but there was no significant difference for patients in other high-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated only a small impact of EHR-based clinical decision support for high-risk patients on NSAIDs in primary care settings. These results add to the growing literature on the complexity of EHR-based clinical decision support to improve the quality of care.",0,0,

A total of 165 participants studied a standardized patient, with one sample exposed to fresh scent (N=79) and the other exposed to the standard environment (N=86). Hand hygiene behavior was tracked prior to patient contact using video surveillance. The standard environment group had a 51% HHC rate, while participants in the fresh scent group had a higher 80% HHC rate (P<0.001).

961,Impact of environmental patient education on preventive medical practices,"BACKGROUND: Studies show that provider-focused reminders alone are less effective in increasing physician adherence to prevention guidelines than combinations of patient- and provider-focused physician reminders. The effectiveness of environmental patient education (ie practice-based videos, booklets and posters) without the involvement of individual staff or educators is not well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental patient education in increasing the amount of preventive services patients receive. METHODS: A non-randomized controlled trial with historical controls was conducted in a model primary care practice at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque. The study group (n = 389) included adult women who were seen in the clinic at a time when educational materials were available in the waiting area. The control group (n = 381) consisted of similarly selected patients treated in the same period of the previous year when such materials were not available. During the procedure, patients in the waiting area were exposed to educational materials encouraging them to ask their doctors about cholesterol tests, Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, tetanus boosters, and mammograms. For both the control and study groups, physician orders for preventive services were monitored over a 4-month follow-up period by reviewing medical records. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes in the number of cholesterol tests, Pap smears, tetanus boosters, or mammograms ordered after the environmental patient education intervention, despite reasonable statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental patient education materials were not effective in increasing the number of preventive services performed by physicians in this study. Although such interventions are inexpensive, easily understood, and well-intentioned, they may be ineffective in increasing the performance of patient prevention services.",0,0,
962,Influence of feedback and didactic sessions on the reporting behavior of upper endoscopic findings by physicians and nurses,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines for reporting Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia measurements and reflux esophagitis grades were developed to improve consistency, communication, and ultimately patient care. Our objectives were to assess the percentage of cases where findings were reported in accordance with the guidelines and to assess the impact of education and feedback on reporting behavior. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study design was used. Chart reviews were performed for all adult patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy at a tertiary care center during three 2-month periods during a 12-month interval: Timepoint 1 (March 1, 2004 – March 30, 2004 – August 31, 2004) and Time 3 (March 1, 2005-April 30, 2005). Standardized educational sessions started 2 years before time point 1. No intervention took place between time point 1 and time point 2"";"" Data was collected to examine secular change. Between Time 2 and Time 3, individual and group feedback and refresher sessions were given. RESULTS: Five thousand six hundred and nine appropriate esophagogastroduodenoscopies were performed, of which 2675 demonstrated Barrett's esophagus, hiatal hernia, and/or reflux esophagitis. At baseline, Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia measurements were correctly dictated in a median of 67% and 86% of cases, respectively, which translates to 100% (p<0.05) and 98% (p<0.01) of cases improved. The Los Angeles classification system was used in a median of 100% of cases at baseline and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anonymous individual and group feedback combined with short, structured didactic training sessions significantly improves adherence to established guidelines for reporting Barrett's esophagus and hiatal hernia. Once successfully introduced into clinical practice, compliance with the Esophagitis Los Angeles Classification System is easy to maintain.",0,1,
963,Influence of information leaflets on the behavior of patients with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis: a randomized cluster study in French primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of four patient information leaflets on patient behavior in primary care. DESIGN: Cluster randomized multicenter controlled trial between November 2009 and January 2011. PARTICIPANTS: French adults and children who consulted a participating primary care physician and were diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis. Patients were randomized to receive package inserts or not, according to their primary care physician's cluster randomization. INTERVENTION: Adult patients or adults accompanying a child diagnosed with gastroenteritis or tonsillitis were informed about the study. The doctors of the intervention group gave the patients an information leaflet about their condition. Two weeks after the consultation, the patients (or their companion) answered a telephone questionnaire about their behavior and knowledge about the disease. MAIN MEASURES: The main and sub-outcomes, mean behavioral and knowledge scores, respectively, were calculated from the responses to this questionnaire. RESULTS: 24 physicians enrolled 400 patients. Twelve patients were lost to follow-up (3%). In the group receiving the leaflet, patient behavior was closer to guideline recommendations than in the control group (mean behavior score 4.9 versus 4.2, p<0.01). The knowledge of the adults who received the leaflet was better than that of the control group (mean knowledge value 4.2 versus 3.6, p<0.01). There were fewer visits for the same symptoms by household members of patients given brochures (23.4% vs. 56.2%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Patient information leaflets distributed by the physician during the consultation significantly alter the patient's behavior and knowledge about the disease compared to patients who do not receive the leaflets for the disorders studied.",0,0,

Antibiotics were prescribed to 40% (35,505/89,719) of patients with a positive malaria test result and 69% (39,400) of patients /57â‚¬â€°080) of those with a negative result. All but one study showed a trend towards more antibiotic prescriptions in groups undergoing rapid diagnostic tests. Meta-analysis of random effects of the studies showed that the overall risk of antibiotic prescription in interventional settings was 21% higher (95% confidence interval 7% to 36%). In most intervention settings, patients with negative test results received more antibiotic prescriptions than patients with positive results for all of the most commonly used classes: penicillins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one exception), tetracyclines, and metronidazole. Conclusions: Introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria to reduce the unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs - a positive public health outcome - could drive the indiscriminate use of antibiotics. That 69% of patients were prescribed antibiotics despite testing negative is likely to represent overprescribing. This included antibiotics from multiple classes, including those such as metronidazole, which are rarely appropriate for febrile illness, in diverse clinical, healthcare system, and epidemiological settings . It is often assumed that better disease-specific diagnostics will reduce antimicrobial overuse, but they may simply shift it from one antimicrobial class to another. The current global rollout of malaria testing could increase the indiscriminate use of antibiotics and needs to be reviewed.",0,1,
965,Impact of Mediterranean diet education versus published booklets on dietary habits and serum cholesterol in a high-risk population for cardiovascular disease,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of intensive group training on the Mediterranean diet on food intake and serum total cholesterol at 16 and 52 weeks in comparison to a posted brochure with the Dutch dietary guidelines in the context of primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). DESIGN: Controlled comparative study of an intervention group with intensive group training about the Mediterranean diet and a control group of people with hypercholesterolemia under usual care by general practitioners (GPs). SETTING: A socioeconomically disadvantaged area in the Netherlands with an increased mortality rate from coronary heart disease (CHD). PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty-six hypercholesterolemic subjects with at least two other CVD risk factors. RESULTS: At 52 weeks, the intervention group decreased total fat and saturated fat intake more than the control group (net differences were 1.8 en% (95% CI 0.2-3.4) and 1.1 en% (95% CI 0.4–1.9) respectively). According to the Mediterranean dietary guidelines, consumption of fish, fruit, poultry and bread increased more in the intervention group than in the control group. Within the intervention group, the consumption of fish (+100%), poultry (+28%) and bread (+6%) was significantly increased after 1 year (P<0.05). The intensive nutrition education program did not reduce serum cholesterol significantly more (-3%) than the package insert (-2%) (net difference 0.06 mmol l-1, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.22). Initially, the body mass index (BMI) decreased more in the intervention group, but after 1 year both the intervention and control groups increased equally (+1%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite positive changes in dietary habits in the intervention group compared to the control group, BMI increased at 1 year and total fat and saturated fat intake was still excessive.",0,0,
966,Impact of alarms on uninterrupted medication monitoring in ambulatory care.,"Objective: Disruptive alarms in electronic applications can cause “alarm fatigue” if they are triggered too frequently or are only sometimes clinically useful. We evaluated the impact of uninterrupted, real-time medication lab alerts on vendor lab test ordering. DESIGN: We included 22 outpatient practices in a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Clinics either used the existing system or received on-screen recommendations for basic laboratory tests when prescribing new drugs. Because the alerts were non-disruptive, providers did not have to respond to the notification or acknowledge the notification to complete a medication request. Measurements: Data was collected each time providers performed proposed laboratory tests within 14 days of a new prescription order. The results were adjusted for patient and service provider characteristics as well as patient clusters within hospitals. RESULTS: Among 12 clinics with 191 providers in the control group and 10 clinics with 175 providers in the intervention group, there were a total of 3673 events for which basic laboratory testing would have been recommended: 1988 events in the control group and 1685 in the intervention group. In the control group, source laboratories were requested for 771 (39%) of the drugs. In the intervention group, baseline labs were ordered by clinicians in 689 (41%) cases. Overall, there was no significant association between the intervention and the rate of ordering appropriate baseline laboratory tests. Conclusion: We found that non-interruptive drug laboratory monitoring alerts were not effective in improving compliance with recommended baseline monitoring of drug laboratory tests. More work is needed to improve compliance with non-critical recommendations.",1,1,
967,Effects of dual pharmacist-physician intervention on prescribed benzodiazepines in prisoners: a retrospective study,"High-dose benzodiazepines (BDZs) represent an important risk factor for addiction, particularly in the prison setting. In Lyon prison, patients with mental disorders are often prescribed BDZs and/or maintenance opioids. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of psychiatrist-pharmacist collaboration on reducing the dose of BDZ prescribed to prison patients. Since 2001, clinicians and pharmacists have held monthly meetings to develop prescribing guidelines and discuss patients receiving high-dose BDZ. All psychotropic drugs prescribed were noted for each enrolled patient in the control (before guidelines) and intervention groups. The criteria used to define each patient profile included age, diagnosis (mental disorder), and concomitant treatment (opioids, antidepressants). To compare each group, the daily dose of the prescribed BDZs was used as a quantitative variable and expressed in diazepam equivalents. Four hundred and seventy-three patients were included, 222 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. The two groups showed no difference in terms of diagnosis. The daily dose of BDZ was higher in the control group when all patients were considered (mean (CONTROL GROUP) = 46 mg in diazepam equivalent vs. mean (INTERVENTION GROUP) = 34 mg) and for each of the following patient categories: ""mental disorder"" (48 mg vs. 30 mg), ""no treatment with opioids"" (44 mg vs. 31 mg), ""treatment with buprenorphine"" (58 mg vs. 63 mg), ""no treatment with antidepressants"" (41 mg vs. 29 mg) and “antidepressant treatment” (53 mg vs. 38 mg). The results of this retrospective study demonstrate the beneficial effects of a multidisciplinary intervention in reducing the daily dose of BDZs prescribed. This experience confirms the positive impact that pharmacist feedback on prescribing and the development of treatment guidelines through collaboration between clinicians and pharmacists has on improving prescribing practice in a prison setting.",0,0,
968,Effects of asthma care physician education on patient outcomes,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of a continuing medical education program, Physician Asthma Care Education, in improving the asthma therapeutic and communication skills of pediatricians and the utilization of medical care by asthma patients. METHODS: We conducted a randomized study in 10 regions in the United States. Primary providers were recruited and randomly assigned by location to receive the program provided by local faculty. The program included two interactive seminar sessions (2.5 hours each) that reviewed national asthma guidelines, communication skills and key educational messages. The format included short lectures, case discussions and a video on modeling communication techniques. We collected information about parents' perceptions of doctor communication, the child's asthma symptoms, and patients' utilization of asthma health care. We used multivariate regression models to determine differences between control and intervention groups. RESULTS: A total of 101 general practitioners and a random sample of 870 of their asthma patients participated. After 1 year, we conducted telephone follow-up interviews with the parents of 731 of the 870 patients. Compared to controls, parents reported that physicians in the intervention group were more likely to inquire about patients' concerns about asthma, encourage patients to be physically active, and set goals for successful treatment. Patients from physicians who participated in the program had greater reductions in asthma symptom-limited days (8.5 vs. 15.6 days) as well as fewer asthma emergency room visits (0.30 vs. 0.55 visits per year ). CONCLUSIONS: The asthma care physician training program was used in a number of locations and was effective in improving the communication skills of parent-reported providers, the number of days affected by asthma symptoms, and asthma health care utilization. Patients with more frequent asthma symptoms and higher health care utilization at baseline were more likely to benefit from their physician's participation in the program.",0,0,
969,Effects of regular collaboration between infectious disease and critical care physicians on antimicrobial use and patient outcome,"AIM: Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been shown to help reduce the use of unnecessary antimicrobials in hospital settings. So far, there is very little data that focuses on high-traffic areas such as the medical intensive care unit. A prospective intervention was conducted to assess guideline adherence, antimicrobial spending, and healthcare costs when an infectious disease worker regularly interacts with the ICU medical team. DESIGN: A 3-month retrospective chart review was followed by a 3-month prospective intervention the following year. A total of 246 charts were reviewed to assess generally accepted compliance, demographics, and microbiological results. SETTING: 24-bed medical intensive care unit at an 861-bed tertiary care teaching hospital in North Carolina. SUBJECTS: Patients receiving antibiotics in the medical intensive care unit. INTERVENTION: During the intervention period, the infectious disease colleague reviewed the spreadsheets, including physician notes and microbiological data, and discussed antimicrobial use with the ICU medical team. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Antimicrobial use, duration of treatment, acute physiology and chronic health assessment II scores, length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates were compared during the two periods. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found in the two groups at baseline (ie, age, gender, race, or acute physiology and chronic health assessment II scores). Indications for antibiotics included hospital-acquired (53%) and community-acquired pneumonia (17%). Significant reductions were observed in extended-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0080), carbapenems (p=0.0013), vancomycin (p=0.0040), and metronidazole (p=0.0004) after the intervention. Antimicrobial modification resulted in an increase in narrow-spectrum penicillins (p=0.0322). The intervention group had a significantly lower rate of non-guideline-compliant treatments (p < 0.0001). There was a reduction in days on ventilation (p=0.0053), length of stay (p=0.0188), and in-hospital mortality (p=0.0367). The annual calculated healthcare savings were $89,944 just from stopping antibiotics early. CONCLUSION: Active communication with an infectious disease physician can significantly reduce antibiotic overuse in the ICU through earlier modification or cessation of antibiotics without increasing mortality. This, in turn, can reduce healthcare costs, promote excellence in education, and strengthen subspecialty relationships.",0,0,
970,Impact of the WHO depression guideline on patient care by psychiatrists: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Scientific literature reviews aim to summarize the state of knowledge and published empirical evidence. In contrast, medical guidelines are intervention tools aimed at improving physician behavior and patient outcome. They can have positive as well as negative effects. Their effectiveness needs to be verified through research. Methods: In a randomized controlled study, 103 psychiatrists in private practice were either only provided with the WHO guidelines for depression (information group) or provided with the WHO guidelines for depression and trained in these guidelines for one day (intervention group) or left uninformed (control group). They then treated a total of 497 patients based on individual clinical considerations and patient needs. Observation of routine treatment lasted 12 weeks. Physicians and patients documented the course of the disease and treatment, including the doctor-patient interaction. RESULTS: Psychiatrists in the intervention group saw more psychosocial stressors in their patients, prescribed higher doses of medication, had fewer dropouts, and rated treatment outcome as better. Ratings of patient-physician interactions revealed greater strain in their relationships. CONCLUSIONS: The results show both positive and negative effects of guideline exposure, but only in the training group and not in the information group. Guidelines should be empirically tested before they are labeled “evidence-based”. Each policy should also set out how it can or must be implemented in order to be effective.",0,0,
971,Impaired self-esteem after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury,Patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience self-esteem issues several months or years after the injury. Patients may underestimate cognitive and behavioral difficulties that are the true remnants of their brain injury. Research increasingly indicates that the remnants of these disorders of consciousness strongly influence the course and outcome of rehabilitation. A current model for conceptualizing disturbances in self-awareness after different forms of brain injury is reviewed.,0,0,
972,Implementation and roll-out of nationwide electronic health records in secondary care in England: Final qualitative results of a prospective national assessment in early adopter hospitals,"OBJECTIVES To assess the implementation and roll-out of the NHS Detailed Care Records service in early adopter hospitals in England. DESIGN Theoretically sound, qualitative longitudinal assessment based on case studies. SETTING 12 early adopter NHS acute hospitals and specialist care facilities studied over two and a half years. DATA SOURCES Data was collected through in-depth interviews, observations and relevant documents that directly related to case study sites and broader national developments that were believed to impact the implementation strategy. The data were analyzed thematically, first within and then across cases. The dataset consisted of 431 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders including hospital staff, developers and government officials, 590 hours of observing strategic meetings and use of the software in context, 334 notes from observations, field notes from researchers and notes from national conferences, 809 NHS documents and 58 regional and national documents RESULTS Implementation was slower, with a narrower scope and much less clinical functionality than originally planned The national strategy had a significant local impact (grouped under five main themes) of care and end-user needs for training and support . Other factors hampering progress have been the changing milieu of NHS policy and priorities, constantly renegotiated national contracts, the varying stages of development of different NHS care record service systems; ' and a complex process of communication between different stakeholders, together with contractual arrangements that largely excluded NHS providers. There was early evidence that the use of systems led to important learning within and between organizations and the development of relevant skills within NHS hospitals. CONCLUSIONS Implementing the NHS Care Records Service in early adopter locations proved time consuming and challenging , with as yet limited discernible benefits for clinicians and no clear benefits for patients. Although our results may not be directly transferrable, as the functionalities we evaluated were new and untried in the English context, they shed light on the processes involved with implementation of new systems and sheds light on the processes involved in the implementation of important new systems is welcomed by the NHS, but it is important that the policy does not lose sight of the overall objective of an integrated interoperable solution.",0,0,
973,Implementation and success of nurse telephone counseling in linguistically isolated Korean-American patients with hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: Telephone counseling by nurses can improve management of chronic illness, but the effectiveness of this approach in underserved populations is unclear. This study evaluated the use of bilingual telephone counseling by nurses among Korean-Americans (KAs) participating in a community-based intervention study to improve hypertension management. METHODS: KAs were randomized to receive more intensive (biweekly) or less intensive (monthly) hypertension telephone consultations for 12 months. Counseling protocols were maintained for 360 PRs who completed the pre- and post-intervention evaluations. RESULTS: The overall success rate for the intervention was 80.3%. The level of success was significantly influenced by the dose of counseling, employment status, and years of US residency. Over the 12-month counseling period, both groups showed improvements in medication intake, alcohol consumption, and exercise, but no smoking, with no significant group differences. CONCLUSION: Bilingual telephone counseling could reach monolingual KAs and improve their behavior in dealing with hypertension. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Bilingual telephone nursing advice can have broad applicability and serve as an effective means of disseminating evidence-based guidance on managing chronic illness in a linguistically isolated community with limited health resources and information.",0,0,
974,Trajectories to implementation fidelity of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings: managing tension in rehabilitation care,"Background Although the importance of assessing implementation fidelity is recognized, little is known about the heterogeneity of fidelity over time. The aim of this study is to gain insights into the heterogeneity of trajectories of compliance of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and the relationship to changes in patient health behaviors. Methods This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-based physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Loyalty scores were calculated based on annual surveys completed by participating professionals (n?=?Â¡Ã€?70). Higher precision values indicate a more complete implementation of the program's core components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the implementation fidelity scores of 17 organizations at three different time points. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to examine organizational and professional differences between the identified careers. Regression analyzes were performed to determine differences in patient outcomes. Results Three trajectories were identified as follows: ""Stable High Fidelity"" (n?=?9), ""Moderate and Improving Fidelity"" (n?=?6), and "" unstable fidelity (n?=?2). The stable, high-fidelity organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and improving fidelity organizations. At the beginning and end of the implementation phase, physician and physical therapist support, professional esteem, and program compatibility were rated more positively by professionals working in stable, high-fidelity organizations than in organizations with moderate and improving fidelity (S ?< ?.05). Qualitative data showed that the stable, high-fidelity organizations often had a clear vision and strategy for program implementation. Interestingly, the trajectories were not associated with the patients' self-reported physical activity scores (fitted model Â¦Ã‚?=???651.6, t(613)?=???1032, p?=?.303) . Conclusions Differences in the trajectories of implementation fidelity at the organizational level did not lead to differences in outcomes at the patient level. This suggests that effective implementation fidelity depends on local organization conditions. More specifically, achieving stable and high implementation fidelity required managing tensions: realizing a localized vision for change while protecting the standardized core components of the program and involving the scarce physicians throughout the process. In expanding evidence-based health promotion programs, we propose to adapt the management of implementation tensions to the starting position, size, and circumstances of local organizations.",0,1,
975,The implementation of a new guideline leads to a decrease in pressure ulcer incidence,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of a new guideline on the efficiency of pressure ulcer treatment. DESIGN: Series of one-day pre- and post-implementation pressure ulcer surveys. SETTING: A 900-bed university hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: On the survey days, 657 patients were enrolled before implementation, 735 patients 4 months after implementation, and 755 patients 11 months after implementation. INTERVENTION: Implementation of a hospital guideline for decubitus care combined with the introduction of viscoelastic foam mattresses for the efficiency of the prevention and treatment of decubitus. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparisons were made before and after implementation regarding nursing behaviors of nurses and frequency of pressure ulcer patients. RESULTS: Inadequate prevention decreased from 19 to 4% at 4 months and 6% at 11 months (p<0.001), and inadequate treatment decreased from 60 to 31% (p=0.005). Apart from the use of mattresses as a positive indicator of nursing behavior, we found no significant increase in adequate nursing care for pressure ulcer prevention. Even with adequate treatment activities, we found no significant difference. Overall, we found a significant decrease in the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers from 18 to 13% (p=0.003) at 4 months and 11% (p<0.001) at 11 months. CONCLUSION: The number of pressure ulcer patients in the hospital can be successfully reduced. General measures such as the introduction of adequate mattresses and guidelines for prevention and treatment are promising tools in this regard.",0,1,
976,Implementing an Effective Intervention for High-Risk Women in Mexico: Protocol for a Multisite Randomized Trial with a Parallel Study on Organizational Factors,"Background Studies on the implementation of effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention interventions are rare, particularly in resource-constrained settings, but are important because they have the potential to increase the impact of interventions by improving acceptability and sustainability. Few studies have focused on provider and organizational factors that may affect uptake and adherence to core intervention components. Using a hybrid design, we will examine the implementation of an effective intervention to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female sex workers (FSWs) in 12 cities across Mexico. Our protocol will test a ¡Â®train-the-trainer¡¯ implementation model to transport Mujer Segura (Healthy Woman) intervention to community-based organizations (CBOs). Methods We partnered with the Mexican Foundation for Family Planning (Mexfam), an NGO that has CBOs across Mexico. At each CBO, trained ethnographers interview CBO staff about characteristics of their organization and their attitudes towards their CBO and implementation of Evidence-Based Interventions (EBIs). After CBO staff recruits a sample of 80 eligible FSWs and 40 women randomly selected from this pool perform standard didactic treatment, a Mexfam staff member is trained in Mujer Segura's intervention and then trains other counselors on the Perform Mujer Segura to the remaining 40 participating FSWs. FSW participants receive a baseline behavioral assessment and are tested for HIV and STDs (syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia)."";"" They will be reassessed six months after the intervention to measure possible intervention effects. At the same time, both qualitative and quantitative data on the implementation process will be collected, including measures on the advisors' loyalty to the intervention model. After data collection is completed at each CBO, the relative effectiveness of the Mujer Segura intervention will be analyzed and, across CBOs, correlations between individual and organizational provider characteristics and intervention effectiveness will be examined. Discussion This collaborative, binational research study will provide important insights into barriers and facilitating factors associated with implementing interventions in CBOs using the ¡Â®train-the-trainer¡Â¯ model. Our work builds on similar scale-up strategies that have been successful in the United States. This study has the potential to advance our knowledge of the generalizability of such strategies across health issues, national contexts, and organizational contexts.",0,0,
977,"Implementation of clinical guidelines through an electronic medical record: physician use, satisfaction and assessment","CONTEXT: We developed and evaluated the Emergency Department Expert Charting System (EDECS) to provide real-time guidance on the management of low back pain in adults, fever in children, and occupational exposure to blood and body fluids in healthcare workers by embedding clinical guidelines within an electronic patient record. OBJECTIVE: To describe the behaviors and attitudes of physicians who have used EDECS. DESIGN: Pre-post questionnaires were used to assess physicians' attitudes. Intervention phase time studies were observational studies using clocks embedded in the software. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty-two residents and residents in emergency, pediatric, internal and family medicine and patients with the above conditions. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician's use of EDECS, time spent with EDECS, physician satisfaction, and beliefs. RESULTS: 84% of the 142 licensed physicians used EDECS at least once. 591 of 789 (75%) eligible cases were closed with EDECS. Mean session time decreased from 12 minutes for session 1 to 5.5 minutes for sessions 16 and above. Physicians generally agreed that EDECS care was better than standard care, particularly with regard to documentation. There was, however, considerable heterogeneity in belief among the complaints. CONCLUSIONS: These data shed light on both the potential of computer-assisted decision-making and the need for context-specific approaches when trying to implement policy.",0,1,
978,Implementation of clinical practice guidelines for the prevention of thromboembolism in spinal cord injury.,"Background/aims: The aim of this study was to determine whether the publication of the clinical practice guideline (CPG) ""Prevention of thromboembolism in spinal cord injury"" has changed patient management and whether adherence to the CPG recommendations has improved following a targeted implementation strategy. METHODS: Data were collected from medical records of 134 and 520 patients with acute and chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), respectively, from 6 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers over 3 time periods: pre-release (T1), pre-implementation (T2), and post-implementation (T3) of the CPG. Targeted interventions were designed to address provider-perceived barriers to compliance based on the outcomes of the focus groups conducted at each site. The interventions included two implementation strategies: standardized documentation templates/standing orders and social marketing/outreach visits. Results: The use of the indicated duration for pharmacological prophylaxis increased from 60% to 65% to 75% of patients with acute SCI at T1, T2 and T3, respectively (p = 0.060 and 0.041 for T1 vs. T2 and T2 vs. T3, respectively) . ). Usage rates for individual prophylactic pharmacological agents changed significantly over the course of the study, with use of low molecular weight heparin increasing from 7% in T1 to 42% in T3. Physical examinations for thrombosis on hospital days 1 and 30 improved between T2 and T3. Use of prophylaxis in chronically injured patients with new risk factors for thromboembolism increased from 16% to 31% to 34% during T1, T2, and T3 (p=0.001 and 0.87, respectively). Conclusions: The publication of the guideline had only a modest impact on practice. The use of a structured implementation further increased compliance with some CPG recommendations for thromboembolism prophylaxis. Similar implementation strategies should be considered for CPG recommendations with low adherence and high morbidity and mortality potential.",0,1,
979,Conducting Diagnosis in Asymptomatic Patients with Aortic Stenosis: Conducting Diagnosis in Asymptomatic Patients with Aortic Stenosis registry,"In clinical practice, some physicians often refer patients with aortic stenosis for an invasive approach in the asymptomatic phase of the disease. This empirical behavior, contrary to the recommendations of the current international clinical guidelines, is based on the perception that the prognosis of these patients is actually worse than assumed. Indeed, the treatment of asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis remains controversial and there is no clear consensus on how to reduce excessive clinical events associated with the presence of aortic stenosis mortality and morbidity demonstrated in recent randomized clinical trials in these patients. The prevailing attention of the attending physicians is often limited to assessing the severity of aortic stenosis and the occurrence of symptoms, but it has become clear that the prognosis of these patients is accompanied by excessive left ventricular mass growth and increased atherosclerosis, which leads to coronary artery disease, heart failure , stroke and death. Therefore, in addition to the markers of faster aortic stenosis progression, many other clinical and echocardiographic variables should be considered, collected and used together with the clinical/echocardiographic prognostic scores recently validated by several authors in clinical practice, where the vast majority of these variables reside culpably not considered. The registry for performing the diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is a prospective study with the aim of improving the diagnostic work-up and prognostic stratification of patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis.",0,0,
980,Implementation of evidence-based rehabilitation for non-specific back pain and frequent psychological problems: A process evaluation of a nationwide initiative,"BACKGROUND: The nationwide implementation of guaranteed access to evidence-based rehabilitation was introduced in Sweden in 2009 by a Swedish government law. The primary goal of the rehabilitation guarantee was to increase the reintegration rate, reduce and prevent long-term absences after diagnoses related to back pain and common mental health problems. The aim of this study is to develop knowledge about factors influencing the large-scale implementation of complex and large-scale healthcare interventions. METHODS: Three different data sources questionnaires, interviews and documents were used in data collection and analysis. The data were analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. RESULTS: The following main sponsors contributed to the realization of the Rehabilitation Guarantee: financial incentives, building a project organization, recruitment, in-service training and previous experience of working in similar projects. Obstacles were: the short-term project form of the rehabilitation guarantee, the attitude and competence of the clinicians when working on the return to work, the lack of guidelines describing treatment modalities in multimodal rehabilitation, and the lack of clearly defined criteria for patient admission. Documents showed that the goal of returning to work was less pronounced during the implementation process. Instead, care and health were more often described in documents used to disseminate information about the Rehabilitation Guarantee. As interim results, a more adequate priority of patients with rehabilitation needs, an increased willingness for future implementation efforts as well as an increased general competence in psychotherapy and teamwork were determined, which were thus also available to other patient groups than those covered by the rehabilitation guarantee. CONCLUSIONS: To facilitate the implementation of established national policy goals in clinical practice, tools specifically aimed at changing clinician attitudes and behaviors towards such goals are needed. Our results underline the importance of investing both time and sufficient resources in the activities and supporting the implementation process.",0,0,

982,Implementation of the Spanish adaptation of the European guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Successful implementation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention guidelines is highly dependent on primary care physicians (PCPs) providing risk factor assessment, intervention, and patient education. The aim of this study was to determine the level of awareness and the implementation of the Spanish adaptation of the European guidelines for CVD prevention in clinical practice (CEIPC guidelines) among general practitioners. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of primary care physicians was conducted in Spain between January and June 2011. A random sample of 1,390 general practitioners was obtained and stratified by region. The data was collected by means of a self-fillable questionnaire. RESULTS: More than half (58%) of the physicians were aware and aware of the recommendations, and 62% of physicians reported using them in clinical practice, although general practitioners (non-specialist doctors) did so less often than primary care physicians. Most general practitioners (60%) did not assess cardiovascular risk, with the limited time available for surgery being cited as the main barrier by 81%. The main reason for skepticism about recommendations, given by 71% of physicians, was that there are too many guidelines. Nearly half of the physicians cited a lack of training and skills as the top barrier to implementing lifestyle and behavior change recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Most general practitioners were aware of the Spanish adaptation of the European guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CEIPC guidelines) and knew their content. However, only a third of GPs used the guidelines in clinical practice and less than half used the cardiovascular disease risk assessment tools.",0,0,
983,"Implementing the NHLBI Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents: Rationale and Study Design for Young Hearts, Strong Starts, a Cluster-randomized Study Targeting Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, and Tobacco","BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the underlying atherosclerosis have an onset in childhood, and their presence and intensity are associated with known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Attention to controlling risk factors in childhood has the potential to reduce later risk of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: The Young Hearts Strong Starts study was designed to test strategies that facilitate adoption of the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-supported Integrated Guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents. This study compares guideline-based quality measures for body mass index, blood pressure, and tobacco using two strategies: a multifaceted, practice-oriented intervention versus standard delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Two primary care research networks recruited practices and provided support for the intervention and outcome assessments. Individual practices were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups using a cluster-randomized design based on network affiliation, number of clinicians per practice, urban versus non-urban location, and practice type. The observation units are individual children, since compliance with the measure is abstracted from the medical records of the individual patients. The units of randomization are medical practices. This leads to a tiered design where patients are nested within practices. The intervention practices received toolkits and supported the implementation of guidelines, including academic detailing, an ongoing e-learning group. This project addresses the American Board of Pediatrics' requirements for maintaining certification, including monthly self-statements for physicians, webinars, and other elements of the study. INTEREST: This study offers an opportunity to demonstrate tools and strategies to improve CV prevention in children through guideline-based interventions.",0,0,
984,Implementation of the tobacco tactics intervention compared to usual care in Trinity Health community hospitals,"BACKGROUND: Guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation framework, a study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health compared nurse-administered tobacco tactics intervention to usual care. A previous paper describes the effectiveness of tobacco tactics intervention. This subsequent paper contains data describing the remaining constructs of the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: This pragmatic study used a mixed-method, quasi-experimental design in five Michigan community hospitals, three of which received the tobacco tactics intervention administered by nurses and two received usual care. Nurses and patients were interviewed before and after the intervention. Measures included outreach (patient participation rates, characteristics and utilization of services), acceptance (participation rates and characteristics of nurses), implementation (changes in nurse attitudes before and after training, service delivery, barriers to implementation, opinions on training ). , documentation of achievements and number of follow-up phone calls from volunteers) and maintenance (continuation of the intervention after the end of the study). RESULTS: Reach: Patient participation rates were 71.5%. There were significant increases in self-reported receipt of printed materials at the intervention hospitals before and after the intervention compared to unmodified controls (n=1370, p<0.001). Adoption: In the intervention hospitals, all targeted units and several non-targeted units participated"";"" 76.0% (n=1028) of the targeted nurses and 317 support staff participated in the training, and 92.4% were extremely or fairly satisfied with the training. EXECUTION: Nurses at the intervention hospitals reported an increase in the provision of cessation advice, counseling, medication, handouts, and DVD (all p<0.05) and reported fewer barriers to implementing smoking cessation services (p<0.001). Qualitative comments were very positive ('user-friendly', 'streamlined' or 'saves time'), although problems were noted with showing the DVD and recording it in the electronic medical record for patients. Maintenance: Nurses continued to perform the intervention after the study ended. CONCLUSIONS: Given that nurses represent the largest group of first responders, this intervention, which conforms to the Joint Commission's guidelines for the treatment of inpatient smokers, has the potential to have a large impact on smoking, morbidity, and mortality among inpatient smokers. As we move towards more population-based interventions, the RE-AIM framework is a valuable guide for implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01309217.",0,1,
985,IMPLEmenting a Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Low Back Pain Evidence-Based Management in General Practice (IMPLEMENT): Cluster-randomisierte kontrollierte Studie Studienprotokoll,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from reliable research is not often translated into clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential means of achieving this. A recent systematic review of guideline dissemination implementation strategies concluded that there is a lack of evidence on effective strategies to promote guideline adoption. Recommendations from this review and other studies have suggested the use of theory-based interventions as they may be more effective than those that are not. Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to design and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition that is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in primary care. AIM: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to implement a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary goal is to determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain radiograph and improving the patients' mean degree of disability three months after the consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol describes the details of a randomized, controlled cluster study. 92 general practices (clusters) to which at least one consenting general practitioner belongs are assigned to an intervention or control arm by means of limited randomization. Patients 18 years and older who see a participating physician for acute non-specific back pain lasting less than three months are eligible for inclusion. An average of 25 patients are recruited per GP practice, resulting in a total of 2,300 patient participants. General practitioners in the control arm have access to the guideline via the existing dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioral theory. Investigators (not involved in delivering the intervention), patients, outcome evaluators, and the study statistician will be blinded to group assignment.",0,0,
986,Implementation of a guideline for the treatment of type 2 diabetics: Results of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (C-RCT),"BACKGROUND: In Italy, many diabetics still lack adequate care in the general practitioner's office. We evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies to implement an evidence-based guideline for the management of uncomplicated type 2 diabetes among general practitioners (GPs) of the Lazio region. Methods: Three-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with GPs as randomization units (clusters). 252 general practitioners were randomized to either an active strategy (educational module with guideline), passive dissemination (guideline only), or usual care (control). Data on test and drug prescriptions were collected from existing information systems, while patient data came from GP databases. Process outcomes were measured at cluster level one year after the intervention. The primary outcomes involved measuring glycated hemoglobin and commissioning tests to assess micro- and macrovascular complications. Secondary endpoints were also calculated to assess physician prescribing behavior. RESULTS: Primary care physicians identified 6395 uncomplicated type 2 patients with a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. GP baseline performance data shows low levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in the assessment. The results of the C-RCT analysis show that the active implementation strategy was ineffective for all primary endpoints (OR 1.06 [95% IC: 0.76-1.46], OR 1.07 [95% IC: 0.80–1.43], “OR.” 1.4 [95% IC:0.91–2.16] Passive dissemination of the guideline also showed no effect not improved by a structured learning program, the implementation through organizational measures seems indispensable induce behavioral changes STUDY REGISTRATION: ISRCTN80116232.",0,0,
987,Implementing a Mixed Public-Private Model for Tuberculosis Treatment in Urban Pakistan: Lessons and Experiences,"SETTING: Six cities in Karachi, Pakistan. OBJECTIVES: 1) Strengthen the capacity of general practitioners (GPs) in delivering tuberculosis (TB) treatment through DOTS” and 2) improve collaboration between the public and private sectors on TB management and case reporting. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental study design was chosen to ensure enrollment of TB patients by trained primary care physicians with support from laboratory networks and to improve case detection rate. RESULTS: The following challenges were encountered when implementing the model in urban settings: It was not systematic List of general practitioners available ; the majority of GPs were untrained naturopaths working in squatter settlements where formally trained GPs are most needed; motivation of GPs with high patient burden is very low;"" and access to a laboratory is difficult. Of 35 patients admitted in Q1 (Q3 2009), 87% successfully completed their treatment. CONCLUSION: Public-Private -Mix (PPM) DOTS is feasible in the cities of Pakistan, however, the cost, time and labor required to set up the program is higher than many other developing countries.",0,0,
988,Implementing academic detail for breast cancer screening in underserved communities,"BACKGROUND: Black and Hispanic women living in the New York boroughs of North Manhattan and South Bronx are generally underserved for breast cancer prevention and screening, although they are more likely to die from breast cancer than other women. Primary care physicians (PCPs) are critical in recommending breast cancer screening to their patients. Academic detailing is a promising strategy to improve PCP performance in recommending breast cancer screening, however little is known about the impact of academic detailing on breast cancer screening among physicians practicing in medically underserved areas. We evaluated the effectiveness of an improved, multicomponent academic intervention to increase referrals for breast cancer screening within a sample of community-based city physicians. METHODS: Two medically underserved communities were matched and randomized to intervention and control arms. Ninety-four general practitioners (ie, non-hospital-based) primary care physicians in northern Manhattan were compared with 74 physicians in the South Bronx boroughs of the New York City metropolitan area. Intervention participants received enhanced, physician-led academic detailing using American Cancer Society guidelines for breast cancer screening. The physicians in the control group received no intervention. We conducted interviews to measure primary care physicians' self-reported referrals for mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) and to determine whether primary care physicians taught women how to perform breast self-examination (BSE). RESULTS: Using multivariate analyses, we found a statistically significant intervention effect on the recommendation of CBE for patients aged 40 years and older"";"" Mammography and breast self-examination reports increased in both arms from baseline to follow-up, according to physician self-report. Post-test, physician involvement in additional educational programs, improved self-efficacy in counseling for prevention, routine use of chart reminders, computer-based rather than paper-based prompting and follow-up approaches, printed patient educational materials, mammography performance goals, and increased involvement of nurses and other office staff were associated with increased screening. CONCLUSION: We found some evidence of improvement in breast cancer screening practices due to improved academic detail among primary care physicians practicing in urban underserved communities.",0,0,
989,Implementing the best evidence in smoking cessation treatment for hospitalized veterans: results of the VA-BEST study,"BACKGROUND: Although the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has encouraged compliance with smoking cessation guidelines since 1997, in-hospital smokers do not consistently receive support to quit. METHODS: In a pre-post guideline implementation study at the inpatient medical units of four VA hospitals, the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention (improved academic detailing, changing the nursing admission template, patient education materials and quitline referral, practice facilitation, and staff feedback ) examined ) changed practical behavior evaluated. Pre-discharge interviews were conducted with 824 patients to assess the receipt of the 5A (Ask, Counsel, Assess, Assist, Organize) by nurses and physicians in hospitalized smokers. RESULTS: Subjects were significantly more likely to have received each of the 5A's from a nurse (except for “advice to quit”) during the post-implementation period. More patients were assisted to quit (75% versus 56%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6, 3.1) and ordered follow-up (23% versus 18 %, adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.2) by one caregiver during the post-implementation period. However, unadjusted results showed no improvement in seven-day point prevalence at six-month follow-up (13.5% vs. 13.9%). Nurses' self-efficacy in giving counseling, measured in a survey of 166 ward nurses, improved after implementation of the guideline. DISCUSSION: A multifaceted intervention, including improved scientific detailing, is an effective strategy to improve the delivery of smoking cessation services to inpatients. To promote long-term cessation, more intensive interventions are needed to ensure motivated smokers receive guideline-based treatment (including pharmacotherapy and referral to outpatient cessation counseling).",0,0,
990,"Implementation of clinical guidelines for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in general medicine. Evaluate the effort, process, and patient outcome associated with the implementation of a computerized decision support system","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the implementation of clinical guidelines for diabetes mellitus in general practice using a specific computer-assisted clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. METHODS: Health center-as-a-unit randomized study. Common practice in the provinces of Sor- and Nord-Trondelag in Norway, population 380,000. 17 health centers with 24 physicians and 499 patients with diabetes mellitus were in the intervention group and 12 health centers with 29 physicians and 535 patients in the control group. Main outcome measures were group differences in proportions of patients not registered (process assessment) and mean group differences for the same variables (patient outcome assessment). RESULTS: Statistically significant group differences were found for fractions of patients with no cigarette smoking registration (intervention group, 82.6%; control group, 94.5%), body mass index (78.2% vs. 93.0%), and sufficient registrations for the risk calculation established a score for myocardial infarction (91.1% vs. 98.3%)” all at 18 months. Large center variations were shown for all variables. The only statistically significant group difference was -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -3.8, -0.8) in diastolic blood pressure in favor of the intervention group. Statistically insignificant differences in favor of the intervention group were HbA1c, -0.1% (95% CI, -0.4, 0.1), systolic blood pressure, -1.2 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.4, 2 ,0). Statistically insignificant differences in favor of the control group were proportion of smokers, +3.0% (95% CI, -4.0, 10.0), body mass index, +0.3 kg/m2 (95% CI, -0 .8, 1.4), risk score in females +0.1 (95% CI, -5.1, 5.2) and risk score in males +2.6 (95% CI, -14.2 , 19.5). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of clinical guidelines for diabetes mellitus in general practice using a CDSS and multiple implementation procedures did not lead to a clinically significant change in physician behavior or patient outcome.",0,1,
991,Implementation of clinical guidelines for the treatment of hypertension in general medicine.,"Discrepancies between clinical guidelines and clinical practice require practical implementation strategies. This study evaluates the implementation of clinical guidelines for hypertension in general practice with a specific computer-assisted clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. We conducted a randomized study in general medical centers in the counties of Sør- and Nord-Trøndelag in Norway (380,000 inhabitants). A total of 17 health centers with 24 physicians and 984 patients were included in the intervention group. Data from 887 patients were used for the analyses. There were 12 health centers with 29 doctors and 1255 patients in the control group. Data from 1127 control patients were used in the analyses. The main outcome parameters were the physician's behavior as measured by adherence to the registration of the recommended variables in the Norwegian clinical guidelines for hypertension. The goal of the intervention was to reduce the proportion of unregistered patients. However, there were no clinically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for fractions of patients without recording of blood pressure (intervention group 14.3%, control group 14.2%) or serum cholesterol (62.3% vs. 56.8%) during 12 months, still during 18 months for some of the patients without registering cigarette smoking (82.9% vs. 87.1%), cardiovascular heredity (79.5% vs. 73.4%) and body mass index (81.5% vs. 89.2%). 91.7% of patients in the intervention group and 91.9% of patients in the control group were missing one or more variables required for the calculation of the risk score for myocardial infarction. Large center variations were shown for all variables. The implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertensive patients in the general practice through a CDSS and several implementation procedures did not result in any clinically significant changes in physician behavior. Of importance are both the lack of user-friendliness of the specific CDSS and problems when performing time-consuming multidimensional procedures.",0,1,

993,"Implementing Evidence-Based Practice: Effectiveness of a Structured, Multifaceted Mentoring Program","AIM: This paper is a report on the effectiveness of a structured, multifaceted mentoring program designed to implement evidence-based practice in an intense clinical research setting. BACKGROUND: Barriers to implementing evidence-based practice are well documented in the literature. Evidence-based practice is associated with higher quality care and better patient outcomes than traditional care. However, the integration of evidence-based practice implementation into daily clinical practice remains patchy, and the gap between research and bedside practice remains significant. METHODS: This quasi-experimental, mixed-methods study included three focused discussions with nursing management and shared governance staff, and pre- (N = 159) and post-interventional (N = 99) questionnaires administered between June 2006 and February 2007 . Online questionnaires included measures of organizational readiness, evidence-based practice beliefs, evidence-based practice implementation, job satisfaction, group cohesion, and intention to leave care and the current job. Results. Participants in the evidence-based practice mentoring program had greater increases in perceived organizational culture and readiness for evidence-based practice and values for belief in evidence-based practice than those who did not participate. Qualitative results indicated that leadership's support for a culture of evidence-based practice and the provision of resources for the sustainability of the initiative needed to be a priority for engaging staff at all levels. CONCLUSION: These results confirm other studies showing that nurses' beliefs about evidence-based practice are significantly correlated with evidence-based practice implementation and that the presence of a mentor leads to stronger beliefs and implementation by nurses, as well as greater group cohesion, which is a more potent Predictor for fluctuation rates in nursing.",0,0,
994,Depression implementation guidelines for prescribing antidepressants in general practice: a quasi-experimental review,"BACKGROUND: International guidelines for depression recommend a tiered treatment approach, meaning that antidepressants should not be offered as first-line treatment for patients with underlying or mild depression. In the Netherlands, prescription rates of antidepressants in general practitioners as the first step in treatment are considered high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of guideline recommendations for the prescription of antidepressants. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent naturalistic control group and 3-year follow-up was conducted in a general practice in the Netherlands. General practitioners (GPs) participated in a national quality improvement collaboration (QIC) focused on implementing a guideline-based model for a tiered approach to care for depression. The model consisted of self-help and psychological treatment options for patients with milder symptoms as an alternative to antidepressants in the general practitioner's office. Changes in GP prescription rates for antidepressants were documented over a three-year period and compared to that of a control group of GPs selected from an ongoing national registry network. RESULTS: A 23.3% (49.4% - 26.1%) decrease in the antidepressant prescription rate for newly diagnosed patients with depressive symptoms was noted within the intervention group, while there was no difference in the reference group (50.3% – 52.6%). The decrease over time was significant compared to the usual care group (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.21-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: An implementation program using step-care principles for the allocation of depression interventions resulted in reduced antidepressant prescription rates in primary care. General practitioners can change prescribing behavior as part of a QIC.",0,1,
995,Implementation of guidelines for the prevention of opportunistic infections in inflammatory bowel disease,"INTRODUCTION: Opportunistic infections are an important safety issue in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite the existence of international guidelines, many gastroenterologists have not established routine screening and vaccination. The aim of this study was to modify clinical behavior using a simple screening tool. METHODS: A screening and vaccination form for hepatitis B, varicella, influenza, pneumococcus, human papillomavirus, tuberculosis, hepatitis C, and HIV was provided to each participating gastroenterologist. Gastroenterologists were surveyed before and after the form's awareness of vaccination recommendations and current practice. Immunity rates and the proportion of patients who received the recommended screening and immunizations were documented. RESULTS: 30 gastroenterologists in 8 different IBD centers participated in the evaluation. A total of 919 patients were included (55% female, 65% Crohn's disease, 33% ulcerative colitis, 2% undetermined IBD). The introduction of proforma screening increased self-reported gastroenterologist screening from 47% to 97% before and after intervention, respectively, p<0.001. Following application of the form, vaccination against hepatitis B, chickenpox, influenza, and pneumococcus was recommended in 67%, 2.5%, 75%, and 69% of patients, respectively. Of these, 42%, 39%, 66%, and 49% of patients followed recommendations and were vaccinated. Cervical swabs were recommended in 31%, with 62% receiving the recommended cervical swab. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a screening and vaccination form significantly changed the self-reported behavior of gastroenterologists. Patient compliance with these recommendations was sub-optimal, suggesting the need for further patient education in addition to other forms of support.",0,1,
996,Implementation of International Guidelines for the Management of Osteoarthritis in Primary Health Care: Study Protocol for the SAMBA Steped Wedge Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background Previous research indicates that people with osteoarthritis (OA) are not receiving the recommended and optimal treatment. Based on international treatment recommendations for hip and knee OA and previous research, the SAMBA model for integrated OA care in Norwegian primary care was developed. The model includes physical therapist (PT)-led OA patient education sessions and an exercise program lasting 8 to 12 weeks. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and cost of a tailored strategy to implement the SAMBA model. Methods/Design A cluster-randomized controlled study with a graded wedge design including impact, process and cost evaluation is carried out in six municipalities (clusters) in Norway. Communities will be randomized for timing of transition from current usual care to implementation of the SAMBA model through a tailored strategy. The tailored strategy includes interactive workshops for general practitioners (GPs) and PTs in primary care covering the SAMBA model for integrated OA care, training materials, fact-finding visits, feedback and reminder materials. Outcomes will be measured at the patient, GP, and PT levels using self-reports, semi-structured interviews, and registry-based data. The primary outcome criterion is patient-reported quality of care (Osteoarthritis Quality Indicator Questionnaire) at 6 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes include referrals to PT, imaging, and referrals to orthopedic surgeons, as well as participants' treatment satisfaction, symptoms, physical activity, body weight, and self-reported and measured lower extremity function. Actual exposure to the tailored implementation strategy and user experiences is measured in a process evaluation. In the economic assessment, the difference in the costs of usual OA care and the SAMBA model for integrated OA care is compared to the difference in health outcomes and reported by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Discussion The results of the present study will complement current knowledge on tailored strategies aimed at improving the acceptance of evidence-based OA care recommendations and improving the quality of OA care in primary care. The new knowledge can be used in national and international initiatives to improve the quality of OA care. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02333656",0,1,
997,Implementation of nutritional guidelines - the effect of systematic training for nutritionists in nursing,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 40% of patients admitted to hospital are malnourished. The implementation of dietary guidelines could reduce the incidence of malnutrition and requires education and training for hospital staff. OBJECTIVE: It was hypothesized that an educational program focused on staff behavior would increase recognition of eating difficulties, improve patients' knowledge of appropriate food choices, and increase the number of snacks eaten between meals, thereby increasing the risk of eating disorders would reduce malnutrition. METHODS: A pre- and post-test design was used to evaluate the effect of the nurse training program. The training was conducted in five modules over 1 year and combined questions about nutrition with questions about implementation and theories about the planned change. The program was based on experimental learning theories and the steps of looking, thinking and doing. The effect on patients was measured by a patient questionnaire. RESULTS: After implementing the guidelines, more patients discussed their eating difficulties with staff, received relevant support during the meal, and were served the type of food they ordered and could chew. Patients' knowledge of choosing appropriate foods from the menu increased, suggesting that patients' food intake had improved. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a strategy based on the principles of experiential learning theory and the phases of the look-think-act model facilitates the implementation of dietary guidelines in a hospital setting.",0,0,

999,Translating Research Findings into Practice with Clinical Opinion Leaders: Barriers and Lessons Learned,"BACKGROUND: An opinion leader-led intervention to improve guideline-based medication management for patients with schizophrenia was tested at four Department of Veterans Affairs health care facilities. The concept of using opinion leaders as multipliers of research results and internal agents of change has been widely reported. PROJECT OVERVIEW: Each intervention site received an intensive multi-component intervention over the course of a year. The project's process evaluation included brief, ongoing surveys of physician attitudes and behavior, report minutes of opinion leader conferences, and interviews with the opinion leaders towards the end of the implementation period. OBSTACLES OR PROBLEMS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Several obstacles or problematic issues emerged: (1) physicians do not always agree on who is an opinion leader; some websites may not have an opinion leader; (2) some sites had poorly developed formal and informal social networks among physicians; (3) a focus on physicians only as agents of change;"" and (4) how much direction should opinion leaders be given on how to influence attitudes and behavior? DISCUSSION: Four main problems that emerged during the project offer possible solutions for overcoming them.",0,1,
1000,NHS information technology program implementation: qualitative survey of progress in acute trusts,"OBJECTIVES To describe progress and perceived challenges in the implementation of the NHS Information and Technology (IT) program in England. DRAFT Case studies and in-depth interviews with issues identified using a framework developed from Grounded Theory. We interviewed employees who had been interviewed 18 months ago or new employees in the same positions. RECRUITMENTS Four NHS Trusts for Acute Hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS Senior fiduciary managers and clinicians including CEOs, IT directors, medical directors and nursing directors. RESULTS Respondents unreservedly supported the objectives of the program but had several serious concerns. Implementation continues to be hampered by local budget shortfalls, delays in implementing program-compliant patient management systems, and poor communication between Connecting for Health (the agency responsible for the program) and local managers. New topics were raised. Local managers are unable to prioritize the implementation of the program due to competing financial priorities and uncertainties surrounding the program. They see a growing risk to patient safety related to delays and a lack of integration of program components, and are dissatisfied with ""choose and book"" (electronic booking for primary care referrals). CONCLUSIONS We recommend that the program sets realistic timelines for individual trusts and advises managers on interim IT systems they need to acquire due to delays beyond their control. Advice must take into account the need for trusts to ensure longer-term compatibility with the program and value for money. Trusts need assistance in prioritizing IT modernization, for example by including the implementation of the program in the performance management framework. Even though Connecting for Health takes a different approach of setting central standards with local implementation, these issues still need to be addressed. Lessons learned in the NHS have broader relevance as healthcare systems such as France and Australia seek to realize the potential of large-scale IT modernisation.",0,0,
1001,Impact of stroke prevention trials: addressing the global risk,"Clinical trials have shown that blood pressure (BP) reduction and statin therapy can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stroke regardless of the presence of specific risk factors. These results suggest an alternative approach to secondary stroke prevention that focuses more on global risk than identifying and modifying individual categorical risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. A risk-based approach is warranted because stroke survivors are at high risk for multiple cardiovascular events, not just stroke, and because physiological risk factors such as blood pressure show a continuous or log-linear relationship with cardiovascular risk. The development of adequate risk stratification models for stroke patients is essential for the implementation of such an approach. However, based on the limited evidence available, it appears that most patients who experience an ischemic stroke or TIA are at high long-term absolute risk for a subsequent cardiovascular event and should be treated with all available risk reduction strategies.",0,0,
1002,Role of characteristics and modalities of physical activity and exercise in defining cardiovascular health benefits in the general population: Recommendations of the EACPR (Part I),"Evidence has accumulated over the past few decades that physical activity (PA) and exercise interventions are essential components in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, it is less clear whether and what type of PA and exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, dynamic resistance training, or both) or characteristics of exercise (frequency, intensity, time, or duration and volume) would provide greater benefit in achieving cardiovascular health . This paper, the first in a series of three, will provide specific recommendations on the importance of these characteristics for cardiovascular health in the population at large. The guidelines offered in this series of publications are intended for physicians, health practitioners, kinesiologists, physical and exercise therapists, politicians, public health decision makers and the individual member of the public. Based on previous and current literature, recommendations of the European Association on Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation regarding the type, extent and intensity of PA and exercise are formulated.",0,0,
1003,Improved asthma outcomes through a coordinated treatment approach in a large medical group.,"The aim of this study was to review the development of a multidisciplinary asthma management program in a large medical group practice in an urban area and to evaluate the impact of the program on the processes of care delivery and access to health care for adults and children with asthma. The disease management intervention included the development of a patient registry, a systematic approach to assessing asthma control using the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ), case management, and physician education. An administrative database was used to study hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits. A medical record review was conducted to verify documented adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation practices. The study population at baseline consisted of 3,486 adults and children with asthma. The ATAQ indicated that control problems were common at baseline, with 34% of adult respondents being unemployed due to asthma. ATAQ has also identified several areas for improvement in care. For example, only 20% of adult respondents reported having a written treatment plan. The chart review and analysis of administrative entitlements showed that the program achieved positive results in several areas. Medical record documentation improved for asthma diagnosis (83.3% vs. 98.6%; p<0.001) and patient education (15.7% vs. 26.1%; p<0.001). No improvements were noted in the documentation of possession/use of Peak Flow, smoking cessation counseling, or influenza vaccination. ED visits related to asthma decreased from 148 per 1000 to 88 per 1000 (p<0.001), and hospitalizations related to asthma decreased from 81 per 1000 to 37 per 1000 (p<0.001). Results suggest that this program was associated with significant reductions in hospitalizations and ED use in asthma, as well as significant improvements in several essential care processes.",0,1,
1004,Improved clinical performance and teamwork of pediatric interprofessional resuscitation teams with a simulation-based educational intervention,"OBJECTIVES: To measure the effect of a 1-day team training course for pediatric interprofessional resuscitation team members on adherence to Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines, team efficiency, and teamwork in a simulated clinical setting. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective interventional study. USE: Four tertiary care children's hospitals in Canada from June 2011 to January 2015. SUBJECTS: Interprofessional pediatric resuscitation teams including resident physicians, ICU nurses, board registered nurses, and board registered respiratory therapists (n=300"", 51 teams). INTERVENTIONS: Es a one-day simulation-based team training course was conducted that included an interactive lecture, group discussions, and four simulated resuscitation scenarios, each followed by a debriefing.The first scenario of the day (PRE) was conducted before each team training session.The last scenario of the day (POST) was the same Scenario with a slightly modified patient history All scenarios included standardized distractors designed to elicit and challenge specific teamwork behaviors MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was change (before and after d em training) while adhering to Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines, measured using the Clinical Performance Tool. Results were as follows: 1) change in times to onset of chest compressions and defibrillation, and 2) teamwork performance, measured using the Clinical Teamwork Scale. The correlation between the Clinical Performance Tool scores and the Clinical Teamwork Scale was also analyzed. Teams significantly improved Clinical Performance Tool scores (67.3-79.6%; p<0.0001), time to start of chest compressions (60.8-27.1 s; p<0.0001) , time to defibrillation (164.8-122.0 s; p<0.0001), and Clinical Teamwork Scale scores (56.0-71.8%; p<0.0001). A positive correlation was found between the Clinical Performance Tool and the Clinical Teamwork Scale (R = 0.281; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a simulation-based team training educational intervention significantly improved surrogate measures of clinical performance and time to start of key clinical trials Tasks and teamwork during simulated pediatric resuscitation A positive correlation between clinical and teamwork performance suggests that effective teamwork improves the improved clinical performance of resuscitation teams.",0,0,
1005,Improved delivery of cardiovascular care (IDOCC) through outreach facilitation: study protocol and implementation details of a randomized controlled cluster study in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Innovative approaches need to be found to transfer best practices for the management of chronic diseases into the daily practice of primary care. Primary care plays a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, there is a significant care gap and there are many challenges in implementing evidence-based care. The Improved Delivery of Cardiovascular Care (IDOCC) project is a pragmatic effort that aims to improve the delivery of evidence-based care for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in primary care practices through practice-based brokerage. METHODS: The IDOCC project is a graded wedge cluster, randomized controlled trial in which practice outreach facilitators collaborate with primary care practices to improve prevention and management of cardiovascular disease for patients at highest risk. Primary care practices in a large healthcare region in eastern Ontario, Canada were eligible to participate. The intervention consists of regular monthly meetings with the Practice Outreach Facilitator over a period of one to two years. Beginning with audit and feedback, consensus building and goal setting, practices are supported to change practice behaviors by incorporating elements of the chronic care model. These elements include (a) evidence-based decision support for providers, (b) redesign of the delivery system for practices, (c) improved self-management support tools made available to practices to help them engage patients, and (d) increased linking of community resources to practices to improve patient referrals. The primary outcome is a composite score measured at the patient level to represent each practice's adherence to evidence-based guidelines for cardiovascular care. A qualitative analysis of practice outreach facilitators' written accounts of their ongoing practice interactions is conducted. These textual analyzes will provide further insights into understanding critical factors affecting project implementation. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic, randomized, controlled, graded wedge study with both quantitative and process evaluation demonstrates innovative methods for implementing large-scale quality improvements and evidence-based approaches to care. This is the first Canadian study to examine the impact of a large-scale, multifaceted program to improve cardiovascular quality in primary care. By evaluating IDOCC, it is expected that we will demonstrate an effective, practical and sustainable means of improving the cardiovascular health of patients across Canada.

1006,Improved perioperative antibiotic use and reduced wound infections through computer decision analysis.,"prospective study was conducted over a two-year period to determine whether computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use could improve prescribing habits and reduce postoperative wound infection. During the first year, baseline patterns of antibiotic use and postoperative infection rates were determined. During the second year, computer-generated reminders regarding perioperative antibiotic use prior to surgery were recorded in the patient's medical record, and patterns of antibiotic use and postoperative wound infections were monitored. Hospitalized patients undergoing non-emergency surgery from June to November 1985 (3,263 patients) and June to November 1986 (3,568) were monitored for indications for perioperative antibiotic use, timing of antibiotic use, and postoperative infectious complications. Perioperative antibiotics were considered advisable in 1,621 (50%) patients in the 1985 sample and in 1,830 (51%) patients in the 1986 sample. Among these patients, antibiotics were administered within two hours prior to surgical incision in 638 (40%) of the 1985 sample and 1,070 (58%) of the 1986 sample (p<0.001). Overall, postoperative wound infections were noted in 28 (1.8%) of 1,621 patients in 1985 compared to 16 (0.9%) of 1,830 such patients in 1986 (p<0.03). We conclude that computer-generated reminders of perioperative antibiotic use improved prescribing habits with a concomitant decrease in postoperative wound infections.",1,1,
1007,Improved therapeutic surveillance with multiple interventions: a randomized trial.,"Background Medication errors are often due to improper drug selection or improper laboratory parameter adjustments. The differences between the guideline recommendations and the actual frequency of therapeutic laboratory monitoring are significant. This study evaluated interventions to improve laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy. Methods This cluster-randomized study compared 3 usual care interventions for 10 drugs in 15 primary care clinics in a healthcare organization with an electronic medical record system. Eligible patients, identified from electronic databases, had not received recommended laboratory monitoring within 5 days of study drug re-administration. Interventions included an electronic medical record reminder to the prescribing healthcare professional, an automated voice message to the patient, and pharmacy team contact with the patient. The primary outcome was the completion of all recommended baseline laboratory monitoring. Results A total of 961 patients took part in the study. At 25 days, 95 (48.5%) of 196 patients were in the electronic medical record reminder group, 177 (66.3%) of 267 in the automated voice message group, 214 (82.0%) of 261 in the The pharmacy team contact group and 53 (22.4%) of 237 patients in the usual care group had completed all recommended baseline laboratory controls (p<0.001). After adjustment, the hazard ratios for performing laboratory monitoring versus usual care were 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.5) for electronic health record reminder, 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-5 .6) for automated voice message and 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 4.9-9.0) for contacting pharmacy team. Conclusions All 3 interventions were effective in improving laboratory surveillance during the introduction of new drugs in primary care. More work is needed to determine whether these interventions improve treatment outcomes.",1,1,
1008,Improving antibiotic prescribing in outpatient care: a cluster randomized intervention study using a sentinel surveillance network of physicians,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of the effectiveness of the implementation of guidelines, combined with individual feedback, on the antibiotic prescribing behavior of general practitioners in Switzerland. Methods: 140 general practices from a representative Swiss Sentinel network of general practitioners participated in this cluster-randomized prospective intervention study. The intervention consisted of providing guidelines on the management of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) coupled with sustained, regular feedback on individual antibiotic prescribing behavior over 2 years. The main objectives were: (i) to increase the percentage of penicillin prescriptions for all antibiotic-treated UTIs; (ii) increase the percentage of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescriptions for all uncomplicated antibiotic-treated UTIs; (iii) to reduce the percentage of quinolone prescriptions for all cases of exacerbated COPD (eCOPD) treated with antibiotics;” and (iv) to reduce the proportion of sinusitis and other upper RTIs treated with antibiotics. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01358916). RESULTS: While the percentage of antibiotics prescribed for sinusitis or other upper RTIs and the percentage of quinolones prescribed for eCOPD did not differ between the intervention group and the control group, there was a significant increase in the percentage of penicillin- Prescriptions for all treated RTIs with antibiotics [57% versus 49%, OR=1.42 (95% CI 1.08-1.89), P=0.01] and percentage of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prescriptions for all uncomplicated lower UTIs treated with antibiotics [35% versus 19%, OR=2.16 (95% CI 1.19-3.91), P=0.01] in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, implementation of guidelines coupled with sustained individual feedback did not reduce the proportion of antibiotic-treated sinusitis and other upper RTIs, but increased the use of recommended antibiotics for RTIs and UTIs, as defined in the guidelines.",0,0,
1009,Improving hypertension management through structured physician training and feedback system: Cluster-randomized study,"INTRODUCTION: Our aim was to assess whether treating hypertension with a structured physician information program and feedback system results in improved blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular outcomes. Methods: Cluster-randomized (3:1), open-label, supervised, multicenter study in Germany. Primary care physicians in the information group (IG) received detailed hypertension guidelines training, feedback on target achievement, and a reminder to step up treatment after each patient visit, while the observation/control group (CG) received no such interventions. A three-stage mixed model was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes and non-parallel group-specific changes over time were tested. RESULTS: A total of 15,041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients were in the IG and 4,213 (21.9%) in the CG. After 1 year of follow-up, 82.9% of patients in the IG and 81.5% in the CG remained in the study. The guideline-based blood pressure goal was achieved by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P=0.03), while the individual blood pressure goal was 57.0% in the IG and 51% was achieved in the CG (P = NS). Blood pressure control in the IG was achieved 2 months earlier on average. Clinical inertia, defined as the lack of medication changes despite uncontrolled blood pressure, was significantly less common in the IG group. Cardiovascular outcomes at one year did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: The provision of systematic information coupled with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves guideline adherence. Although the blood pressure control rates achieved are higher compared to previous studies, there is still considerable room for improvement.",0,0,
1010,Improvement of intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in lengthy heart operations through automated alarms in the OR,"Aim: To evaluate the impact of an automated intraoperative alert for re-dosing of prophylactic antibiotics during prolonged cardiac surgery. Design: Randomized, controlled, rater-blinded study. Setting: university hospital. Patients: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery lasting more than 4 hours after preoperative administration of cefazolin unless receiving therapeutic antibiotics at the time of surgery. Intervention: Randomization to an audio and visual reminder on the operating room computer console 225 minutes after administration of preoperative antibiotics (reminder group, n=137) or control (n=136). After a further 30 minutes, the circulating nurse had to indicate whether a follow-up dose of antibiotics had been administered. Results: In the reminder group (93 of 137; 68%), intraoperative re-dosing was significantly more frequent than in the control group (55 of 136; 40%) (adjusted odds ratio 3.31; 95% confidence interval 1.97 to 5.56; P<0.0001). The effect of recall was even greater compared to the 6 months prior to the study period (129 of 480; 27%; P<0.001), suggesting some spillover effect to the control group recovered without re-dosing in 19 of the 44 patients in the memory group. The rate of postoperative wound infections in the memory group (5 of 137; 4%) was similar to that in the control group (8 of 136; 6%; P=.42), but significant lower than in the pre-study period (48 of 480; 10%;"" P = .02). Conclusion: The use of an automatic reminder system in the OR improved adherence to the guidelines for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.",1,1,
1011,Improving adherence to hypertension medication guidelines: cluster randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific recommendations,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention that directs physician attention to drug choice for the treatment of hypertension improves agreement between drug regimens and guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with general guideline implementation in geographically distributed primary care hospitals of a campus-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs health care system. METHODS: Participants were 36 treating physicians and nurses (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group), with results based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A general guideline implementation for all clinicians, including education on guideline-based medication recommendations and goals for adequate blood pressure control, was compared to a printed individualized consultation mailed to clinicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or not the patient was on an antihypertensive medication regimen was in line with guidelines. We measured the change from baseline to endpoint in the proportion of patients from physicians whose drug therapy was guideline compliant. RESULTS: The individualized intervention resulted in more than twice the improvement in guideline agreement compared to the general intervention (10.9% vs. 3.8%, t=2.796, p=0.008). Bootstrap analysis showed that belonging to the individualized group increased the likelihood of agreement by 1.5-fold (P = 0.025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control increased within each study group"";"" however, the difference between the groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: Individualized counseling regarding drug therapy for hypertension given to the physician at each patient visit was more effective in changing physician prescribing behavior than implementation of a general guideline.",0,1,
1012,Improving Adherence and Clinical Outcomes While Containing Costs: Opportunities through Increased Use of Generic Drugs: Best Practice Advice from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians,"Description: The mismatch between healthcare spending and outcomes in the United States has fueled efforts to identify and address situations in which unnecessarily expensive therapies are being used when less expensive, equally effective options are available. The underuse of generic drugs is an important example. Methods: A literature review was conducted to answer 5 questions about generic drugs: 1) How common are branded drugs when a generic version is available? 2) How does generic drug use affect adherence? 3) What evidence is there that brand name and generic drugs have similar clinical effects? 4) What are the barriers to increasing generic drug use? 5) What strategies can be used to promote cost savings through increased use of generics? This article has been reviewed and approved by the American College of Physicians Clinical Guidelines Committee. Advice on best practice: Doctors should prescribe generic drugs whenever possible, rather than more expensive branded drugs.",0,0,
1013,Improving antibiotic prescribing for adults with community-acquired pneumonia: does a computerized decision support system achieve more than academic detail? - A time series analysis,"BACKGROUND: The ideal method for promoting the uptake of clinical guidelines in hospitals is unknown. Several strategies have been proposed. This study evaluates the effects of academic detail and a computer-assisted decision support system (CDSS) on physician prescribing behavior for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The management of all patients presenting to the emergency department for three consecutive periods was assessed"";"" the baseline, academic detail, and CDSS periods. The frequency of the empirical and recommendation-compliant prescription of antibiotics was examined in a temporal comparison with previous and subsequent periods as well as with an interrupted time series analysis. Results: The odds ratio for concordant therapy in the academic detailing period after adjustment for age, disease severity and suspected aspiration compared to the baseline period was OR = 2.79 [1.88; 4.14], p < 0.01, and for the computer-assisted decision mentoring period versus academic detailing period was OR = 1.99 [1.07, 3.69], p = 0.02. During the first few months of the computer-assisted decision support phase, an improvement in antibiotic prescription adequacy was demonstrated that was greater than what would have been expected based on binary logistic model predictions alone over time and academic detail. CONCLUSION: The use of a computerized decision support system was associated with an early improvement in antibiotic prescribing practices that was greater than the changes observed with academic detailing. The sustainability of this intervention needs to be further evaluated.",1,1,
1014,Improving the use of antibiotics by hospital physicians: an academic pilot with a public health approach,"BACKGROUND: The inappropriate use of antibiotics is a major clinical and public health problem. We designed and implemented a clinician-led academic pilot study detailing interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing patterns for inpatients. OBJECTIVE: To improve antibiotic prescribing patterns in the inpatient setting of an academic medical center. DESIGN, SETUP, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians were recruited to participate in this pre- and post-intervention pilot study at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC). In developing the intervention, public health principles were used to create a conceptual framework based on behavior change theory. METHODS: Antibiotic prescribing patterns from 17 hospital practitioners were retrospectively reviewed. Antimicrobial prescriptions were rated as appropriate, effective but inappropriate, or inappropriate. Each hospital worker was profiled and a session arranged to scientifically detail the intervention. The session reviewed improper prescribing practices as well as current practice guidelines. After the detailed discussion, the hospitalists' prescribing patterns were prospectively followed. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The key outcome measures were the proportions of antibiotics inappropriately prescribed before the intervention, during the detailing period, and after the intervention. RESULTS: Seventeen hospital practitioners participated in the study. A total of 247 prescriptions were checked in the pre-intervention phase and 129 prescriptions in the post-intervention phase. Before scientific detailing, 43% (95% CI 37%-49%) of the prescriptions were appropriate and 57% (95% CI 51%-63%) inappropriate. After the intervention, 74% (95% CI 65% - 81%) of the prescriptions were appropriate and 26% (95% CI 19% - 35%) inappropriate"";"" P<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: A carefully planned and methodically implemented intervention can result in behavior change, even in busy hospital workers.

1015,Improving Asthma Care in Emergency Departments: Findings from a Multi-Hospital Collaborative Quality Initiative in Rural Western North Carolina,"BACKGROUND: In North Carolina, nearly a quarter of people with asthma visit an emergency department (ED) or emergency center at least once a year for a worsening of asthma symptoms. The ER Asthma Program was a quality improvement initiative aimed at better understanding the patient population using the ER for asthma treatment in rural western North Carolina and to show whether the ER in small hospitals is doing so through the implementation of treatment of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program could do guidance, improve asthma care and reduce subsequent asthma-related emergency room visits. METHODS: Eight western North Carolina hospitals participated in the project, which ran from November 2003 to December 2007. The intervention consisted of a series of individualized and structured continuing medical education events for ED physicians and staff. In addition, patients presenting to emergency departments with asthma-related problems were selected to complete a brief patient questionnaire to assess their basic understanding of asthma and barriers to asthma management in order to undergo an asthma rating by the treating physician undergo and receive targeted bedside asthma education, a respiratory therapist and finally, at the discretion of the treating physician, receive a complimentary pre-discharge asthma medication package, including rescue therapy with a beta-agonist and corticosteroid therapy administered via a metered-dose inhaler - During the month-long project, a total of 1,739 patients were presented to participating emergency departments for 2,481 asthma-related treatments;"" at 11% of these visits, patients received the intervention, with nearly 100 ED physicians referring patients to the program. Most patients receiving the ED used to treat asthma had the mildest stages, and nearly half were uninsured or covered by Medicaid. A general practitioner or practice was identified in only 20% of the visits. The patient's intervention did not appear to reduce the rate of revisit visits for asthma-related symptoms at 30 and 60 days. LIMITATIONS: Selection bias is likely because patients enrolled in the study were more likely to be adult and insured than patients in the target sample. Because we did not measure ED staff participation in training or their knowledge and attitudes about asthma care before and after the training program, we cannot draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the program in changing their knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients who use the emergency department for care appear to have mild, intermittent asthma and cannot find a regular source of primary care. Efforts to improve asthma management on a community-wide basis and reduce avoidable exacerbations should include emergency department care, as this may be the only source of asthma treatment for many asthmatics. The project showed that regional, collaborative efforts to improve performance in EDs are possible, but that many obstacles stand in the way of this approach.",0,0,
1016,"Improving asthma-related health outcomes in low-income, multiracial, school-age children: results of a demonstration project that combined continuous quality improvement and strategies by community health workers","OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this work was to improve asthma-related health outcomes in an ethnically and geographically diverse population of economically disadvantaged school-age children using a team-based approach with continuous quality improvement and community health workers. PATIENTS AND METHODS. A demonstration project was carried out with 7 community clinics treating _x0001_3000 children aged 5 to 18 with asthma. The entire hospital population with asthma was examined for changes in the care process using random cross-sectional analyzes at baseline and after 24 months (N 560). A subset of patients with either moderate or severe persistent asthma or poorly controlled asthma (N 405) was assessed for specific asthma-related clinical outcomes, satisfaction with care, and confidence in managing asthma through family interviews at baseline and at 12 or 24 months monitored longitudinally. Patient-centered and care-process related outcomes included patient/parent assessment of quality of care and confidence in self-management, review of the asthma action plan, and documentation of guideline-based indicators of quality of care. Direct clinical outcomes included daytime and nighttime symptoms, use of rescue medication, acute care and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days.

1019,Improving cardiovascular risk management: a randomized controlled trial of the effect of a decision support tool for patients and physicians,"BACKGROUND: There is suboptimal adherence of general practitioners (GPs) and patients to cardiovascular risk-reducing interventions. GPs find it difficult to include multiple risk factors in an accurate cardiovascular risk assessment. In addition, communicating cardiovascular risk to patients has proven difficult. OBJECTIVES: To improve primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care by improving patient involvement in the use of a decision support tool. DESIGN: Cluster randomized study. METHODS: Thirty-four general practitioners enrolled patients (40-75 years old) without cardiovascular disease. In a 4-hour interactive small group training session, the general practitioners of the intervention group were trained in how to use the cardiovascular risk guidelines and a decision-making tool. The control group received paper-based educational materials on the guidelines. GP clinical performance and patients' risk perceptions and self-reported lifestyle were measured at baseline and 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-four general practitioners recorded 490 consultations, 276 in the intervention and 214 in the control group. After 6 months there was no significant effect of the intervention on the performance of the general practitioners or the risk perception of the patients. There was only an effect on self-reported lifestyle, with more men in the intervention group than in the control group increasing their physical activity (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.7–8.7).

1020,Improving the care of minority children with asthma: vocational training in public health clinics,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have shown that the lack of consistent primary care for asthma is associated with increased morbidity in low-income minority children. Although effective preventative therapy is available, many African American and Hispanic children receive episodic asthma treatment that does not meet current treatment guidelines. To see if the access, continuity, and quality of care at pediatric hospitals for low-income children in New York City could be improved, we trained staff at the New York City Bureau of Child Health's hospitals to provide ongoing, preventive asthma care to offer. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of the intervention over a period of 2 years in a controlled study at 22 hospitals. Training for intervention center staff was based on National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma and included screening to identify new cases and health education to improve family management. The intervention included strong administrative support from the Bureau of Child Health to encourage staff behavior change. We hypothesized that post-intervention clinics that received the intervention would have an increased number of children with asthma treated continuously in the clinics compared to control clinics, and that staff would reinforce new pharmacological and educational treatments uses. RESULTS: In both the first and second years of follow-up, the intervention clinics showed greater positive changes than the control clinics in terms of access, continuity, and quality of care. Second-year follow-up data include: for access, a higher rate of new asthma patients (40/1000 vs. 16/1000 in; P<0.01); for continuity, a greater percentage of asthmatic patients returning to treatment 2 years in a row (42% vs. 12%; P<0.001) and a greater annual frequency of planned visits for asthma per patient (1.85 vs. 0.88 ; P<0.001) and for quality, a greater percentage of patients receiving inhaled beta-agonists (52% vs. 15%; p<0.001) and inhaled anti-inflammatory drugs (25% vs. 2%; p<0.001) and a greater percentage of parents who reported receiving patient education on 12 subjects from Bureau of Child Health physicians (71% vs 58%; P<0.01) and nurses (61% vs 44%; ""P< CONCLUSION: We conclude that the intervention of the Bureau of Child Health staff significantly improves the ability to identify children with asthma, engage them in ongoing care, and provide them with state-of-the-art treatment for asthma Has.",0,0,
1021,Improving prevention and early detection of chronic diseases in primary care: Results of the BETTER pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Primary care provides most of the evidence-based chronic disease prevention and preparedness services offered by the health care system. However, a gap remains between recommended preventive services and actual practice. This study (the BETTER study) aimed to improve preventive management of heart disease, diabetes, colorectal, breast and cervical cancer and relevant lifestyle factors through a practice facilitation intervention in primary care. Methods: Pragmatic two-way factorial cluster RCT with primary care practices as the allocation unit and individual patients as the analysis unit. The setting was urban practices of primary care teams in two Canadian provinces. Eight practices of the primary care team were randomly assigned to receive practice-level intervention or wait-list control. 4 physicians in each team (32 physicians) were randomly assigned to receive patient-level intervention or wait-list control. Patients, randomly selected from the physicians' lists, were divided into two groups: 1) general and 2) moderate mental illness. The interventions included a multi-faceted, evidence-based, tailored, practice-level intervention with a practice facilitator, and a patient-level intervention, which included a one-hour visit with a prevention practitioner, where patients received a tailored “prevention prescription.” The primary outcome was a composite summary quality index of 28 evidence-based chronic disease prevention and screening interventions with predefined goals, expressed as the ratio of eligible interventions at baseline to achieved at follow-up. An economic analysis was carried out. RESULTS: 789 of 1,260 (63%) eligible patients participated. On average, patients were eligible for 8.96 (SD 3.2) measures at baseline. In the adjusted analysis, control patients achieved 23.1% (95% CI: 19.2% to 27.1%) of target actions compared to 28.5% (95% CI: 20.9% to 36.0%) who received the practice-level intervention, 55.6% (95% CI: 49.0% to 62.1%) received the patient-level intervention, and 58.9% (95% CI: 54.7% to 63 .1%) received practice-level and patient-level interventions (patient-level intervention versus control, P<0.001). The benefit of the intervention at the patient level was seen in both strata. The additional cost of the intervention was CAN$26.43 (95% CI: $16 to $44) per additional action taken. CONCLUSIONS: A prevention expert can cost-effectively improve the delivery of clinically important prevention and screening procedures for chronic diseases.",0,0,

Methods for article inclusion and data analysis were pre-established and aligned with the recommendations of the PRISMA guideline. Two reviewers independently extracted data (study purpose, setting, population, sampling method, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcome, and implementation activities) and assessed the quality of the included studies. Results Of the 6,591 citations originally extracted from the six databases, we included 11 studies in this review. Of these, six (55%) reported statistically significant effects. Effective interventions included liaison nurses to improve communication and coordination of care, and forms to facilitate timely, complete, and accurate handover information. Effective interventions resulted in improved continuity of care (eg, shorter delay in discharge) and fewer adverse events. Contradictory effects were observed with regard to the use of care, namely a reduction in the length of stay compared to an increase in readmissions to higher care. No statistically significant effects in reducing mortality were found. The overall methodological quality of the 11 studies reviewed was relatively low, with an average score of 4.5 out of 11 points. Conclusions This review shows that liaison nurses and transfer forms are promising interventions to improve the quality of patient transfer between the ICU and the general ward. More robust evidence of the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving ICU handover and supportive implementation strategies is needed.",0,1,
1023,Improving compliance with immunization in older adults: results from a randomized cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare three approaches to improving compliance with influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in elderly patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of three parallel group practices in a public urban teaching hospital. SETTING: Public teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients aged 65 years and older (n = 1202) treated by general practitioners (n = 66) in three outpatient medical practices from October 1, 1989 to March 31, 1990 Vaccination standards. The control group received no further intervention. Staff in the second group offered education to patients during their visits. In the third group, the prevention team, a flowchart was used, patient education was offered, and staff roles were redefined to facilitate compliance"";"" in the case of vaccinations, e.g. B. Vaccinate nurses independently of MD initiatives. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The medical records of the 1202 patients studied, including 756 patients treated during both the 1988-89 and 1989-90 influenza seasons, were reviewed to determine documented vaccination provision and receipt. During the intervention period (1989-90), influenza vaccination was offered to patients in the prevention team (68.3%) significantly more often than patients in the patient education (50.4%) or control (47.6%) groups (p=0.006). even after adjustment for patients' previous vaccination status, age, sex, race, and high-risk comorbidity, and for physicians' level of education. Likewise, previously unvaccinated patients in the prevention team were offered pneumococcal vaccinations more frequently (28.3%) than patients in the patient education group (6.5%) or the control group (5.4%) (p=0.001), even after adjusting for factors using multivariate Analysis. For both vaccines, compliance rates did not differ between patient education and controls. Pre-procedure surveys of physicians documented perceived rather than actual compliance for both vaccines, with 89.0% and 52.8% of physicians believing they were complying with vaccination guidelines for influenza and pneumococcus, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide strong support for organizational changes involving non-physician workers to increase immunization coverage among older adults.",0,1,
1024,Improving health care with the Comprehensive Annotated Reminder Tool (CART),"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effect of the Comprehensive Annotated Reminder Tool (CART) on physician adherence to preventive care recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: Using a randomized pretest/posttest control group design, we assigned physicians to the CART group or the control group, followed prospectively, and assessed appropriate adherence to guidelines. The 3 age-specific versions of the annotated CART history and physical examination form contained up to 49 preventive service recommendations. POPULATION: All resident physicians in a large family practice residency program were studied over the course of one academic year. OUTCOMES MEASURED: We performed blinded chart reviews to assess the adequacy of physician-ordered preventive services prior to CART introduction, during its use, and after its removal. A multiple-choice test administered before and after using the CART forms assessed knowledge. RESULTS: When the CART was used, the overall adequacy of physician preventive behavior increased by 21%. The adequacy of history, physical examination, and laboratory procedures increased by 33%. When the CART was removed, the physician's behavior returned to baseline (P < or = 0.0025 for 16 of 20 procedures). No significant differences were observed in the control group over time. Knowledge increased over the study period in all physicians (P < or = 0.005), but was not significantly different between the treatment and control groups (P = 0.608). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the CART significantly improved the physician's performance in providing appropriate preventive care.",0,1,
1025,Improving treatment for depression through an online learning community,"Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and many internists diagnose and treat depression. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a practice improvement intervention on the screening and management of patients with depression in primary care. This before-and-after study design included a physician practice survey aimed at capturing what they thought physicians were doing in practice, a chart audit tool to capture what physicians were actually doing in practice, and an intervention , which included an evidence-based training program. Online toolkit and coaching conference calls to improve practice that encouraged group learning. After completing the intervention, participants increasingly used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to identify, diagnose, and measure treatment success for depression and reported increased use of guidelines and team-based care. Although barriers to improving depression treatment exist, this study suggests that evidence-based quality improvement programs can positively impact practice.",0,0,
1026,Improving Diabetes Care: Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Multicomponent Cardiovascular Disease for People with Diabetes in South Asia - the Multicenter CARRS Translational Study,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes in South Asia. The CARRS translation study will test the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of a clinically-based, multi-component intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes in India and Pakistan. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1146 adults with diabetes, recruited from 10 city clinics, to receive usual care provided by physicians or to receive an integrated intervention to reduce the risk of multi-component cardiovascular disease. The intervention includes electronic health record management, decision support prompts for the health care team, and support from a care coordinator to actively facilitate patient and provider adherence to evidence-based guidelines. The primary outcome is a combination of control of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (blood glucose and either blood pressure or cholesterol, or all three). Further results are the control of the individual CVD risk factors, process and patient-centred measures, cost-effectiveness and acceptability/feasibility. CONCLUSION: The CARRS translation study is testing a low-cost diabetes care model in urban areas of South Asia to achieve comprehensive case management for cardiometabolic disease in high-risk patients (clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT01212328).",0,0,
1027,Improving physician prescribing behavior through policy reflection and prescribing feedback: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Translating research findings into clinical practice, whether through guidelines or feedback on prescriptions, is difficult. AIM: To investigate the effect on prescribing quality of a combined intervention of individual feedback and derivation of quality criteria based on guideline recommendations in peer-review groups. METHODS: 199 general practitioners in 32 groups were randomized to participate in peer-reviewed meetings related to asthma or urinary tract infections. The dispensing of anti-asthmatics and antibiotics by the participating physicians in the year before the intervention period formed the basis for the prescription feedback. The intervention feedback was designed to describe the treatment in relation to the recommendations in the national guidelines. Based on these recommendations, the physicians in each group agreed on quality criteria for their own treatment of the respective diseases. Comparing their prescription feedback to their own quality criteria gave each physician the proportion of acceptable and unacceptable treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in prescribing behavior between the year before and the year after the intervention. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the mean proportion of acceptably treated asthma patients in the asthma and urinary tract infection (control) groups were 28% and 27%, respectively. The average proportion of acceptably treated patients in the asthma group was increased by 6% compared to the control group"";"" this difference was statistically significant. The average proportions of acceptable pre-procedure UTI treatments in the UTI group and the asthma (control) group were 12% for both groups, which increased by 13% in the UTI group compared to the control group. Based on the mean values before the intervention, this meant a treatment improvement of 21% in the asthma group and 108% in the urinary tract infection group. CONCLUSIONS: The derivation of prescribing quality criteria through discussion of guideline recommendations provided physicians with a basis for assessing their treatment of individual patients as acceptable or unacceptable. With feedback on their own prescription, they learned what they were doing right and wrong. This provided a basis for improvement, and the process thus initiated resulted in physicians providing better quality patient care.",0,1,
1028,Improving empirical antibiotic selection through computer decision support.,"Background: Physicians must often start antibiotic therapy before the results of bacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility tests are available. We have developed and evaluated a computerized antibiotics advisor to assist physicians in selecting appropriate empiric antibiotics. METHODS: We used a two-stage, randomized sample study to compare antibiotic consultant-recommended antibiotics with 482 associated antibiotic susceptibility outcomes and physician-prescribed antibiotics concomitantly. The antibiotics prescribed by randomized physicians were then compared between transition periods of antibiotic counselor use. Results: The antibiotics consultant recommended an antibiotic regimen to which all isolated pathogens were susceptible in 453 (94%) of 482 culture results, while the physicians recommended an antibiotic regimen to which all isolated 369 culture results (77%). pathogens were susceptible. ) (P<0.001). The doctors who prescribed antibiotics, to which all pathogens were susceptible, did so a median of 21 hours after collecting the culture samples. Physicians ordered appropriate antibiotics significantly more frequently within 12 hours after culture collection when using the antibiotic advisor than before (P < 0.035). In addition, 88% of physicians said they would recommend the program to other physicians, 85% said the program improved their antibiotic choices, and 81% said using the program improved patient care.

1029,"Improving empiric antibiotic treatment with TREAT, a computer-assisted decision support system: cluster-randomized study.","Background: Adequate antibiotic treatment reduces mortality, while unnecessary treatment is associated with antibiotic resistance. We have developed a computer-assisted antibiotic treatment decision support system (TREAT) that addresses these outcomes. METHODS: Prospective cohort study comparing TREAT advice to physician care, followed by a cluster randomized study comparing wards with TREAT (intervention) to antibiotic monitoring without TREAT (control). We included patients with suspected bacterial infections in three hospitals (Israel, Germany and Italy).

1031,Improving Feedback on Prescribing Errors from Junior Physicians: Mixed Methods Evaluation of a Quality Improvement Project,"Background Prescribing errors occur in up to 15% of in-patient medicine orders in the UK. Residents, however, report insufficient feedback on errors. A barrier preventing feedback is that individual prescribing physicians often cannot be clearly identified in the prescribing documents. Objective To reduce prescribing errors in a UK hospital by improving feedback on prescribing errors. Interventions We developed three interrelated interventions using Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles: (1) Name stamps for trainee physicians who were encouraged to clearly stamp or write their name when prescribing"";"" (2) Principles of Effective Feedback to assist pharmacists in providing feedback to physicians on individual prescribing errors; and (3) Fortnightly Prescribing Advice emails addressing a common and/or major error. Implementation and evaluation In August 2013, interventions were introduced at one hospital site and a second served as a control. Process metrics included the proportion of inpatient drug prescriptions for which residents gave their names. Outcome measures were the perceptions of trainee physicians and pharmacists on the current provision of feedback (evaluated using quantitative pre- and inquiry forms and qualitative focus groups) and the prevalence of incorrect drug prescriptions written by trainee physicians between August and December 2013. Results The percentage of drug orders where residents gave their names increased from around 10% to 50%. Responses to the questionnaire showed a significant improvement in pharmacists' perceptions, but no significant change for physicians. The results of the focus groups indicated an increased commitment by physicians to safe prescribing. Interrupted time-series analyzes showed no difference in weekly prescribing error rates between baseline and intervention periods compared to the control center. Conclusion The results indicate an improved experience with feedback. However, attempts to achieve a measurable reduction in prescribing errors will likely require a multi-pronged approach, which should include feedback.",0,1,
1032,Improving compliance: a randomized trial evaluating strategies to increase beta-blocker use in heart failure,"Background – The dissemination of guidelines for clinical practice has often not been accompanied by desired improvements in guideline adherence. This study evaluated interventions to implement a new practice guideline advocating the use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS - This was a randomized controlled trial in heart failure patients (n=169) with an ejection fraction of =45% and no contraindications to beta-blockers. Patients' primary caregivers were randomized to 1 of 3 interventions in a stratified design: (1) control: caregiver education; (2) Provider and Patient Notification: Computerized reminders from the provider and patient letters advocating beta-blockers;' and (3) Nurse Facilitator: Supervised nurse to initiate and titrate beta-blockers. The primary outcome, the proportion of patients who started or up-titrated and maintained beta-blockers, analyzed by intention-to-treat, was achieved in 67% (36 of 54) of patients in the Nurse Facilitator group compared to 16% (10 of 64) in the provider/patient notification and 27% (14 of 51) in the control groups (P<0.001 for the comparisons between the nurse group and the other two groups). The proportion of patients on target beta-blocker doses at study end (median follow-up 12 months) was also highest in the nurse group (43%) compared to the control group (10%) and the provider/patient notification group ( 2%) (P<0.001). There were no differences in adverse events between groups. Conclusions - The use of a nurse practitioner was a successful approach to implementing a beta-blocker guideline in patients with heart failure.

1033,Improving nurses' hand hygiene behavior through action planning: A pilot study in the intensive care unit and surgical ward,"Adherence to hand hygiene guidelines by clinicians and nurses is generally low, and there is a need to apply effective intervention methods from the social sciences to improve compliance. One method is the formation of implementation intentions (or action plans), in which concrete “if-then” plans are formulated in order to link an eco-label with the implementation of an intended behavioral action. This pilot study examined the practicability and impact of action planning on hand hygiene behavior (HHB) of nurses in an intensive care unit and a surgical ward of a university teaching hospital. A pre-post test design was used and 17 nurses were invited to participate. A trained researcher observed HHB of caregivers before and three weeks after the intervention, in which action plans were formulated. Frequencies were calculated and logistic regression analysis was performed to assess changes in HHB. Of the 17 participants, 10 (seven in the surgical ward, three in the ICU) had complete data and were included in the analyses. A total of 283 potential hand hygiene moments were identified, 142 in the surgical ward and 141 in the intensive care unit. HHB increased from 9.3% at baseline to 25.4% after the intervention (odds ratio: 3.3 in; confidence interval: 1.7-6.5; P<0.001). Although the study was small, the results are promising for the use of action planning to improve nurses' HA in the short term. Action planning has proven successful in bridging the intention-behaviour gap in other areas, and its use to improve HA in healthcare should be further explored.",1,1,
1034,Improved handoff from ICU to ward medical teams with simple paperwork changes,"Medical handover has been highlighted by the General Medical Council[1] as a critical step in patient care, ensuring continuity of care and patient safety, and enabling efficient multidisciplinary functioning. Handoff between critical care team physicians and ward teams at Great Western Hospital upon withdrawal was assessed by reviewing discharge reports and patient notes, and by following up discharged patients. Surrender was noted in only a minority of patients and was not documented in any. Easy changes to discharge papers to prompt and document who the transfer was made to, as well as free up space in the daily review sheets for patients to be completed pending transfer. The first audit results were presented at a local meeting to remind employees of the importance of the handover. These simple modifications brought handover rates up to 100% (n=12). Handover documentation rates also increased from 0% to 100%. This quality improvement project aims to show that carefully targeted, simple changes in practice in identified critical areas can produce dramatic, legally and ethically required results in a very short time.",1,1,
1035,Improving knowledge and behavior change towards guideline-based decisions in diabetes care: a controlled intervention study of a team-based learning approach to the continuous professional development of physicians,"BACKGROUND: Continuing Professional Development (CPD) courses should ideally enhance a physician's knowledge and change their professional behavior in day-to-day practice towards a reference model for best clinical practice and adherence to guidelines. Interactive methods such as team-based learning and case-based learning can impart sustainable knowledge compared to lectures and lead to a high level of satisfaction among the participants. We developed an interactive case-based CPD diabetes care seminar using a team-based learning approach to assess whether it results in improvement in short-term knowledge and behavior change towards guideline-based decision-making and how this learning approach is perceived by participants. METHODS: Questionnaires and an electronic voting system were used to evaluate the motivation, acceptability, and knowledge of the volunteer participants. In addition, in a quasi-experimental design, we analyzed data on index diagnostic tests and referrals of patients with diabetes from participating physicians over a six-month period before and after the course compared to a matched control group. RESULTS: Participants (n=103) rated interactivity and team-based discussions as the main reasons for improved learning. They also expected that the course would change their professional behavior. Participants achieved an average of 43.9% correct answers before the course and 62.6% after the course (p<0.001). Referrals to diabetes specialists increased by 30.8% (p<0.001). Referral for fundoscopy also increased (8.5%, ns), while it decreased in the control group. In addition, participating physicians tested their patients more frequently for microalbuminuria (7.1%, ns). CONCLUSIONS: Our team-based CPD approach was very well received and resulted in an increase in short-term knowledge. It significantly increased referral to diabetes specialists in daily practice, while all other key indicators of professional behavior changed, but not significantly.",0,0,

There is an opportunity to improve monitoring with the potential to reduce therapy complications. Methods The aim of this randomized study was to determine whether computerized alerts were effective in increasing the percentage of outpatients with laboratory monitoring at the start of drug therapy. Physicians and pharmacists have teamed up to develop organization-specific guidelines for monitoring selected medicines. Working with physicians, pharmacists were alerted to missing laboratory test results, ordered missing tests, reminded patients to take tests, assessed test completion, reviewed test results, and managed abnormal results. Eligible participants included patients among 400,000 health plan members who started therapy with any of the 15 drugs. Results In the intervention group, 79.1% (n = 4076""; 95% confidence interval [CI], 78.0% - 80.2%) of deliveries were monitored compared to 70.2% (n = 3522;"" 95% CI, 68.9% - 71.5%) in the normal care group (p<0.001). For example, 78.6% of amiodarone delivery (95% CI, 73.1% - 83.5%) was monitored in the intervention group versus 51.4% (95% CI, 44.4% - 58.4%) in the group receiving usual care (P<0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a computerized tool and collaboration between healthcare professionals in increasing the percentage of patients who receive laboratory monitoring at baseline. The coupling of data available from information systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can lead to improved patient monitoring.",0,1,
1037,Improving mammography referral: a nurse-initiated intervention,"We sought to improve our adherence to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for mammography screening recommendations for eligible patients seen by primary care physicians by employing a multi-pronged intervention aimed at identifying To remove knowledge and behavioral barriers on the part of the residents. Copies of the ACS Cancer Screening Guidelines were posted in all exam and conference rooms and made available to all residents. The intervention to address the behavioral barriers consisted of three components: (1) identification by the nursing staff of eligible women who were overdue for a mammogram when presenting for treatment, (2) completion of a checklist by the residents indicating whether a mammography was or was not recommended and why, and (3) a nurse-initiated backup reminder system for patients who escaped the primary checklist system. A review of 200 preintervention and 270 postintervention charts showed statistically and clinically significant increases in recommended or performed mammograms. Similar statistically significant increases were found in a cohort of 111 patient records at both the pre- and post-intervention audits. The results indicate that an intervention to remove identified resident-dependent barriers to compliance with mammography screening guidelines can be effective in increasing recommended mammography rates.",0,0,
1038,Improving medication management in multimorbidity: Development of the Multimorbidity COllaborative Medication Review And Decision Making (MY COMRADE) intervention using the Behavior Change Wheel,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more chronic conditions, affects over 60% of patients in primary care. Due to the association with polypharmacy, the focus is on the development of interventions to optimize medication management in patients with multimorbidity. The Behavior Change Wheel is a new approach to applying behavioral theory to intervention design. Here we describe how we used findings from a review of previous research, our own original research and the Behavior Change Wheel to develop an intervention to improve medication management in multimorbidity by General Practitioners (GPs) within the overarching UK Medical Research Council Guidance on complex interventions . METHODS: Following the behavior change wheel steps, we searched for behaviors related to medication management in multimorbidity by conducting a systematic review and a qualitative study of primary care physicians. From the identified modifiable behaviors of GPs, we selected one and performed a targeted behavioral analysis to explain why GPs did or did not exhibit this behavior. We used behavior analysis to determine the intervention features, behavior change techniques, and implementation plan most likely to produce behavior change. RESULTS: We identified numerous modifiable behaviors of primary care physicians in the systematic review and the qualitative study, from which active review of medication (rather than passive maintenance of the status quo) was selected as the target behavior. The behavioral analysis showed the abilities, possibilities and motivations of the general practitioners in relation to an active medication assessment. We combined the three intervention functions thought to be most likely to induce behavior change (empowerment, environmental restructuring, and incentives) to form the Multimorbidity Collaborative Medication Review And Decision Making (MY COMRADE) intervention. MY COMRADE is primarily about the technique of social support: two general practitioners jointly review the medications prescribed to a complex multimorbid patient. Four other behavior change techniques are integrated: social environment restructuring, prompts/cues, action planning, and self-incentives. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to use the Behavior Change Wheel to design an intervention targeting multimorbidity and validates the applicability and usefulness of the approach in a complex area of clinical care. The systematic development of the MY COMRADE intervention will facilitate a thorough assessment of its effectiveness in the next phase of this work.",0,1,
1039,Improving transitions in child and adolescent mental health care: a protocol for implementing and evaluating a clinical pathway for the emergency department,"Background While the emergency department (ED) is often a first port of call for children and adolescents with mental health problems (MH), there is limited capacity in this setting to respond to MH needs. Children's MH schemes are typically spread across multiple ministries, organizations and providers. Communication between these groups is often poor, leading to gaps, particularly in the transition of care for this vulnerable population. The Evidence-Based Clinical Pathway for Mental Health in the Emergency Department (EDMHCP) was created with two main purposes: (1) to guide the risk assessment and disposition decision for children and adolescents presenting to the ED with concerns about MH, and (2) to a Streamlined transition to follow-up services with community MH agencies (CMHAs) and other providers. The purpose of this paper is to describe our study protocol to implement and evaluate the EDMHCP. Methods/Design This mixed-methods healthcare research project involves the implementation and evaluation of the EDMHCP in four exemplary ED-CMHA dyads. The Theoretical Domains Framework is used to develop a tailored intervention strategy to implement the EDMHCP. A multiple baseline study design and interrupted time series analysis are used to determine whether the EDMHCP improved health care utilization, medical management of MH problems, and health sector coordination. The primary process outcome is the proportion of patients with MH-specific recommendations documented in the medical record. The primary outcome of treatment is the proportion of patients who receive the EDMHCP-recommended follow-up at 24 hours or at 7 days. Data sources include qualitative interviews, audits of medical records, administrative databases, and patient surveys. A concurrent process assessment will be conducted to assess the degree of variability and accuracy in implementation at sites. Discussion This paper presents a novel model for measuring the effects of the EDMHCP. Our development process will identify how the EDMHCP is best implemented by partner organizations to provide evidence-based risk management for children and adolescents with MH concerns. More broadly, it will contribute to the evidence supporting implementation of the clinical pathway in novel partnerships.",0,0,
1040,"Improving Opioid Safety Practices in Primary Care: Protocol for the Development and Evaluation of a Multifaceted, Theory-Driven Pilot Intervention for Healthcare Providers","INTRODUCTION: Drug overdose deaths are reaching unprecedented levels in North America, largely due to increases in prescription opioid-related deaths. Despite the development of several opioid guidelines, prescribing behavior still contributes to poor patient outcomes and societal harm. Factors at the provider and system level may impede or facilitate the use of evidence-based guidelines”; Interventions aimed at addressing such factors are needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Based on implementation science and behavior change theory, we planned to develop and evaluate a comprehensive opioid self-assessment package designed to increase compliance among primary care physicians with the Canadian Opioid Guideline. The intervention uses practical educational and self-assessment tools to provide prescribers with feedback on their current knowledge and practices, as well as resources to improve their practice. The assessment approach uses a pretest and posttest design and includes both quantitative and qualitative methods at baseline and at 6 months. We will recruit a targeted sample of approximately 10 Ontario primary care physicians from different practice settings who are currently treating patients on long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Quantitative data is analyzed using basic descriptive statistics, and qualitative data is analyzed using the framework method. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The University Health Network Research Ethics Board approved this study. The dissemination plan will include publications, conference presentations and short reports from stakeholders. This evidence-based, theory-guided intervention has implications for the national use of tools to improve opioid quality in primary care. We engage experts and end users in advisory and stakeholder roles throughout our project to increase its national relevance, application and sustainability. The performance indicators could be used as a basis for health system quality improvement indicators to monitor opioid prescription. In addition, the methods and approaches used in this study could be adapted for other opioid guidelines or applied to other areas of healthcare and clinical guideline implementation processes.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General practices from two regions in the greater Sydney area. PARTICIPANTS: 150 primary care physicians recruited between 2006 and 2008 and 221 children with asthma in their care. INTERVENTION: GPs in the intervention group participated in two 3-hour workshops focused on communication and education strategies to enable quality asthma care. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient outcomes included receipt of a written asthma action plan (WAAP), appropriate medication intake, parents' days off work, and children's days absent from school or childcare. GP outcomes included frequency of providing a WAAP and patient education, communication and teaching behaviors, and adherence to national asthma guidelines regarding medication use. RESULTS: More primary care physician patients in the intervention group reported receiving a WAAP (difference, 15%; 95% CI, 2% to 28%; adjusted P=0.046). In the intervention group, children with infrequent intermittent asthma symptoms had less use of inhaled corticosteroids (difference 24%; 95% CI -43% to -5%; P=0.03) and long-acting bronchodilators (difference 19%; 95% CI -34% to -5%; P=0.02).GPs in the intervention group were more confident in communicating with patients (difference 22%; 95% CI, 3% to 40%; P=0.03).

1042,Improving patient care through medical image perception research,"Interpreting medical images across medical specialties is critical to patient care. Healthcare is changing as technology evolves, and clinicians are now increasingly viewing medical images in a variety of settings. Although access to such data is useful, even physicians experienced in interpreting images make mistakes. These errors can become more common as the doctor's work days increase and the number of images to be interpreted increases. To avoid errors in interpreting medical images, we need to understand the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that guide image interpretation. We can then use what we learn to develop better training methods, automated image analysis, and processing tools. We can develop methods to reduce clinical staff fatigue and stress and develop practice guidelines, thereby improving patient care and outcomes.",0,1,

The aim of this study was to provide insight into hospital discharge problems and underlying causes, and to provide an overview of solutions that guide providers and policy makers in improving hospital discharge. Methods The Intervention Mapping Framework was used. First, a problem analysis was conducted that examined the extent, causes, and consequences of ineffective hospital discharge. The analysis was based on primary data from 26 focus group interviews and 321 individual interviews with patients and families and involved hospital and community care providers. Second, improvements were specified in terms of intervention outcomes, performance goals, and change goals. Third, 220 experts were consulted and a systematic review of effective mitigation measures was conducted to select theory-based methods and practical strategies needed to achieve change and better performance. Results Ineffective discharge is related to factors at the level of the individual provider, the patient, the relationship between providers, and organizational and technical support to providers. Providers can reduce readmission rates and hospital adverse events by focusing on quality discharge information, well-coordinated care, and direct and timely communication with their colleagues. Patients or their caregivers should participate in the discharge process and be aware of their medical condition and treatment. Assessments by hospital providers of whether discharge information is accurate and understood by patients and their peers in the community are important examples of overcoming identified barriers to effective discharge. Discharge templates, medication coordination, a liaison nurse or pharmacist, regular site visits, and teach-back are identified as effective and promising strategies to achieve the desired behavioral and environmental change. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive framework of guidance for providers and policy makers to improve patient transfer from hospital to primary care.",0,1,
1044,Improving physician compliance with preventive medicine guidelines,"Similar general practice outpatient clinics with randomized patients were used to evaluate the effectiveness of a program designed to increase domestic staff compliance with preventive medicine guidelines. Two clinics were designated as experimental and two served as controls. In the experimental clinics, age-specific checklists of all recommended preventive measures (taken from the Canadian Task Force report on The Periodic Health Examination and American Cancer Society guidelines) were attached to each patient's medical record. In addition, House Officers were introduced to a series of weekly seminars addressing screening issues as well as the specific recommendations contained in the checklist. In all four clinics, the general practitioners were tested for their knowledge and attitude towards the prevention program before and after the intervention. The number of immunizations and mammograms performed and the total populations eligible for these procedures were determined for all four clinics. As predicted, test results, mammography and vaccination rates increased significantly (from 2 to 40 percent) in the intervention centers compared to controls. We conclude that this intervention was clearly effective in the short term. However, follow-up studies are needed to determine whether the desired long-term effect has been achieved.",0,1,
1045,Improving population-based cervical cancer screening in general practice: Effects of a national strategy,"AIM: To assess the impact of a Dutch national prevention program aimed at general practitioners (GPs) on compliance with organizational guidelines for effective early detection of cervical cancer in general practice. Identify the characteristics of general practice that are critical to success. DESIGN: A prospective questionnaire study with pre- and post-measurement (before and 15 months after the introduction of the national program). SETTINGS AND STUDY PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of one third of all 4758 Dutch GP practices. One family doctor per practice was asked to participate. INTERVENTION: A national primary care physician prevention program to improve population-based cervical cancer prevention, combining different methods for quality improvement in primary care and implemented at national, district and practice levels. Outreach visitors were a key strategy to bring about behavior change. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of practices that adhere to 10 recommendations (in four guidelines) for organizing effective cervical cancer screening. RESULTS: After 15 months, all Dutch practices showed a significant improvement in adhering to nine out of ten recommendations. Two recommendations, specifically ""identify women who should be medically excluded from screening"" and ""send a reminder to non-compliers,"" showed the largest absolute increases of 26% and 33%, respectively. In addition to more intensive care for visiting visitors, practice features such as ""computerisation"" and ""delegation of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant"" were important in order to improve compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION: The national program with a combination of different quality improvement methods proved effective to improve the organization of cervical screening in general practice. The computerization and, to a lesser extent, the delegation of many clinical tasks to the practice assistant and the increased supervision of the practices had a positive impact on the effectiveness of the national programme.",0,0,
1046,Improving prescribing patterns for older people through an online drug use review intervention,"Context: Pharmacotherapy is among the most effective interventions for improving health outcomes in older people. However, because some medications are less appropriate for older patients, systems approaches to improving pharmacy care can be an effective way to reduce inappropriate medication use. Aim: To determine whether a computerized drug use review (DUR) database linked to telepharmaceutical intervention can improve suboptimal drug use in the elderly. Design.—Population-based cohort design, April 1, 1996 to March 31, 1997. Setting.—Outpatient care. Patients.— A total of 23,269 patients 65 years of age and older in the United States who received prescription drug benefits from a major pharmaceutical benefits administrator during a 12-month period. Intervention. â€”Assessment of providers who prescribe via an online computerized DUR database using explicit criteria to identify potentially inappropriate drug use among older people. Computer alarms triggered telephone calls from geriatrically trained pharmacists to physicians, during which principles of geriatric pharmacology and therapeutic substitution options were discussed. main target parameter. – Rate of contact with physicians and rate of change to the proposed drug regimen. Results.— A total of 43007 alerts were triggered. From a total of 43,007 telepharmacy calls generated by the alerts, we were able to reach 19,368 physicians for 24,266 alerts (56%). The rate of switching to a more appropriate therapeutic was 24% (5860), but ranged from 40% for long-term benzodiazepines to 2% to 7% for drugs that were theoretically contraindicated based on patient self-report. With the exception of the rate of change of beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all rates of change were significantly greater than the expected rate of change of 2% from baseline. Conclusions: Using a system that integrates computers, pharmacists, and physicians, our large-scale intervention improved prescribing patterns and quality of care, thus providing a population-based approach to advancing geriatric clinical pharmacology. Future research should focus on demonstrating improved health outcomes that result from improved prescribing options for older people.",0,1,
1047,Improving quality improvement through achievable physician feedback benchmarks: a randomized controlled trial.,"Context Performance feedback and benchmarking, common tools for improving healthcare, are rarely explored in randomized trials. Achievable Benchmarks of Care (ABCs) are standards of excellence achieved by high performers in a peer group and are easily and reproducibly calculated from existing performance data. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of using achievable benchmarks to improve typical physician performance feedback and improve care. Design Group randomized controlled trial conducted in December 1996 with follow-up to 1998. Setting and Participants Seventy physicians in private practice and 2978 Medicare patients with fee-paying diabetes mellitus participating in the Ambulatory Care Quality Improvement Project in Alabama. Intervention Physicians were randomized to receive a multimodal enhancement intervention including a table review and physician-specific feedback (comparative group; n=35) or an identical intervention plus achievable benchmark feedback (experimental group; n=35). Key Outcome Measure Preintervention (1994-1995) to Postintervention (1997-1998) Changes in the proportion of patients who received influenza vaccination; foot exam;"" and each of 3 blood tests measuring glucose control, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels compared between the 2 groups. Results The proportion of patients who received an influenza vaccine improved from 40% to 58% in the experimental group (p<0.001) versus from 40% to 46% in the comparator group (p=0.02) The odds ratios (ORs) for patients of accessible comparators vs. comparators who received appropriate care after the intervention adjusted for the preinterventional care and the nesting of patients with physicians, were 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.96) for influenza vaccination, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.69) for foot examination and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69) for long-term glucose monitoring For serum cholesterol and triglycerides, the achievable benchmark effect was statistically significant only after additional adjustment for physician characteristics (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.08-1.82] and OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.09-1.79]), respectively. Conclusion The use of achievable benchmarks significantly increases the effectiveness of physician performance feedback as part of a multimodal quality improvement intervention.",1,1,
1048,Improving the quality of delirium care in a general practice service with established interdisciplinary care: a controlled study,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to improve the screening, prevention, and management of delirium. OBJECTIVES: Implement delirium guidelines in general practitioner patients to reduce the frequency and duration of delirium and improve outcomes in patients with delirium. METHODS: The implementation was managed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and project staff in a medical ward. The evaluation was conducted as a controlled study in patients 65 years of age or older with/at risk of delirium compared to a medical control unit. Interventions included risk screening, delirium detection, multidisciplinary education, ward modifications including a four-bed delirium ward, behavioral and medication protocols, and the use of nursing assistants and volunteers. The primary endpoints were incidence and duration of delirium"";"" secondary endpoints were length of stay, mortality, falls, and discharge target in the delirious subgroup. Trial measures included station transfers, use of neuroleptics, Allied health screening, and use of Delirium Bay. RESULTS: Of 206 consenting elderly medical patients, 22% were delirious on admission and 44% were at risk. No cases of delirium were identified. In the delirious subgroup, significantly fewer intervention participants were discharged with persistent delirium (32% vs. 71%, P=0.016), with trends for reduced inpatient mortality (0% vs. 18.5%, P=0.07) and falls ( 11% vs. 22%, P=0.16), at the expense of a longer hospital stay (16 days vs. 8 days, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The low incidence of new delirium may reflect the established interdisciplinary care setting. The improved outcomes in the delirious group are encouraging, although implementation has been costly, including longer length of stay in the acute care unit.",0,0,
1049,Improving resident compliance with community care standards: Findings from the VA Cooperative Study on Computerized Reminders.,"Context Computerized systems for reminding physicians to provide appropriate care have not been extensively evaluated in a large number of patients in multiple clinical settings. Aim To study whether a computerized reminder system operated in several Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient clinics improves the resident physician's adherence to standards of outpatient care. Design, Setting and Participants A total of 275 resident physicians at 12 VA clinics were randomly assigned to either a memory group (n = 132) or a control group (n = 143) in companies or half-day clinic blocks. During a 17-month study period (January 31, 1995–June 30, 1996), the residents attended 12,989 individual patients for whom at least one of the standards of care (SOC) studied was applicable. Main outcome measure Adherence to 13 SOCs, tracked using hospital databases and resident-completed encounter forms, compared between residents in the memory group and those in the control group. Results When compliance was measured as the proportion of patients who met all applicable SOCs up to their last visit during the study period, the reminder group had statistically significantly higher compliance rates than the control group for all standards combined (58.8% vs. 53, 5%; odds ratio [OR] 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.42; P = 0.002) and for 5 of the 13 standards examined individually, measuring compliance as a proportion of all visits for which at which residents had care indicated With proper care, the reminder group also had statistically significantly higher compliance rates than the control group for all standards combined (17.9% vs. 12.2%; OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.45 -1.71; ""p < 0.001) and examined individually for 9 of the 13 standards. However, the usefulness of reminders decreased over the course of the study, although the reminders remained active. Conclusions Our data show that reminder systems installed at multiple sites can improve residents' compliance with multiple SOCs. However, the benefits of such systems seem to diminish over time. Future research must explore methods to better sustain the benefits of memories.",0,1,
1050,Improving Smoking Cessation Counseling Using a Point-of-Care Health Intervention (IT) Tool: from the Virginia Practice Support and Research Network (VaPSRN),"PURPOSE: Primary care physician offices are an ideal place to reduce national smoking rates, as >70% of smokers visit their physicians annually, yet patients receive inconsistent smoking cessation counseling. We designed and built a novel handheld computer software program and hypothesized that it would improve physicians' ability to provide patient-specific smoking cessation counseling at the point-of-care. METHODS: A handheld computer software program was created based on smoking cessation guidelines and an adaptation of widely accepted behavior modification theories. The tool was evaluated using a validated before/after survey to measure physician smoking cessation counseling behavior, knowledge, and well-being/self-efficacy. RESULTS: Participants included 17 physicians (mean age 41 years; 71% male; 5 resident physicians) from a practice-based research network. After 4 months of use in direct patient care, physicians were more likely to advise patients to quit smoking (P=0.049) and reported an increase in the use of ""5 As"" (P=0.03). Improved self-efficacy in counseling patients about smoking cessation (P=0.006) was observed, as was increased comfort in providing patient follow-up care (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a portable computer software tool improved smoking cessation counseling among physicians and shows promise for translating findings on smoking cessation counseling into practice and educational settings.",0,1,
1051,Improving testing design in primary care: The added value of a small group quality improvement strategy compared to classical feedback,"PURPOSE: We wanted to evaluate the value of small peer group quality improvement meetings versus simple feedback as a strategy to improve test ordering behavior. The number of tests ordered by GPs is increasing, and many of these tests appear to be unnecessary according to established, evidence-based guidelines. Methods: We recruited 194 general practitioners from 27 local general practices in 5 health regions (5 diagnostic centers). The study was a cluster-randomized study with randomization at the local physician group level. We evaluated an innovative, multifaceted strategy that combines written comparative feedback, group instruction on national guidelines, and peer social influence in small-group quality improvement sessions. The strategy targeted 3 specific clinical themes: cardiovascular problems, upper abdominal disorders and lower abdominal disorders. The mean number of tests per physician every 6 months at baseline and the physician's region were used as the independent variables, and the mean number of tests per physician every 6 months was the dependent variable. RESULTS: The new strategy was implemented in 13 primary care groups, while 14 groups received feedback only. For all 3 clinical subjects, the decrease in the mean number of physician-ordered tests in the intervention arm was significantly larger (an average of 51 fewer tests per physician per semester) than the decrease in the mean number of physician-ordered tests in the intervention arm and the feedback arm (P=0.005). Five tests considered inappropriate for the clinical problem of upper abdominal discomfort decreased in the intervention arm, with physicians ordering 13 more tests per 6 months in the feedback arm (p=0.002). The interdoc variation in the test arrangement decreased more in the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to simply disseminating comparative feedback reports to GPs, the new strategy of incorporating peer interaction and social influence improved physicians' test-ordering behavior. To be effective, feedback must be integrated into an interactive, educational environment.",0,1,
1052,Improving the use of a practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior by training all staff in psychiatric departments via an e-learning-based train-the-trainer program: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In 2012, a multidisciplinary practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of suicidal behavior was issued in the Netherlands. The publication of guidelines often does not lead to a change in professional behavior due to several barriers. Structured implementation can improve compliance. This article describes the design of a study that measures the impact of an e-learning-based train-the-trainer program aimed at training all departmental staff in the use of the guideline. We anticipate that both professionals and departments will benefit from the program. METHOD: In a multicentre, randomized, controlled cluster study, 43 psychiatric departments spread across 10 regional psychiatric facilities in the Netherlands are clustered in pairs with respect to the most common diagnostic category of patients and the mean length of treatment. Pair members are randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. In the experimental state, the entire staff of the specialist departments, i.e. all registered nurses, psychologists, doctors and psychiatrists (n = 532, 21 specialist departments) are trained in the application of the guideline in a one-day, interactive small group -the-trainer-program. The program is supported by a 60-minute e-learning module with video vignettes of suicidal patients and additional instructions. In the control situation (22 departments, 404 professionals), the guideline aims to be disseminated in the traditional way: through manuals, books, conferences, internet, reviews, etc. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated at both health professional and department level. DISCUSSION: Our goal is to demonstrate the effect of training all department staff with an e-learning-based train-the-trainer program in the application of a new clinical guideline. Strengths of the study are the natural setting, the training of all staff, the random assignment to the conditions, the large scope of the study, and the willingness of both staff and management to participate in the study.

1053,Improving the adequacy of antimicrobial use in primary care following the introduction of local antimicrobial guidance at both levels of care,"Aim This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple interventions implemented during the implementation of a guide to improve the adequacy of antimicrobial prescribing in primary care. Design This is a before and after cross-sectional study conducted in the Aljarafe healthcare area (Andalusia, Spain) with a population of 368,728 residents served in 37 healthcare centers. Subjects Subjects include patients with antibiotic prescriptions in 2009 (pre-intervention phase) or 2012 (post-intervention phase), selected by simple random sampling (95% confidence level; 5% accuracy), with infections registered in the electronic medical history. Interventions This study includes training in primary care centers and hospital services, integration of the electronic guide to health services websites, and integration of the digital medical history guide as a decision support tool. Main outcome The study revealed a difference in the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics before and after surgery. Other variables also include age, gender, type of pharmacy, antibiotic prescribed, number of treatments per year, site of infection, and major comorbidities. Sources In addition, this study used computerized pharmacy records of reimbursed and dispensed drugs and electronic medical histories. Results The percentage of appropriate antibiotic prescriptions increased from 36% in 2009 to 57% in 2012 (p?<?0.001). Improvement was observed in patients of all ages and genders and was greater in patients of working age and those with comorbidities. The best results were observed in the beta-lactam group and in the treatment of respiratory and skin infections. Conclusion Implementing multifactorial interventions involving professionals from both levels of care could be an effective strategy to improve antimicrobial use in primary care.",0,1,
1054,Improving the care of people with acute low back pain by healthcare professionals (the ALIGN study): A cluster-randomized study protocol,"Background In many areas of healthcare, there are differences between the recommendations of clinical practice guidelines and actual clinical practice. A 2004 systematic review examining the effectiveness of interventions to promote guideline implementation concluded that there was a lack of evidence to support decisions about effective interventions to promote guideline implementation. In addition, the review recommended the use of theory in developing implementation measures. In Australia (2003) a clinical practice guideline for the management of acute back pain was developed. Acute low back pain is a common condition, has a high burden, and there is some evidence of an evidence-practice gap in the related health environment. This provides an opportunity to design and test a theory-based implementation intervention that, if effective, may bring benefits to patients with this condition. Aims This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention to increase the compliance of alternative practitioners (physiotherapists and chiropractors in Victoria, Australia) with a clinical practice guideline for acute non-specific low back pain (LBP) compared to providing practitioners with a printed copy the guideline. Specifically, our primary goal is to determine whether the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of acute nonspecific LBP patients who are either referred or X-rayed and in improving the mean degree of disability for patients three months after onset of acute LBP . Methods The study design is a cluster-randomized study. Using limited randomization, 210 practices (clusters) were assigned to an intervention or control group. Practitioners in the control group received a printed copy of the guideline. Practitioners in the intervention group received a theory-based intervention designed to address prospectively identified barriers to practitioner adherence to the guideline. The intervention consisted primarily of an educational symposium. Patients 18 years and older who visit a participating physician for acute non-specific LBP of less than three months duration over a two-week data collection period, three months after the intervention symposia, are eligible for enrollment. Sample size calculations are based on enrolling 15 to 40 patients per practice. Outcome raters are blinded to group assignment.",0,1,
1055,"Improving hypertension management in Kazakhstan: Implications for improving clinical practice, patient behavior and health outcomes","This paper presents results from the evaluation of a strategy aimed at improving case finding and management of hypertensive patients. Study results suggest that aligning providers with clinical guidelines, public information about hypertension risks, encouraging annual blood pressure screening, and universal access to an outpatient medication package improve case finding and management. Additionally, training providers at pilot sites resulted in a substantial and significant difference in patient care and health outcomes. Training and tools for providers, specifically focused on effective patient counseling, made a significant contribution to improved case finding, patient adherence to prescribed medications, less salt and more regular exercise. However, further refinement is needed to achieve the expected patient adherence to medication and lifestyle advice. In the pilot area, we compared two samples of patients before and after the start of the intervention. We found an increase in the proportion of patients with blood pressure or =160/100 mmHg. The strategy included the joint efforts of the Research Institute of Cardiology and Internal Diseases, Drug Information Center of Karaganda, Karaganda Oblast Health Department, Kazakh Association of General Practitioners, Almaty Postgraduate Institute for Physicians and USAID ZdravPlus project in Central Asia.",0,0,
1056,Improving bipolar disorder outcome through non-pharmacological strategies: the role of psychoeducation,"The present work deals with the effectiveness of psychoeducation and related strategies in bipolar disorders. Recently, several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of psychological interventions as a prophylactic adjunct to medication, namely identification of prodromal signs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, and family-centered interventions. All of these studies are presented here along with the pioneering studies in this field. There are several themes that any psychoeducational program should contain to ensure its usefulness and they are summarized in twelve points. Broadly speaking, psychoeducation should include general information about bipolar disorder, elements of compliance improvement, instruction in early detection of relapse, and lifestyle regularity issues. Today, several treatment guidelines include psychoeducation as a crucial prophylactic tool. Clinicians should be aware of this and start implementing psychoeducation in their daily clinical practice.",0,0,
1057,Improving the success of postal intervention programs to influence prescribing behavior: a review,"BACKGROUND: Educational interventions have long been used as a means of influencing prescribing behavior. Various techniques, including educational mailings, scientific detailing, feedback from prescribers with or without disclosure of patient identification data, and supplemental patient information, have been used to encourage appropriate prescribing habits, reduce costs, and optimize patient care. While the effects of educational intervention programs are well reported, little information is available on the effectiveness of various intervention techniques by mail. OBJECTIVE: To review the effectiveness of intervention programs by mail and identify factors that may promote successful outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted via PubMed for reports of mailed intervention programs published up to May 2012. Specific search terms included Drug Usage Review, Drug Usage, Medicaid, Prescribing Feedback, Mailed Doctor Intervention, and Mailed Doctor Notices. Identified publications that met the following criteria were selected for inclusion: (a) evaluated printed educational materials distributed by mail, (b) occurred in an outpatient setting, and (c) measured impact of the intervention on patterns of prescribing, utilization of health care or profitability results. Publications that met all three criteria were abstracted by intervention strategy, follow-up period, data source, intervention goal, prescriber acceptance of the intervention, and impact on prescribing patterns, health care utilization, and economic outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 40 published reports on 39 unique interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority (34/39 [87.2%]) of studies were conducted in state or federally funded programs; only 5 programs involved private insurers. All programs used follow-up periods of </= 12 months after dispatch of the final intervention. A total of 26 of the 39 unique interventions reported a positive effect on at least 1 outcome. Programs that included a second recipient such as a pharmacist (n=4) reported a greater effect compared to interventions mailed only to prescribing physicians. Identification data had a higher success rate than those providing prescribing feedback and/or educational materials (21/25 [84.0%] vs. 5/14 [35.7%]); it should be noted that 2 of the 5 successful programs that provided non-patient identifying materials also used academic detail. Programs that sent educational materials and/or feedback from prescribers on multiple drug classes or disease states had minimal impact on prescribing patterns (n = 4). ic disease or medication supported by appropriate evidence produced a favorable change in a short period of time. In addition, providing recommendations supported by commonly accepted clinical guidelines or literature was also associated with a high success rate. A subset of programs designed to assess health care utilization (n=5) and economic impact (n=9) observed little change in measured outcomes. Analysis of prescriber response sheets conducted by 7 programs found that changes in therapy occurred in approximately 50% of patients with prescribers who intended to accept intervention recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the degree of heterogeneity between articles prevents the provision of unequivocal results, it appears that a well-designed post-intervention program has the potential to evoke significant changes in prescribing patterns. Prescribers appear receptive to mail-in interventions;' however, there is limited data to determine the association between acceptance and actual prescription change. Future research should focus on identifying barriers that may prevent acceptance of recommendations from leading to changes in therapy. Projects should include longer evaluation periods to assess the duration of action after the final intervention has been dispatched and the potential impact on healthcare and patient outcomes determine economic outcomes.",0,1,
1058,Improving the use of early follow-up after emergency room visits. A randomized study,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the adequacy of parents' uptake of early follow-up after emergency department (ED) visits can be improved by post-visit support from a nurse. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial, single blinded. SETTING: Urban University Hospital ED connected to the hospital's primary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of 190 children less than 8 years of age treated for acute illness in the emergency department who, at the discretion of the emergency department clinicians, were treated as outpatients with follow-up at the primary care center. INTERVENTION: Parents in the experimental group were called by a caregiver who offered both individualized follow-up guidance and access to a caregiver for further assistance if needed. The control group received “usual” follow-up counseling during ED visits. MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: In the week following the ED visits, parents in the experimental group were more compliant with follow-up instructions (79% vs. 61%) and less likely to miss appointments compared to parents in the control group ( 15% vs. 31%), and less likely to 'shop' elsewhere for care (2% vs. 9%). The adequacy of follow-up care was assessed in a 'blind' manner against pre-established guidelines. Inappropriate use of aftercare was significantly reduced in subjects in the experimental group (10% vs. 20%). CONCLUSION: Nurse practitioner intervention improved follow-up utilization by parents in our sample. Overall care for episodic ED users could be improved through similar interventions.",0,0,
1059,In the tepid defense of public health: doctors and antibiotic resistance,"Antimicrobial resistance threatens populations as a serious public health threat and a costly social problem. Recent proposals to tackle antimicrobial resistance have focused heavily on supply-side approaches. Suggestions include playing around with patent rights so drug companies have more incentive to discover new antibiotics and resist overselling of their newer drugs already on the market. Unfortunately, this article argues that a primarily supply-side emphasis distracts attention from the important demand-side influences of physicians. Physicians have an important and indispensable task to ensure optimal social access to antibiotics. Worryingly, doctors' management of antibiotic supplies has been poor and their defense of public health lukewarm at best. Acting as a prudent steward of antibiotic supplies often seems at odds with a physician's commonly understood fiduciary duties, ethical obligations, and professional standards, all of which traditionally emphasize the individual health paradigm as opposed to responsibility for the health of the community. Meanwhile, physicians face limited incentives to retain antibiotics from other sources, such as B. liability for medical malpractice, regulatory standards and reimbursement systems. While multiple efforts are required to effectively combat antimicrobial resistance, physician gatekeeping behavior should become a priority. This article examines how public health laws and policy instruments could positively change the incentives for physicians to conserve antibiotics. A clear lesson from recent managed care reform struggles is that, for interventions to have the best chance of success, they must respect physicians' interest in clinical autonomy and individualized medicine, even if, somewhat paradoxically, public health perspectives are vigorously promoted . In addition, the legal and ethical responsibilities of physicians related to antibiotics need to be redesigned to better support gatekeeping to protect public health. The main recommendation is to increase the use of financial incentives to reward physicians for adhering to recommended antibiotic prescribing guidelines. While not a panacea, greater experimentation with financial incentives may provide a much-needed boost to physician interest in antibiotic preservation and is probably the best way to address physicians' legitimate concerns about clinical autonomy.",0,0,
1060,"For treatment-resistant depression, adding cognitive behavioral therapy to usual care was cost-effective at 1 year","Question Is adding individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to usual care cost-effective for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression? Methods Design Cost-benefit analysis from a UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective, based on a one-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (CoBalT trial). Setting up primary care practices in Bristol, Exeter and Glasgow, UK. Patients 469 patients aged 18 to 75 years (mean age 50 years, 72% females) who were on antidepressants for 6 weeks but persisted with depressive symptoms, who were diagnosed with depression using the revised clinical interview schedule and had a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II score ¡Ã 14. Intervention Individual CBT, 12 to 18 one-hour sessions, conducted in general practitioner offices or similar settings, plus usual care (n = 234) or usual care alone (n = 235). Usual treatment might include antidepressants. Outcomes Treatment response (¡Ã50% reduction in BDI-II score)""; Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on EQ-5D-3L scores and quality of life assessments from the UK general population; Cost in 2010 pounds sterling Sterling {UK Â¡Ãª1 = US $1.56}*;"" and incremental cost-benefit ratio (ICER). Costs included NHS and PSS costs derived from primary care records, CBT therapist records and patient questionnaires.

1061,Inclusion and exclusion criteria in randomized controlled trials on psychotherapy in PTSD,"OBJECTIVE: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a widespread and often disabling condition. Fortunately, effective psychological treatments for PTSD are available. However, research shows that these treatments may be underused in clinical practice. One reason for this underutilization could be the unjustified exclusion of patients from these treatments by physicians based on their understanding of the exclusion criteria used in clinical trials of psychological treatments for PTSD. There is no comprehensive and up-to-date review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria used in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of the psychological treatment of PTSD. Therefore, our goal was to better understand how patients were excluded from such RCTs in order to provide clinicians with guidance on which clinical populations are likely to benefit from these treatments. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of RCTs on psychological treatments for PTSD from January 1, 1980 to April 1, 2012. We categorized these clinical trials according to the types of psychotherapy discussed in major PTSD treatment guidelines and reviewed all treatments reviewed in at least two RCTs (N=64 published trials with 75 intervention arms, as some trials have two or more interventions compared). We have abstracted and tabulated information on exclusion criteria for each type of psychotherapy for PTSD. RESULTS: We identified multiple RCTs on cognitive behavioral therapy (n=56), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (n=11), and group psychotherapy (n=8) for PTSD. The most common exclusions were psychosis, substance abuse and addiction, bipolar disorder, and suicidal ideation. Clinical trials varied in how rigorously these criteria were applied. It is important to note that no exclusion criterion was used in any of the studies and that there was at least one study of each type of therapy that included patients from each of the commonly excluded groups. Evidence is limited for treating patients with PTSD and four comorbidities: alcohol and drug abuse or dependence at current use, current psychosis, current mania, and current suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological treatments for PTSD have been studied in broad and representative clinical populations. It appears that more generous use of these treatments is warranted regardless of comorbidities.",0,0,
1062,"INCOG Recommendations for the Management of Cognition after Traumatic Brain Injury, Part III: Executive Function and Self-Awareness","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in complex cognitive (and other) consequences. Impairments in executive function and self-esteem are among the most characteristic neurobehavioral sequelae and can have profound implications for resuming previous life roles. An international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) came together to develop recommendations for interventions to improve impairments in executive function and self-esteem after TBI. METHODS: The team reviewed the available literature and ensured that the recommendations were up to date. To encourage implementation, the team developed decision-making algorithms that incorporate the recommendations based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of published studies. The team then prioritized the recommendations for implementation and developed test criteria to assess compliance with best practice recommendations. RESULTS: Intervention programs that include metacognitive strategy instructions for planning, problem solving, and other cognitive-executive impairments have a solid evidence base. New findings support the use of strategies for the targeted improvement of logical skills. There is significant support for using direct corrective feedback to improve self-awareness. CONCLUSIONS: A growing number of scientifically well-designed studies are available demonstrating the effectiveness of a variety of interventions in resolving impairments in executive function and self-esteem after TBI.",0,0,
1063,Increasing Compliance with an Antibiotic Prophylactic Policy to Prevent Infection at Pediatric Surgical Sites: Before and After the Study,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an intervention to improve adherence to antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) guidelines to prevent postoperative wound infections in children. BACKGROUND: Although adequate AP reduces surgical site infections and guidelines improve the quality of care, changing practice is difficult. To enable behavior change, several barriers need to be addressed. METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force at a children's hospital developed an evidence-based AP guideline. Subsequently, the guideline was posted in operating rooms and the online form, only recommended antibiotics were available in operating rooms, incoming trainees were given orientation, antibiotic verification was included in time-out, computerized alerts were set up for inappropriate postoperative prophylaxis, and surgeons were given z -Mails when policy has not been followed. AP indication and administration were documented for surgical procedures in July 2008 (preintervention), September 2011 (postintervention) and April-May 2013 (follow-up). Compliance was defined as complete - appropriate antibiotic, dose, timing, re-dosing and duration when prophylaxis was indicated; partially - appropriate drug and timing when prophylaxis was indicated; and appropriate use - complete compliance when prophylaxis indicated, no antibiotics when not indicated Pre- and post-procedure compliance was compared with Chi(2) tests RESULTS: AP was 43.9% (187/426) and 62, 0% (124/200) of surgical procedures indicated before and after surgery There were significant improvements in appropriate antibiotic use (51.6% - 67.0%; P<0.001), more complete (26.2% - 53.2 %; P < 0.001) and partial compliance (73.3% - 88.7%, P = 0.001), correct dosing (77.5% - 90.7%; P = 0.003), timing (83.3% - 95.8%; p=0.001), re-dosing (62.5%-95.8%, p=0.003), and duration (47.1%-65.3%);"" P<0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted intervention improved compliance with a pediatric AP guideline.",0,0,
1064,Increasing compliance in low tidal volume ventilation in the ICU with two nudge-based interventions: Assessed by intervention time series analyses,"OBJECTIVES: Low tidal volume ventilation (TVe) improves outcomes in ventilated patients and the majority of clinicians report using it. Unfortunately, most patients never get low TVs. “Nudges” influence decision-making with subtle cognitive mechanisms and are effective in many contexts. There are few studies that have examined its impact on clinical decision making. We examined the impact of 2 interventions designed according to behavioral science principles on the use of low-TVe ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). SETTING: University Hospitals Bristol, a 20-bed tertiary, mixed medical and surgical intensive care unit that welcomes over 1300 patients per year. PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from 2144 consecutive patients who received controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 1 hour between October 2010 and September 2014. Patients on controlled mechanical ventilation for more than 20 hours were included in the final analysis. ACTIONS: (1) Default ventilator settings were adjusted to meet low TVe targets from the start of ventilation unless actively changed by a clinician. (2) A large dashboard was provided showing TVs in ml/kg ideal body weight (IBW) format with warnings when TVs were too high. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: TVe in ml/kg IBW. RESULTS: TVe was significantly lower in the defaults group. With the dashboard intervention, the TVe fell faster and by a greater amount compared to controls after exceeding a TVe of 8 mL/kg IBW. This effect improved in each subsequent year for 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that adjusting default ventilator settings and a dashboard of excessive TVe alerts can significantly impact clinical decision-making. This offers a promising strategy to improve compliance with low TVe ventilation and suggests that leveraging insights from behavioral science has the potential to improve the translation of evidence into practice.",1,1,
1065,Increasing the quantity and quality of the search for current best evidence to answer clinical questions: Protocol and intervention design of the MacPLUS FS Factorial Randomized Controlled Trials,"Background and Aims Finding the current best evidence for clinical decisions remains a challenge. With 3,000 new studies published every day, no single evidence-based source provides all the answers or is sufficiently updated. McMaster Premium Literature Service - Federated Search (MacPLUS FS) addresses this problem by simultaneously searching across multiple high-quality resources and displaying the results in a one-sided pyramid, with the most clinically useful at the top. However, additional logistical and educational barriers need to be addressed to improve the search for evidence at the point-of-care. This study aims to test three innovative interventions among MacPLUS FS enrolled clinicians to increase the quantity and quality of the search for the current best evidence to answer clinical questions. Methods & Design In a user-centered approach, we developed three interventions embedded in MacPLUS FS: (A) a web-based clinical question recorder; (B) an Evidence Retrieval Coach consisting of eight short instructional videos; (C) an audit, feedback and gamification approach to evidence retrieval based on the assignment of ""badge"" and ""reputation scores"". We will conduct a randomized factorial controlled trial among all 904 eligible physicians currently enrolled in MacPLUS FS at McMaster University Hospitals, Canada. Postgraduate trainees (n=429) and clinical faculty/staff (n=475) will be randomized to each of the three following interventions in a factorial design (A x B x C). Usage is continuously recorded across clinicians' accounts, which track logins and usage down to the level of single keystrokes. The primary result is the search rate per month per user over the six months of tracking. Secondary outcomes, measured using the Validated Impact Assessment Method Questionnaire, include: usefulness of the responses found (satisfying clinicians' information needs), usage (application in practice), and perceived usefulness to patient outcomes. Discussion Building on effective models for point-of-care teaching, these interventions approach evidence gathering as a clinical skill. If effective, they can provide an opportunity to improve them for large audiences at low cost, while providing greater access to relevant evidence across many top EBM resources.",0,0,

1068,Individuals with back pain: how do they view physical activity?,"BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for people with acute low back pain have advocated early return to normal activity and increased physical activity. Little is known about the association between low back pain and physical activity, and the implications of this association for promoting increased levels of physical activity in a general practitioner population. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate associations between factors influencing changes in physical activity and how individuals perceive and behave about their back pain, and the impact of these perceptions and behaviors on physical activity. METHODS: Twenty-seven informants were selected using a targeted sample from a larger group of people who had been referred by their GPs for their back problems to a community-based, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted by the University of York to evaluate the efficacy and Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a progressive training program. 54 interviews were conducted with this subset of the RCT"";"" four informants were interviewed once, 19 twice and four of them three times. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using manual and computer-assisted approaches. RESULTS: Physical activity was perceived as (i) activities of daily living, (ii) activities that cause shortness of breath and which they did not avoid, and (iii) more competitive activities. Avoidance of physical activity and fear of recurring pain were the two main factors directly associated with informants' back and changes in physical activity. These two factors hampered an increase in physical activity, although the majority of respondents strongly believed that physical activity helped reduce their back pain. CONCLUSIONS: When addressing the issue of returning to or increasing physical activity in individuals with acute low back pain, it is important for clinicians to recognize physical activity avoidance and/or fear of pain at the earliest stages in order to design counseling and reassurance appropriately. When activity avoidance and fear of pain are identified and clinicians want to encourage patients to engage in and maintain more physical activity, they should examine issues of pain anxiety, avoidance of, and confidence in physical activity, among other contributing factors to physical activity.",0,0,

1070,Infectious diseases in general practice and prescription of antibiotics. Observational study in Sicily,"Studies on drug consumption have shown large differences between different countries in prescribing behavior in general medicine. For example, in Italy, the choice of antibiotic prescribing seems to indicate a wider use of parental antibiotics. The aim of this study was to describe the prescribing pattern and therapeutic doses of antibiotics used by Sicilian General Practitioners (GPs) and to assess their prescribing attitudes towards the use of parental ones. Each physician had to fill out a questionnaire over a 6-month period for each therapeutic intervention that ended with a prescription of antibiotics. Diagnosis and medication were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Anatomical Therapeutic-Chemical Classification (ATC), respectively. On 9395 prescriptions made by 76 doctors in 25 Sicilian cities, the analysis revealed that acute respiratory problems are the most common indication (31.7%) for a medical consultation and that macrolides [such as azithromycin (8.8%) and clarithromycin (8.3%)] , penicillin [such as amoxicillin (7.1%) and co-amoxiclav (8.4%)], third generation cephalosporins [such as cefixime (5.5%) and ceftriaxone (5.1% )] represent the most commonly used therapeutic groups. The choice of route of administration was influenced by the patient's age and, more importantly, by symptoms and signs of the disease, rather than by bacteria suspected of causing the disease. In summary, our data clearly indicate a lack of knowledge about antibacterial therapy guidelines among general practitioners in Sicily, as well as the need for independent training to improve antibiotic knowledge and reduce healthcare costs.",0,0,
1071,Impact of patient inquiries for direct-to-consumer advertised antidepressants: a randomized controlled trial,"Context Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising for prescription drugs in the United States is both ubiquitous and controversial. Critics charge that this leads to overprescription, while proponents counter that it helps prevent underuse of effective treatments, particularly for conditions that are poorly recognized or stigmatized. Objective To determine the impact of DTC-related patient inquiries on physicians' initial treatment decisions in patients with depressive symptoms. Design Randomized study with standardized patients (SPs). Six SP roles were created by crossing 2 conditions (major depression or adjustment disorder with depressed mood) with 3 requirement types (brand specific, general, or none). Establishment of primary care practices in Sacramento, California, San Francisco, California, and Rochester, NY between May 2003 and May 2004. Participants One hundred and fifty-two primary care physicians and general internists recruited from individual and group practices and health care organizations;"" Cooperation rates ranged from 53% and 61% Interventions SPs were randomly assigned to 298 unannounced visits, with assignments restricted such that physicians saw 1 SP with major depression and 1 SP with adjustment disorder At approximately one-third of the visits, the SPs made a brand-specific drug request, a general drug inquiry or no inquiry (control condition) Key outcome measures Data on prescribing, mental health referral, and follow-up in primary care obtained from written reports of the SP, audio recordings of visits, review of charts, and analysis of written chen prescriptions and drug samples. The effects of request type on prescribing were assessed using contingency tables and confirmed in generalized linear mixed models that accounted for clustering and adjusted for site, physician, and visit characteristics. Results Standardized patient role compliance was excellent, and the suspicion rate that physicians had seen an SP was 13%. For major depression, the antidepressant prescription rate was 53%, 76%, and 31% for SPs making brand-specific, general, and no requests, respectively (P<0.001). For adjustment disorders, antidepressant prescription rates were 55%, 39%, and 10%, respectively (p<0.001). The results were confirmed in multivariate models. Minimally acceptable initial care (any combination of antidepressant medication, mental health referral, or follow-up within 2 weeks) was offered to 98% of SPs in the major depressive role who made a general inquiry, 90% of those who made a brand-specific inquiry, and 56% of those who did not inquire (P<0.001). Conclusions Patient inquiries have a profound impact on physician prescribing for major depression and adjustment disorders. Direct mail can have competing effects on quality, potentially both preventing underuse and encouraging overuse.",0,0,
1072,Influence on lifestyle interventions and five-year coronary risk from a comprehensive lifestyle intervention program in patients with coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions to prevent coronary artery disease (CAD) have been overshadowed by the effectiveness of drug treatments. This is particularly true in the context of secondary prevention, where the benefits of lipid-lowering, anticoagulant, and antihypertensive drugs have been emphasized in numerous studies. Lifestyle measures address multiple CHD risk factors simultaneously and are usually free from serious side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine whether a comprehensive lifestyle modification program could beneficially affect diet and exercise habits in addition to smoking cessation over two years. In addition, an attempt was made to evaluate whether this program could favorably affect the 5-year CHD risk in the male population included in the study. DESIGN: A total of 197 patients with established coronary artery disease were enrolled and randomized to a lifestyle intervention program or usual care. The follow-up examination took place after two years. METHODS: The intervention included a low-fat diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, psychosocial support, and education delivered by caregivers based on pharmacological and lifestyle interventions. The usual care included follow-up in the routine outpatient clinic. Both groups received the same comprehensive medication according to current guidelines. RESULTS: Patients in the lifestyle intervention group reduced saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol intake (P<0.001), increased exercise level (P<0.01), and quit smoking (P<0.05) in comparison to the group with the usual treatment. A sub-analysis of the impact of five-year risk of CHD in men revealed a relative risk reduction of 22% (95% CI 9-35). Although this result is significant, it must be interpreted with caution due to the low statistical power and reproducibility of the method. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of modern drug treatments for the prevention of secondary cardiovascular disease, it is still possible to demonstrate an additional reduction in the 5-year risk of CHD in men through favorable diet, exercise, and smoking cessation.",0,0,

1074,Influencing antibiotic prescribing through prescriber feedback and management guidelines: a 5-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: The extent of antibiotic use in upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) prompted a previous study of an educational intervention based on prescribing physician feedback and treatment guidelines. This study demonstrated a reduction in antibiotic prescribing for URTI and more appropriate antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. There are few long-term follow-up studies of educational programs of this type. OBJECTIVES: This follow-up study aimed to investigate whether the reduction in antibiotic prescribing observed in the intervention group of the original study persisted after 5 years and how prescribing behavior changed of GPs involved in the follow-up study differed from a large national survey of prescribing GPs. METHODS: Attempts were made to contact the 157 primary care physicians involved in the original study. Of these, 121 were in a general practice and are currently working there. Ninety-six agreed to participate, and of these, 79 completed a morbidity and treatment survey of 100 patient contacts (response rate 65.3%). RESULTS: The intervention group (n=37) maintained their pattern of antibiotic prescribing for URTI and antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis, with no significant change between the completion of the original study and the 5-year follow-up. The control group (n=42) showed a downward trend in prescribing antibiotics for URTI, with the effect that no significant differences between groups remained at the 5-year follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, both groups prescribed significantly fewer antibiotics for URTI and demonstrated greater adherence to prescribing guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis than participants in a large national primary care physician survey (n=984). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated maintenance of prescribing behavior in the intervention group over the long term. However, the changes in prescription observed in the control group and the power limitations of the study make it uncertain whether this was the result of a sustained effect of the educational intervention. The differences in both groups from the large national general practitioner survey suggest that other influences on prescription (eg participation in vocational training for general practitioners) also had an important influence.",0,0,
1075,Influencing antibiotic prescribing in general practice: an experiment with feedback from prescribers and management guidelines,"BACKGROUND: The extent of the use of antibiotics to treat upper respiratory tract infections in general practice is of concern due to the increasing problem of bacterial resistance. Effective educational strategies to promote rational prescribing are needed. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of prescribing feedback and treatment guidelines in reducing antibiotic prescribing by GP trainees in undifferentiated upper respiratory tract infections and in improving antibiotic choice in tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. The research tested a step-by-step approach to targeting educational inputs to high-prescribers. METHOD: New South Wales general practice trainees (n = 157) were randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 78) that received an educational intervention on antibiotic use or a control group (n = 79) that received an intervention unrelated topic. Trainees completed three practice activity surveys, each of 110 consecutive patient encounters, with 6-month intervals between surveys. Between surveys 1 and 2, written prescribing physician feedback and treatment guidelines on antibiotic use for URTI and antibiotic selection for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis were provided Prescribing rate of antibiotics for all indications, for URTI and prescribing of selected antibiotics for tonsillitis/ Streptococcal pharyngitis. RESULTS: Antibiotic prescription by the intervention group decreased three times from 25.0 to 23.3 to 19.7 per 100 URTI problems, while the control group decreased from 22.0 to 25.0 to 31.7 per 100 URTI problems increased (p=0.002). Prescribing in accordance with accepted guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis increased over time in the intervention group from 55.6 to 69.8 to 73.0 per 100 problems but decreased in the control group from 59.6 to 57, 5 to 58.5 (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Prescriber feedback and treatment guidelines have been shown to influence antibiotic prescribing for URTI and antibiotic choice for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. This study provides a model for targeting educational input to those prescribers who most urgently need to change their behavior.",0,0,
1076,Information technology for patient safety,"Background Research on patient care has identified significant disparities in the quality and safety of healthcare and the significant risks of iatrogenic harm as major issues. These deficiencies contribute to the high rates of potentially preventable morbidity and mortality and increasing healthcare expenditure in many healthcare systems. There have been significant developments in information technology over the past few decades, and there is now real potential to apply these technological developments to improve the delivery of healthcare more generally. The use of eHealth applications is of particular international interest. However, there is a large gap between the theoretical and empirically proven benefits of eHealth applications. While these applications are typically technically capable of assisting healthcare professionals, insufficient attention to the socio-technical dimensions of their use can lead to new avoidable risks for patients. Findings and Discussion Given the current lack of evidence on quality and safety improvements and cost-effectiveness associated with the deployment of eHealth applications, the focus should be on the implementation of more mature technologies"";"" It is also important that eHealth applications are evaluated against comprehensive and rigorous measures, ideally at all stages of their application life cycle.",0,1,
1077,Informed consent in clinical research at a general hospital in Mexico: investigators' opinions,"In Mexico, informed consent is a legal requirement that ensures patients invited to participate in clinical trials are given all the information they need to decide whether or not to participate in a research protocol. To improve our understanding of the issues faced by physicians in developing countries when obtaining informed consent (IC), we asked their opinion on the importance of IC in clinical research, the quantity and quality of information provided to the participant, and to the conditions in which the IC is obtained. The investigators felt that IC was useful to patients by providing information that helped the patient make a decision about his/her participation. Nevertheless, they felt that in relation to some aspects of the research, such as drug development in general, the use of placebos and the randomization process, many of the patients were not able to fully understand the information provided, reflecting the complexity of the Information and the complexity of information pointed to illiteracy as the main reason. Many investigators were unfamiliar with some of the guidelines set out in Mexico's General Health Law,(1) 36% of them admitted not having completed their IC letters.

1078,Informed consent for human experiments before the Nuremberg Code,"The issue of ethics relating to medical experimentation in Germany during the 1930s and 1940s was crucial at the Nuremberg trials and related trials of physicians and public health officials. Those involved in horrific crimes tried to excuse themselves by arguing that there were no explicit rules governing medical research involving humans in Germany at the time, and that research practice in Germany was no different from that in the allied countries . In this context, the Nuremberg Code of 1947 is generally considered to be the first document that established ethical rules for human experimentation based on informed consent. However, new research indicates that ethical issues of informed consent in human experimentation guidelines were recognized as early as the 19th century. These guidelines shed light on the still controversial question of when the concepts of autonomy, informed consent, and therapeutic and nontherapeutic research first emerged. This question gains renewed relevance in the context of current attempts to assess liability and responsibility for human abuse in various experiments conducted in the United States, Canada, Russia, and other nations since World War II.",0,0,
1079,Informed Consent: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,"Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is a well-documented procedure. Despite the increasing prevalence of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), surgical revascularization in patients with coronary artery disease will continue to play an important role. As demonstrated in previous clinical trials, physicians can provide important information to patients about risk-adjusted outcomes. A number of databases have been used to develop risk models to predict morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing CABG. Patients must choose between CABG and PCI based on the doctor's explanations. Larger studies have shown a clear survival benefit of CABG in patients at high risk of death from the disease itself, as defined by the severity of angina, the number of diseased vessels, and left ventricular function. However, it is not clear that patients always receive the correct information as to whether CABG or PCI is the more appropriate procedure.

1080,Informed shared decision making supported by decision coaches for women with ductal carcinoma in situ: study protocol for a randomized controlled cluster study,"BACKGROUND: Women with breast cancer want to be involved in treatment decisions. Guidelines have confirmed the right to informed codecision. However, previous research has shown that the implementation of informed decision making is suboptimal due to limited resources of physicians, power imbalances between patients and physicians, and a lack of evidence-based patient information. We have developed an informed shared decision-making program for women with primary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The program provides decision-making coaching for women through specialist nurses and aims to support participation in decision-making and informed decisions. This study evaluates the shared decision-making program in breast centers. METHODS/DESIGN: A cluster-randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare the informed shared decision-making program to standard of care. The program includes evidence-based patient decision support and training physicians (2 hours) and specialist breast and oncology nurses (4 days) in informed shared decision-making. Sixteen certified breast centers will be enrolled, with 192 women with primary DCIS being recruited. The primary outcome is the degree of patient participation in shared decision-making, as assessed by the MAPPIN odyad (Multifocal “sharing” approach to shared decision-making: observer-instrument dyad). Secondary endpoints include the submetrics of the MAPPIN inventory (MAPPIN-Onurse, MAPPIN-Ophysician, MAPPIN-Opatient, MAPPIN-Qnurse, MAPPIN-Qpatient, and MAPPIN-Qphysician), informed choice, decision conflict, and duration of encounters. It is expected that decision coaching and the provision of evidence-based decision support to patients will increase patient participation in decision-making with informed decisions and reduce decision conflicts and the length of doctor visits. In addition, an accompanying process evaluation is carried out. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the use of decision coaches in German breast centers.

1081,Quality Transformation Infrastructure: Measurement and Reporting in Veterans Administration Intensive Care Units,"Background Veterans Health Administration (VA) intensive care units (ICUs) are developing quality improvement infrastructure using information technology and executive recruitment. Method setting The participation of the 183 intensive care units in the quality improvement program is required. The infrastructure includes measurement (electronic data extraction, analysis), quarterly web-based reporting and support for the implementation of evidence-based practices. Managers prioritize actions based on quality improvement goals. The electronic extraction is manually validated against the medical record, selecting hospitals whose data items and measures are at the extremes (10th, 90th percentile). Results are presented in graphical, narrative, and tabular reports, graded by ICU type and complexity. Results The VA admits 103?689±1156 intensive care patients/year. Variances in electronic business practices, data storage location, and the normal range of some laboratory tests affect data quality. A data management website collects data elements that are critical to ICU performance and not available electronically. A dashboard manages the flood of data (the quarterly reports contain 106 to 299 pages). More than 85% of ICU managers and nurses review their reports. Leadership interest is maintained by including ICU goals in executive performance agreements, identifying local improvement opportunities with analytics software, and conducting targeted reviews. Conclusion Lessons relevant to non-VA institutions include: (1) need for ongoing data validation, (2) substantial leadership involvement at multiple levels, (3) supplementation of electronic data when key elements are missing, (4) benefit of a good , but imperfect electronic indicator to move practice while enhancing data items and (5) value of a dashboard.",0,0,
1082,Initiating quality improvement activities in psychiatric services,"In the public sector psychiatric setting, the responsibility for quality was often seen as the responsibility of the individual physician. This poses a particular challenge to adopting an organization-wide culture of quality improvement in this setting. Adopting a systemic view of quality may face resistance from individual clinicians who are unwilling to accept that some level of clinical autonomy should be incorporated into more standardized intervention and assessment patterns must be subsumed. Services must first address the issue of clinicians' willingness to embrace such a culture, which requires strong leadership leadership. The area of recently diagnosed psychosis was chosen as the starting point for initiating the quality improvement culture in a public sector psychiatric service. The ultimate outcome for the organization was a positive commitment to improvement, but the road has been long and hard. This paper describes the beginning of this ultimately rewarding journey.",0,0,
1083,Innovative strategy to implement guidelines for chronic heart failure among general practitioners in various healthcare facilities in Berlin,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to improve drug therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective interventional pilot study was conducted with a comparative cross-sectional analysis before and after the intervention. The usual pharmacotherapy was observed over a period of 8 months in two different outpatient care facilities in Berlin [11 general practitioners from general practitioner practices (IGP) and 12 doctors working in a medical care center (MVZ)]. Medical care centers offer a novel structure for outpatient care and were recently introduced in Germany. Subsequent intervention included implementation of heart failure guidelines via a computerized reminder system, followed by re-observation of prescribing behavior for 1 year. Primary care physicians recruited patients, assessed CHF severity according to NYHA class, and referred patients for echocardiography. The study included 190 patients in the baseline phase and 209 in the intervention phase. A longitudinal follow-up was performed in 172 cases. Echocardiography was ordered by 94.6% of MCC physicians and 79.9% of IGPs. Undermedication was observed in both settings. Guideline-compliant beta-blocker therapy was prescribed for 46.3% of patients (44.8% of IGPs and 48.5% of MCC-GPs). Prescribing improved by 12.3% after the procedure. There were clear deficiencies in the prescription of aldosterone antagonists (35%) in severe heart failure, which improved to 44.2% after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The problem of insufficient implementation of evidence-based therapy in CHF was partially overcome by the use of the reminder system, which provided brief guideline recommendations to participating physicians during the intervention phase.",0,0,

Aim To determine the effects of computer-aided standing orders from doctors compared to reminders from doctors on inpatient vaccination rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Randomized study of 3,777 general practitioner patients discharged from 1 of 6 study wards during a 14-month period (November 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999) consisting of 2 overlapping influenza seasons at a municipal public teaching hospital . Interventions The hospital's computerized physician order entry system identified inpatients eligible for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. For patients with standing orders, the system automatically created vaccination orders addressed to the nursing staff at the time the patient was discharged. For patients with memories, the computer system provided reminders to physicians containing vaccine prescriptions during routine prescription entry sessions. Main Outcome Measure Vaccine administration. Results During the approximately 6-month influenza season, 50% of all hospitalized patients were considered eligible for influenza vaccination. Twenty-two percent of patients hospitalized throughout the 14 months of the study were eligible for pneumococcal vaccination. Patients with a standing order received an influenza vaccination significantly more often (42%) than patients with a reminder (30%) (p<0.001). Patients with a standing order received a pneumococcal vaccination significantly more frequently (51%) than patients with a reminder function (31%) (p < 0.001). Conclusions Computerized standing orders were more effective than computerized reminders in increasing both influenza and pneumococcal vaccine delivery. Our results suggest that computerized standing orders should be used more extensively for this purpose.",1,1,

1086,Integrated Guide to Treating Familial Hypercholesterolaemia from the International FH Foundation,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited condition present from birth that markedly increases plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and causes premature coronary artery disease. There are at least 20 million people with FH worldwide, but the majority go undetected and current treatment is often suboptimal. To close this major gap in coronary prevention, we present consensus-based guidelines for the treatment of FH from an international perspective. The guidelines were generated from seminars and workshops held at an international symposium. The recommendations focus on the detection, diagnosis, assessment and treatment of FH in adults and children and establish guidelines for clinical use. They also refer to best practices for cascade screening and risk notification and testing of families for FH, including the use of genetic testing. Treatment guidelines are based on risk stratification, management of risk factors other than cholesterol, and safe and effective use of LDL-lowering therapies. Recommendations for lipoprotein apheresis are given. The use of new therapies for FH is also suggested. This international guideline recognizes gaps in evidence, but aims to make best use of current practice and technology to achieve the best outcomes for the treatment of FH. It should be used accordingly to support clinical judgment and adapted to country and local health needs and resources.",0,0,
1087,Integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy for people with psychosis and comorbid substance abuse: randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy in addition to standard care for patients with psychosis and a comorbid substance use problem. DESIGN Two-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. RECRUITMENT Secondary care in the UK. PARTICIPANTS 327 patients with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a diagnosis of dependence or abuse of drugs, alcohol, or both, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. INTERVENTION The intervention consisted of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy plus standard of care compared to standard of care alone. Phase one of therapy - ""Motivational Building"" - is concerned with engaging the patient and then exploring and resolving the ambivalence to changing substance use. Phase two - ""Action"" - supports and facilitates change through cognitive behavioral approaches. Up to 26 therapy sessions were conducted over a year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was death from any cause or hospitalization during the 12 months following completion of therapy. Secondary endpoints were frequency and amount of substance use (assessed using the timeline followback method), willingness to change, perceived adverse consequences of use, psychotic symptom ratings, number and duration of relapses, and global ratings of functioning and intentional self-harm at age 12 and 24 months, with additional timeline follow-up assessments at 6 and 18 months. Analysis was by treatment intent and robust estimates of treatment effect were generated. RESULTS 327 participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=164) or usual care (n=163). At 24 months, 326 (99.7%) were evaluated for the primary endpoint and 246 (75.2%) for the key secondary endpoints. Treatment had no beneficial effect on hospitalizations or deaths during follow-up, with 23.3% (38/163) of the therapy group and 20.2% (33/163) of the control group dying or being admitted (adjusted odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval). 0.68 to 1.99""; p = 0.579). Therapy had no effect on frequency of substance use or perceived negative consequences of abuse, but had a statistically significant effect on the amount used per day of substance use ( adjusted ORs for major compound 1.50, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.09, p=0.016 and all compounds 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05, p=0.017), 1.26 to 3 .31; p=0.004) which was not maintained at 24 months (0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28; p=0.320) There was no effect of treatment on clinical outcomes such as relapses, psychotic symptoms , functioning, and self-harm.CONCLUSIONS:Integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral therapy for people with psychosis and substance abuse do not improve hospitalization outcome, symptom scores, or functioning.This approach reduces the amount of substance used for at least one year after A end of therapy.

1088,Integrating Back to Sleep recommendations into practice in the NICU,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that NICUs should support and model risk reduction recommendations for sudden infant death syndrome well in advance of the infant's expected discharge. Medical staff are important role models for parents, and the way they position infants in the hospital greatly influences parenting practices at home. The goals of this project were to increase the percentage of infants who follow safe sleep practices in the NICU prior to discharge and to determine whether improved adherence to these practices would affect parental behavior at home. METHODS: An algorithm detailing when to start safe sleep practices, a back to sleep crèche card, educational programs for nurses and parents, a crèche audit tool, and post-discharge phone reminders were developed as quality improvement intervention strategies . RESULTS: Compliance in the NICU for the supine position increased from 39% to 83% (p<0.001), provision of a firm sleeping surface increased from 5% to 96% (p<0.001), and removal of soft objects from the bed increased from 45% % improved to 75% (p=0.001). A post-discharge telephone survey found that parental compliance with safe sleep practices improved from 23% to 82% (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial interventions improved adherence to safe sleep practices in the NICU and at home.",0,1,
1089,Integrating Addiction Treatment into Primary Care with Mobile Health Technology: Protocol for an Implementation Research Study,"Background Health care reform in the United States is encouraging federally qualified health centers and other primary care practices to integrate treatment for addiction and other behavioral health problems into their practices. The potential of mobile health technologies to treat addiction and co-morbidities such as HIV in these settings is significant but largely untested. This paper describes a protocol to evaluate the implementation of an integrated e-health communication technology delivered through mobile phones called Seva in primary care settings. Seva is an evidence-based system for addiction treatment and recovery support for patients and real-time case count monitoring for physicians. Methods/Design Our implementation strategy uses three models of organizational change: the program planning model to foster adoption and sustainability, the NIATx quality improvement model to create a welcoming environment for change, and Rogers' dissemination of innovation research, which facilitates adaptations of innovations to maximize their potential for adoption. We will implement Seva and conduct an intensive mixed-method assessment at three different Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers in the United States. Our non-concurrent, multiple baseline design includes three periods—pretest (ending in four months of pre-implementation), active Seva implementation, and maintenance—with implementation staggered across sites at six-month intervals. The first location will serve as a pilot clinic. We will track the timing of intervention elements and assess study outcomes within each dimension of the outreach, efficacy, adoption, implementation and maintenance framework, including impact on clinicians, patients and practices. Our mixed-methods approach includes quantitative (e.g. interrupted time-series analysis of treatment visits, with clinics as the unit of analysis) and qualitative (e.g. staff interviews regarding adjustments to the implementation protocol) methods as well as assessment of implementation costs. Discussion If implementation is successful, the field will have proven technology to support federally recognized health centers and affiliated organizations in delivering addiction treatment and recovery support, and a proven strategy for implementing the technology. Seva also has the potential to improve core elements of addiction treatment such as referral and treatment processes. Mobile addiction treatment technology and an accompanying implementation model could provide a cost-effective means to improve the lives of patients with drug and alcohol problems.",0,0,
1090,Integrating evidence on patient preferences into health policy decisions: Protocol of the patient VIP study,"Background Despite a strong movement towards active patient participation in health policy decisions, systematic and explicit consideration of the evidence from this research on patient preferences seems limited. In addition, little is known about the opinions of several stakeholders on the inclusion of research on patient preferences in health policy decisions. This paper describes the protocol for an exploratory study to integrate research on patient preferences into health policy decisions. The study asks: to what extent research evidence on patient preferences is taken into account in current processes for health policy decisions; stakeholder views on integrating this type of evidence into health policy decisions; and what a decision-making framework could be for integrating such research evidence into health policy decisions Methods/design The study is divided into three sub-studies, predominantly using qualitative methods: The first sub-study is a scoping review in five European countries to examine whether and how results of research on patient preferences are taken into account in current procedures for coverage decisions and in the development of guidelines for clinical practice Netherlands The third sub-study is the development of a decision framework for research on patient preferences. The framework consists of: a process description regarding the place of evidence of patient preferences in the decision-making process, a taxonomy describing various terminologies and conceptualizations of “preferences”, and an overview of existing methods of investigating preferences. The conceptual framework will be presented to and discussed with experts Discussion This study aims to raise awareness of the existence and potential value of research on patient preferences for health policy decisions, and to provide insight into the methods used to study patient preferences. Barriers and facilitators for the integration of such research into health policy decisions Guidelines for clinical practice, healthcare decision makers and patient advocates.",0,0,
1091,Integrative medicine in specialist training: competence development through online curriculum training,"INTRODUCTION: The Integrative Medicine in Residency (IMR) program, a 200-hour web-based collaborative education initiative, has been implemented in 8 primary care residency programs and has demonstrated potential as a national model for integrating training in integrative/complementary/alternative medicine in medical education. INTERVENTION: The curriculum content was developed based on a needs analysis and a set of graduate medical education competencies developed in accordance with the Accreditation Council's Graduate Medical Education Accreditation Council Outcome Project Guidelines. Content was delivered through distributed online learning and included on-site activities. A modular format allowed flexible implementation in different living environments. ASSESSMENT: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE CURRICULUM, A MULTIMODAL ASSESSMENT WAS USED, INCLUDING: (1) the residents' assessment of the curriculum; (2) residents' competency assessments through tests of medical knowledge, self-assessment, direct observations, and reflections;"" and (3) residents' well-being and well-being through behavioral assessments. RESULTS: The 2011 cohort (n = 61) had a high completion rate in the first and second year (98.7% and 84.2%, respectively), and course assessments for achievement of objectives, clinical utility, and how the technology works were highly rated. courses, there was a statistically significant improvement in medical knowledge test scores for content-matched questions CONCLUSIONS: The IMR program is a step forward in the national effort to provide physicians with broad education in integrative medicine a success in terms of online education The evaluation suggests that this program is feasible to implement and despite the many burdens of h the stay is acceptable for the residents.",0,0,
1092,Intensive investigation in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease,"Ninety-eight patients with clinically localized Hodgkin's disease underwent laparotomy and splenectomy to determine the extent of microscopic spread. 68 patients underwent the procedure for untreated disease that was evidently confined above the diaphragm. Abdominal disease cannot be ruled out with certainty based on noninvasive examination at presentation. Clinical assessment of spleen disease was unreliable unless gross splenomegaly was present. Pedal lymphography was accurate in assessing para-aortic and iliac disease but of no value in assessing other intra-abdominal lymph node involvement, including that of the mesenteric lymph node. Trephine bone marrow biopsy findings were normal in all patients before surgery, and only one patient was found to have diseased bone marrow by Stryker-Saw biopsy at surgery. Liver disease was identified at surgery in nine patients, some of whom were asymptomatic with clinically undetectable spleen and lymph node disease. In one-third of patients who underwent laparotomy, detailed clinical staging failed to detect the disease. These studies demonstrate that if radiotherapy is to remain the treatment of choice for diseases truly localized to lymph nodes, a detailed staging procedure, including laparotomy and splenectomy, remains essential. The value of this potentially curative treatment is significantly diminished in the under-staged patient.",0,0,

1094,Statin intentions and prescribing: Can the theory of planned behavior explain physician behavior in the following guideline recommendations?,"OBJECTIVES: Few studies have examined the usefulness of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in explaining physician behavior. This study uses the TPB to explain physicians' implementation of guideline prescribing recommendations. METHODS: We developed the questionnaire by conducting qualitative interviews and a pilot study. A random sample of 155 general practitioners (GPs) in England took part in the study. Prescribing and practice data were collected from routine sources. We analyzed the data using regression methods. RESULTS: TPB explained 48% of the discrepancies in reported intentions to follow guideline prescribing recommendations. Attitudes and perceived controls, but not subjective norms, were predictors of intention variation. TPB belief variables significantly explained the variation in effective and efficient prescribing indicators (14% and 12%, respectively). Normative, control, and behavioral beliefs contributed to the models. Only for efficient prescribing did the TPB items retain their meaning in the presence of demographic variables. We found no significant relationship between intent and prescription. CONCLUSIONS: TPB contributed to understanding the prescribing behavior of general practitioners and their intentions to implement a clinical guideline. Beliefs (eg, normative beliefs) were better predictors of behavior than the composite scores for their corresponding higher-level construct (eg, indirect subjective norm). TPB models should be tested alongside randomized trials to test the causality assumption that a change in beliefs ultimately leads to a change in behavior.",0,0,
1095,Interactions between pharmaceutical representatives and physicians in training. A thematic review,"AIM: Medical studies and specialist training are formative years for the establishment of prescription models. Our aim was to review the literature on the extent of pharmaceutical industry contact with trainees, attitudes towards these interactions and implications for trainee prescribing behaviour, with a focus on potential points of intervention and policy making. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE for English language articles from 1966 to May 2004. All original articles were included if the abstract reported content relevant to medical education and the pharmaceutical industry. Editorials, guidelines and policy recommendations were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND KEY RESULTS: Contact with pharmaceutical representatives was common among residents. The majority of trainees found the interactions appropriate. A minority believed that their own prescribing could be affected by contact or gifts, but more likely believed that others' prescribing could be affected. Prescribing by the resident was associated with visits from pharmaceutical representatives and the availability of samples. A variety of policy and educational interventions appear to influence residents' attitudes towards interactions with industry, although data on the long-term effects of these interventions are limited. Overall, residents reported insufficient training in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical industry is strongly represented during residency training, has gained general acceptance among trainees, and appears to influence prescribing behavior. Training programs can benefit from policies and curricula that teach residents about the influence of the industry and ways to critically evaluate the information given to them. Recommendations for local and national approaches are discussed.",0,0,
1096,Interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry: what does the literature say?,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of three types of interactions between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry—corporate-funded clinical trials, corporate-funded continuing medical education (CME), and information for physicians provided by pharmaceutical detailers—on the direction and quality of clinical trials, content of CME courses and the prescribing behavior of physicians. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and HEALTH search English-language articles published from 1978 to 1993, supplemented with material from the author's personal collection. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 227 articles from the MEDLINE and HEALTH searches and approximately 2000 articles from the author's library were initially reviewed. The following selection criteria were used: studies conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain and the United States; studies conducted after 1977; quantitative surveys with details of the survey methods; Studies on the direction and quality of company-funded clinical trials and the content of CME courses, specifying explicit criteria used in the assessment;” and reports on the results of interactions, indicating how the results were assessed. 36 studies met these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was extracted on five topics: physician attitudes toward drug industry interactions, frequency of physician participation in the interactions, orientation and quality of company-sponsored clinical trials, content of company-sponsored CME courses, and changes in physician prescribing behavior as result of an interaction. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although most physicians participate in company-sponsored clinical trials only occasionally, most turn to detailers and attend company-sponsored CME courses. However, physicians do not have a very high opinion of information from detailers or from corporate-sponsored CME events. Many physicians view pharmaceutical companies as an important source of funding for clinical trials, but also have reservations about accepting funds from this source. Company funding of clinical trials may affect the quality of the trials and the type of research physicians conduct. Company-sponsored CME courses may have a commercial orientation, even if conducted under policies designed to ensure the independence of the event. All three types of interactions influence physicians' prescribing behavior, and in the case of information gathering by detailers, the interaction makes physicians' prescribing practices less appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are affected by their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. In most cases, more research is needed to determine whether such interactions result in more or less appropriate prescribing practices. The CMA's guidelines on this topic should be evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling physician-industry interactions. Further action may be necessary if the guidelines do not prevent adverse effects on prescribing practice.",0,0,
1097,Interdisciplinary perspectives on management of the restless baby: key strategies for improved outcomes,"The aim of this study was to analyze the perspectives of key informants with clinical expertise in the care of restless infants and their families with respect to changes needed to improve outcomes. The research used a targeted selection strategy and a thematic analysis of interviews with key informants from 24 health professionals from 11 disciplines. The informants were chosen because of their extensive experience in dealing with distressed babies and their families. Participants confirmed existing evidence that postpartum care is fragmented in Australia. All agreed that, first, early intervention in primary care for distressed infants and their families, and second, improved interprofessional communication are essential if the burden of this problem on infants, families and the healthcare system is to be minimized. Third, there was consensus that there are significant gaps in the knowledge base and managerial behavior of health professionals. The development of educational resources, best practice guidelines, common assessment frameworks for primary care physicians, and strategies for improved interprofessional communication are necessary to improve health outcomes and reduce the burden of this common but complex postpartum problem.",0,0,
1098,Internal and external validity of cluster-randomized trials: systematic review of current trials,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate aspects of the internal validity of recently published randomized cluster studies and explore the reporting of information useful for evaluating the external validity of these studies. DESIGN Review of 34 cluster-randomized trials in primary care published in 2004 and 2005 in seven peer-reviewed journals (British Medical Journal, British Journal of General Practice, Family Practice, Preventive Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of General Internal Medicine, pediatrics). DATA SOURCES National Library of Medicine (Medline) via PubMed. DATA EXTRACTION To assess aspects of internal validity, we extracted data on the adequacy of sample size calculations and analysis, methods of identifying and recruiting individual participants, and blinding. To examine the reporting of information useful for assessing external validity, we extracted data on cluster suitability, cluster inclusion and retention, cluster generalizability, and intervention feasibility and acceptability for clustered healthcare providers. RESULTS Twenty-one (62%) of the studies resulted in clustering in the sample size calculations and 30 (88%) in the analysis, ""about a quarter were potentially biased due to patient recruitment and identification procedures;"" In 19 (56%) of individual participants, assignment status was blinded, and 15 (44%) had outcome raters blinded. Almost half of the reports reported insufficient information on the generalizability of clusters, and two-fifths lacked information on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Cluster-randomized trials are essential for evaluating certain types of interventions. Issues affecting their internal validity, such as B. Appropriate calculations and analysis of sample size, became widespread and are now better addressed by researchers. Blinding of those who identify and recruit patients is recommended but not always done. In studies that do not recruit individual participants, there may be fewer barriers to internal validity. External validity appears to be neglected in many studies, but is arguably just as important as internal validity when assessing quality as a basis for medical intervention.",0,0,

ICRA Working Group on Multilingual Language Tests,"AIM: To provide guidelines for the development of two types of closed-loop language perception tests that can be applied and interpreted in the same way in all languages. The guidelines cover the digit triple and matrix set tests most commonly used to test speech recognition in noise. They were developed by a working group on multilingual language assessments of the International Collegium of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA). DESIGN: The recommendations are based on reviews of existing evaluations of the digit triple and matrix tests and on the research experience of members of the ICRA working group. They represent the result of a consensus process. RESULTS: The resulting recommendations cover: test design and word selection; speaker characteristics; audio recording and stimulus preparation; noise masking; Test Execution;' and Test Validation. CONCLUSIONS: By following these guidelines for developing new tests of this type, clinicians and researchers working in any language can create tests whose results can be compared and combined in cross-language studies.",0,0,
1100,Intervention in infancy: implications for autism spectrum disorders,"There is a paucity of empirically validated treatments for infants and young children under 3 years of age with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as a paucity of empirical research on successful intervention characteristics for this population. However, early screening efforts focus on identifying the risk of autism in children younger than 3 years of age. In order to build ASD interventions for infants and young children on a foundation of evidence-based characteristics, the present paper presents the results of a systematic literature review and effect size analysis of effective interventions for infants and young children with other developmental disabilities: those who were born preterm, have developmental disabilities, or are at high risk for developmental disabilities due to the presence of a biological or familial condition associated with developmental disabilities. A review of 32 controlled, high-quality experimental studies found that the most effective interventions routinely used a combination of four specific intervention procedures, including (1) parental involvement in the intervention, including ongoing parent coaching that focuses on both parental responsiveness and also child-sensitive cues and teaching families to provide the infant interventions, (2) individualization to each infant's developmental profile, (3) focus on a broad rather than a narrow range of learning goals, and (4) temporal characteristics , which start as early as the risk is detected and ensure a greater intensity and duration of the intervention. These four characteristics of effective interventions for infants and young children with other developmental disabilities likely provide a solid foundation upon which researchers and clinicians can build effective interventions for infants and young children at risk of or affected by ASD.",0,0,
1101,Intervention development to integrate conventional tobacco cessation interventions into routine CAM practice,"BACKGROUND: Practitioners of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies are an important and growing presence in healthcare systems worldwide. A key question is whether evidence-based behavior change interventions routinely used in conventional health care could also be incorporated into CAM practice to address public health priorities. Critical to successful integration are intervention approaches that are considered acceptable and consistent with the practice patterns and treatment approaches of different types of CAM practitioners—that is, they have context validity. The development of interventions to ensure contextual validity was an integral part of the CAM Reach (CAMR) project, a project investigating the public health potential of tobacco cessation training for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists (CAM practitioners). This paper describes formative research conducted to achieve this goal. METHODS: The intervention development, conducted in three CAM disciplines (chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy), consisted of six iterative steps: 1) exploratory interviews with key informants; 2) local survey of CAM practitioners; 3) Demonstration of existing tobacco cessation curriculum with CAM practitioner 4) Adaptation/tailoring of existing curriculum 5) External review of adaptations 6) Provision of tailored curriculum to CAM practitioners followed by curriculum evaluation RESULTS: CAM practitioners identified barriers and promoters to tobacco use engage with patients/clients and saw the relevance and acceptability of the intervention content The intervention development process was attentive to their real-world intervention concerns Extensive intervention customization to the context of each CAM discipline was deemed unnecessary Participants and practitioners from all CAM disciplines embraced the training content, as they saw fit, to have broad relevance and application throughout the three CAM disciplines. All findings informed the final intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The participatory and iterative formative research process resulted in an intervention with contextual validity in real-world CAM practices as it: 1) is patient/client centered and emphasizes the practitioner's role in a healing relationship; 2) responds to the different contexts of CAM practitioners' work and patient-client relationships; 3) incorporates relevant best practices from the US Public Health Service's Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Tobacco Addiction;"" and 4) is appropriate for the breadth of healing philosophies, application areas, and practice patterns found among participating CAM practitioners. The full CAMR study to evaluate the impact of CAMR intervention on the clinical behavior of CAM practitioners is ongoing.",0,0,
1102,Intervention for autistic spectrum disorders,"comprehensive approach to assessing each child with autism must be specific to each individual child and family. This premise applies to medical therapies and special educational services as well as to psychopharmacological interventions. Behavioral, as opposed to pharmacological, treatment is the hallmark of an effective intervention in autism. Physicians who care for children with autism must familiarize themselves with the child-rearing laws and recommendations for intervention. Goals should include improved functional verbal and nonverbal communication and social skills, increased engagement in developmentally appropriate activities, improved fine and gross motor skills, and the development of independent academic and organizational skills, and the replacement of problem behaviors with developmentally appropriate behaviors. Treating children with autism is difficult but often necessary for chronic behavioral disorders. In the absence of clear and up-to-date guidelines, we have attempted to propose an algorithm based on symptom clusters based on evidence and clinical experience. Although children with autism respond to lower doses of medication and are more prone to side effects than other children, medical intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for the child and their family. Careful thought leading to the correct identification of target behaviors can adequately guide better alternatives to drugs. Although these approaches are costly and time-consuming endeavors, spending on such efforts is the only avenue available to improve potential outcomes for individuals with autism and lower the societal cost of living for each individual.",0,0,
1103,Intervention mapping to develop a strategy for implementing insurance medical guidelines for depression,"BACKGROUND: This article describes the development of a strategy to implement the insurance medical guidelines for depression. The application of the guidelines should lead to a more transparent and uniform assessment of applicants with depressive symptoms. METHODS: The implementation strategy was developed using the Intervention Mapping (IM) method to align with insurance medical practice. The behavior explanation model ASE (Attitude, Social Influence and Self-Efficacy) served as the theoretical basis for the development work. A literature study on implementation strategies and interviews with panel doctors were carried out in order to develop instruments for dealing with the guideline. These instruments have been tailored to the needs and working conditions of insurance doctors. Performance indicators to measure the quality of the assessment and adherence to the guidelines were defined with contributions from insurance doctors. RESULTS: This study led to the development of a training course to train insurance physicians in the application of the guidelines for depression using the above tools. The effectiveness of this training course will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Conclusions: The use of IM enabled the development of guideline support tools tailored to insurance medical practice.",0,0,
1104,Interventions by health professionals providing routine child health care to reduce tobacco smoke exposure in children: A review and meta-analysis,"IMPORTANT: Reducing exposure to tobacco smoke in children is a public health priority. Guidelines recommend that health professionals in child health settings should address exposure to tobacco smoke (TSE) in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of interventions performed by healthcare professionals providing routine child health care in reducing TSEs in children. DATA SOURCES: A secondary analysis of 57 studies included in a 2014 Cochrane review followed by an expanded search was performed. Controlled trials (published up to June 2015) of interventions focused on reducing TSEs in children were identified, with no restrictions on who performed the interventions. Secondary data extraction was performed in August 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled studies of routine child health care conducted by health professionals (physicians, nurses, medical assistants, health educators, and nutritionists) that addressed the outcomes of interest (TSE reduction in children and parental smoking behavior) were eligible for inclusion in this review and the meta-analysis to be included. Data extraction and synthesis: Study details and quality characteristics were independently extracted by 2 authors. When outcome measures were sufficiently similar, a meta-analysis was performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Otherwise, the results were described narratively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the reduction of TSEs in children. Secondary endpoints of interest were parental smoking cessation, parental smoking reduction, and maternal postpartum smoking relapse prevention. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the selection criteria. The narrative analysis of the 6 studies that measured TSE in children did not show any intervention effects compared to comparison groups. Similarly, the meta-analysis of 9 studies that measured parental smoking cessation showed no overall intervention effect (n=6399) (hazard ratio, 1.05 in; 95% CI, 0.74–1.50; p=0.78 ). Meta-analysis of the 3 studies that measured maternal smoking relapse prevention after delivery showed a significant overall intervention effect (n=1293) (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.14; P=0.01). A high degree of study heterogeneity likely resulted from variability in outcome measures, length of follow-up, intervention strategies, and unknown intervention adherence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Interventions delivered by health professionals who provide routine child health care can be effective in preventing maternal smoking relapse. More research is needed to improve the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing TSEs in children and increasing parental smoking cessation. The results of this meta-analysis have implications for policy and practice regarding interventions by routine pediatric health workers aimed at reducing children's exposure to tobacco smoke.",0,0,
1105,Interventions for adolescent depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents is underdiagnosed and undertreated despite its poor long-term outcomes, including suicide risk. Primary care settings can be critical sites for the detection of depression, but little information is available about the usefulness of primary care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We sought to review the evidence for treating depression in primary care, focusing on evidence on psychosocial, educational, and/or supportive intervention strategies. METHODS: Available data on brief psychosocial treatments for adolescent depression in primary settings were reviewed. Given the lack of direct studies, we also consulted relevant literature to summarize the available evidence on whether brief psychosocial support from a member of the primary care team, with or without medication, could improve depression outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 37 relevant studies on the treatment of depression in adolescents in primary care. Only 4 studies directly examined the effects of psychosocial interventions in primary care for adolescent depression, but they suggest that such interventions can be effective. Indirect evidence from other psychosocial/behavioural interventions, including predictive guidance and efforts to improve therapy adherence, and adult depression studies also demonstrates the benefit of interventions in primary care and the impact of provider training to improve psychosocial skills. CONCLUSIONS: There is potential for successful treatment of depression in adolescents in primary care given the evidence that brief psychosocial support, with or without medication, improves a range of outcomes, including adolescent depression itself.

Numerous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients at risk of VTE is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Despite this, prophylactic therapies for VTE are underused. System-wide interventions may be more effective in improving the use of VTE prophylaxis than relying on individual provider prescribing behavior. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of interventions to increase thromboprophylaxis in adult hospitalized medical and surgical patients at risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), assessed in terms of: 1. Increasing the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis and adequate prophylaxis 2. Reducing the risk of symptomatic VTE3. Reducing the risk of asymptomatic VTE4. safety of the intervention. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Coordinator (TSC) searched the group's Specialized Register (last search July 2010) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library) 2010 Issue 3. We searched the Databases PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS (April 19, 2010) as well as the reference lists of relevant review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all studies whose interventions aimed to increase the use of prophylaxis and/or appropriate prophylaxis, reduce the rate of symptomatic VTE, or reduce the rate of asymptomatic VTE in adult hospitalized patients. We excluded studies that merely disseminated published guidelines and studies whose interventions were not clearly described. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We collected the following endpoints: proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis (RP), proportion of patients receiving adequate prophylaxis (RAP) (primary endpoints), and occurrence of symptomatic VTE, asymptomatic VTE and safety consequences such as bleeding. We categorized interventions into Education, Warnings, and Multifaceted Interventions. We meta-analyzed RCTs and non-randomized studies (NRS) separately by random effects meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic and subgroup analyses. Before analyzing, we decided that if three or more studies were available for a given intervention, the results would be pooled. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and a cumulative meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included a total of 55 studies. One of these reported data in patient days and could not be analyzed quantitatively with the others. The 54 remaining studies (8 RCTs and 46 NRS) eligible for inclusion in our quantitative synthesis included a total of 78,343 participants. There was enough data among the RCTs to pool the results for a primary endpoint (prophylaxis received) for the ""Warn"" intervention. Alerts, such as computer-based reminders or stickers on patient charts, were associated with a risk difference (RD) of 13%, indicating an increase in the proportion of patients receiving prophylaxis (95% confidence interval (CI) 1% to 25%). There was enough data among the NRS to pool both primary endpoints for each type of intervention. The pooled risk differences for received prophylaxis ranged from 8% to 17% and for received adequate prophylaxis from 11% to 19%. Education and warnings were associated with a statistically significant increase in the prescription of appropriate prophylaxis, and multifaceted interventions were associated with a statistically significant increase in the prescription of any prophylaxis and appropriate prophylaxis. Multifaceted interventions had the largest pooled effects. The results of I(2) showed significant statistical heterogeneity, which was partially explained by patient types and hospital type. A subgroup analysis showed that multifaceted interventions that included an alert may be more effective in improving prophylaxis rates and appropriate prophylaxis than those without an alert. The results for VTE and safety outcomes showed no significant benefit or harm, although most studies were underpowered to assess these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed a large number of studies that implemented a variety of system-wide strategies aimed at improving thromboprophylaxis rates in many settings and patient populations. We found statistically significant improvements in prescribing warning-related prophylaxis (RCTs) and multifaceted interventions (RCTs and NRS), and improvements in prescribing appropriate prophylaxis in NRS through the use of education, warnings, and multifaceted interventions. Multifaceted interventions with a warning component can be most effective. Proven sources of heterogeneity included patient types and hospital type. The results of our review will help physicians, nurses, pharmacists, hospital administrators and policy makers make practical decisions about the local adoption of specific system-wide interventions to improve the prevention of VTE, an important public health issue. We found no significant benefit in VTE outcomes"";"" however, previous RCTs assessing the effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis and targeting these endpoints have demonstrated the benefit of prophylactic therapies and a favorable benefit versus increased risk of bleeding events.",0,1,
1107,Interventions to increase patients' trust in physicians and physician groups,"BACKGROUND: Trust is a fundamental component of the patient-physician relationship and is associated with increased satisfaction, adherence to therapy, and continuity of care. It is not clear whether there are measures that are known to be effective in increasing patients' trust in doctors. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of interventions aimed at enhancing a patient's trust in the physician or group of physicians. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to Week 4 2003), EMBASE (1985 to July 2003), Health Star (1975 to July 2004), PsycINFO (1967) . to July 2004), CINAHL (1982 to June 2003), LILACS (1982 to April 2003), African Trials Register (1948 to April 2003), African Health Anthology (1924 to April 2003), Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to April 2003) and the bibliographies of the studies evaluated for inclusion. We also searched the bibliographies of studies evaluated for inclusion and contacted researchers working in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time-series studies of interventions (informational, educational, behavioral, organizational) targeted at physicians or patients (or caregivers) in whom trust as a primary or secondary result was assessed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Three RCTs, all published in English and set in North American primary care and involving 1916 participants, were included. There was significant heterogeneity in terms of objectives, format, and content of the interventions. A study of a training intervention for primary care physicians to improve communication behavior (20 physicians evaluated by 414 patients) showed no effect on trust. The other two interventions were patient-centered. One examined the effects on trust when incentives to physicians in a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) were disclosed to patients (n=918) and showed no loss of trust. Another examined the effect of induction visits on new HMO members' (n=564) confidence in their HMO physicians. Confidence in physicians increased compared to control group after visit for one type of introductory visit, group visit (confidence out of 10 (standard deviation (SD))) was 8.8 (1.5) and 7.1 (2.2) , difference 1.7 (95% confidence). Interval 1.22 to 2.18)). However, there were many dropouts and the analysis did not correspond to the treatment intention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention can increase or decrease trust in physicians. Further studies are needed to examine the impact of policy changes, guidelines, and specific physician training on patient confidence.",0,0,
1108,Interventions for migraine prophylaxis: protocol of a systematic umbrella review and network meta-analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Several interventions are effective for migraine prophylaxis. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is not yet clear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarize the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attacks. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct an overall systematic review to identify appropriate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the recommended migraine prophylaxis interventions according to the guidelines. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews searched for RCTs. We describe the RCTs' general information for participants, interventions, outcome measures, comparisons, and the primary outcomes. In addition, a network meta-analysis will be performed to determine the comparative efficacy of the treatments using a random effects model. The absolute and relative effectiveness of the treatments is reported. Heterogeneity and inconsistency between studies is assessed by the Cochrane statistical test I(2) and Q-test. The risk of bias is assessed and the overall strength of evidence is summarized. DISCUSSION: The outcome of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence for treatments for migraine prevention and potentially provide a ranking of treatments for patients and clinicians to help them select the best option.

1110,Interventions to change the behavior of midwifery health professionals to promote weight-related support for obese pregnant women: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: In the last five years, the publication of guidelines on the management of obesity and weight gain during pregnancy has increased significantly. Health professionals have identified several barriers to this area of practice, including the need to improve their communication skills, the belief that pregnant women have negative reactions to discussions about weight, and a lack of knowledge about weight management. This systematic review aimed to identify: the effectiveness of interventions to change the practice of health professionals in relation to maternal obesity or weight management during pregnancy"";"" and what behavior change techniques and modes of intervention delivery have been used in interventions to date. RESULTS: The search strategy included searching electronic databases, study registers, and citation searches. Inclusion criteria were intervention studies aimed at changing the practice of healthcare professionals related to maternal obesity or weight management. The search identified 3,608 studies. However, no suitable completed studies were identified. One registered Canadian randomized controlled trial was identified. The study includes an educational intervention for primary care physicians to support compliance with guidelines on weight gain in pregnancy. The study had not started yet, so no efficacy data were available. CONCLUSIONS: The current focus of research on maternal obesity and weight control is aimed at changing behavior in pregnant women. These interventions do not address the barriers faced by many health professionals regarding maternal obesity and weight management practice. Further research is needed to identify the most effective approaches to assist healthcare professionals in implementing maternal obesity policies and weight management in practice.",0,0,
1111,Interventions to improve follow-up care for abnormal findings in cancer screening,"The potential reduction in morbidity and mortality from cancer screening cannot be realized without adequate follow-up for abnormalities identified during screening. In this article, the authors critically review the existing literature on correlates of receiving appropriate follow-up for abnormalities detected by screening, as well as the literature on interventions aimed at increasing rates of follow-up. Lessons Learned describe what is known and what is not known about factors associated with or predicting follow-up utilization. Effective interventions to improve aftercare are also described and gaps identified. A conceptual model is developed that divides the healthcare system in the United States into four tiers: policy, practice, provider, and patient. Some patient-level factors influencing the receipt of follow-up care are identified, but the lack of data severely limits understanding of provider-, practice-, and policy-level correlations. The majority of intervention studies to increase follow-up have focused on patient-level factors and have performed targeted follow-up for abnormal Papanicolaou smears. Insufficient information is available on the effectiveness of interventions at the provider, practice, or policy level. There is a lack of standard definitions of what constitutes appropriate aftercare, which severely limits the comparability of study results. The validity of different methods of obtaining outcome data has not been clearly established. More research is needed on interventions that target provider, system, and policy level factors, particularly interventions that focus on the follow-up of colorectal and breast abnormalities. Standardization of definitions and measures is needed to facilitate comparisons between studies. Cancer 2004. Published in 2004 by the American Cancer Society.",0,1,
1112,Interventions to improve hospital patient satisfaction with health care providers and systems: a systematic review,"Background Many hospital systems are attempting to improve patient satisfaction, as determined by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) surveys. A systematic review of the current experimental evidence could support this effort and does not yet exist. Methods We conducted a systematic literature search by searching electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE, the Cochrane Library's six databases, and gray literature databases. We included studies of hospitalized patients with interventions that targeted at least 1 of the 11 HCAHPS domains and that met our quality filter score on the 27-point Downs and Black coding scale. Where applicable, we have calculated the post-hoc performance. Results A total of 59 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 44 did not meet the 50% quality filter (mean quality score 27.8% ± 10.9%). Of the 15 studies that met the quality filter (mean quality score 67.3% ± 10.7%), 8 targeted the HCAHPS domain “Communication with Physicians”, 6 “Overall Hospital Rating”, 5 “Communication with Nurses”. ’, 5 on ‘pain treatment’ and 5 on ‘communication’ on medication, 5 specific recommendation of the hospital, 3 specific quietness of the hospital environment, 3 specific cleanliness of the hospital environment and 3 specific discharge information. Significant HCAHPS improvements were reported by eight interventions, but their generalizability may be limited by narrowly focused patient populations, heterogeneity of approach, and other methodological concerns. Conclusions Although there are some studies showing some improvement in HCAHPS score by different interventions, we conclude that more rigorous research is needed to identify effective and generalizable interventions to improve patient satisfaction.",0,0,
1113,Interventions to increase the use of electronic health information by healthcare professionals to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes,"BACKGROUND: A large body of health information is available that, when applied to clinical practice, can contribute to effective patient care. Despite a wealth of information, suboptimal care is common. Many factors influence the use of health information by practitioners, and format (electronic or otherwise) can be one such factor. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of interventions aimed at improving or increasing the use of electronic health information (EHI) by healthcare professionals on professional practice and patient outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched The Cochrane Library (Wiley), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and LISA (EBSCO) up to November 2013. We contacted researchers in the field and searched reference lists of relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that assessed the impact of interventions to improve or increase the use of EHI by healthcare professionals on professional practice and patient outcomes. We have defined EHI as information accessed on a computer. We have defined ""use"" as registering with EHI. We considered every doctor involved in patient care. We included randomized, non-randomized, and cluster-randomized controlled trials (RCTs, NRCTs, CRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), and controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs). The comparisons were: electronic versus printed health information”; EHI on various electronic devices (e.g. desktop, laptop or tablet computers, etc.; cellphones/mobile phones); EHI via different user interfaces; EHI with or without an education or training component;' and EHI compared to no other type or source of information. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each study. We used GRADE to assess the quality of included studies. Following our decision to define enrollments in the EHI as a measure of professional conduct, we re-evaluated previously excluded studies. We have given the results in natural units. Where possible, we calculated and reported the mean effect size (odds ratio (OR), interquartile ranges (IQR)). Due to the high heterogeneity of the studies, a meta-analysis was not possible. MAIN RESULTS: We included two RCTs and four CRCTs with 352 physicians, 48 residents, and 135 naturopaths. The overall risk of bias was low, as was the quality of the evidence. One comparison was supported by three studies and three comparisons were supported by individual studies, but the results from the three studies were very heterogeneous. We found no studies supporting EHI versus no alternative. Given these factors, it was not possible to determine the relative effectiveness of the interventions. All studies reported physician use of EHI, two reported adherence to electronic practice guidelines, and none reported patient outcomes. One study (139 participants) measured adherence to an electronic versus a printed guideline, but reported no difference between groups (median OR 0.85, IQR 0.74 to 1.08). A small crossover study (10 participants) reported increased use of clinical guidelines when equipped with a mobile versus stationary desktop computer (mean use per shift: intervention group (IG) 3.6, standard deviation (SD) 1.7 vs. control group (CG) 2.0 (SD 1.9), P value = 0.033). A crossover study (203 participants) reported that the use of a customized versus a generic user interface had little impact on practitioner use of EHI (mean difference in customized study completion rate: 0.77 enrollments/month/user, 95% confidence interval ). (CI) CI 0.43 to 1.11). Three studies included education or training and reported increased use of EHI by practitioners after training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provided no evidence that EHI use leads to improvement in clinical practice or patient outcomes, although it does suggest that EHI use increases when physicians are provided with EHI and education or training. We have defined usage as the activity of logging into an EHI resource, but based on our findings, usage does not automatically imply application of EHI in practice. While the use of EHI can be an important part of evidence-based medicine, it alone is not sufficient to improve patient care or clinical practice. In order for EHI to be used in patient care, it is necessary to understand why physicians are reluctant to use EHI in treating people and to determine the most effective ways to reduce this reluctance.",0,1,
1114,Interventions to change healthcare provider compliance with asthma guidelines: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adherence to asthma guidelines by healthcare providers is poor. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of interventions to improve healthcare provider compliance with asthma guidelines on the healthcare process and clinical outcomes. METHODS: As of July 2012, data sources included Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, PsycINFO, and Research and Development Resource Base in Continuing Medical Education Eligibility Assessments. Investigators abstracted the data one at a time and independently assessed the evidence. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eligible studies were classified by intervention: Decision Support, Organizational Change, Feedback and Audit, Clinical Pharmacy Support, Education Only, Quality Improvement/Payment for Service, Multicomponent, and Information Only. Half were randomized trials (n=35). There was moderate evidence for increased prescribing of controller medications for decision support, feedback and review, and to support clinical pharmacy, and low-level evidence for organizational change and multi-component interventions. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision aids and clinical-pharmaceutical interventions to improve patient delivery of self-education/asthma action plans. Moderate evidence supports the use of decision support tools to reduce ER visits, and low evidence suggests there is no benefit for this outcome with organizational changes, only education and quality improvement/pay for performance. CONCLUSIONS: Decision support tools, feedback and audits, and clinical pharmacy support most likely improved provider compliance with asthma guidelines as measured by outcomes of the healthcare process. There is a need to evaluate provider-focused interventions with standardized outcomes.",0,1,
1115,Interventions to promote evidence-based care for children with ADHD in primary care,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder in children. Community physicians are often the primary providers of services for children with ADHD. A set of consensus guidelines has been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics that provides best practice diagnostic procedures for primary care physicians. These recommendations emphasize the importance of using the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, as a basis for making an ADHD diagnosis and conducting systematic follow-up, including the collection of parent and teacher rating scales to quantitatively assess response to treatment. Although these recommendations are widely used and their adoption is actively encouraged, adherence to guidelines is generally known to be poor. Two types of intervention models, auxiliary service and modification of office systems, have been proposed to encourage the adoption of evidence-based ADHD practice in primary care. This article reviews the effectiveness of these intervention models and discusses the costs and sustainability of each model in relation to the feasibility of intervention dissemination.",0,1,
1116,Intrinsic conflicts of interest in clinical research: disclosure requirements,"Protecting human subjects from investigator conflicts of interest is critical to the integrity of clinical trials. Personal financial conflicts of interest are addressed through university policies, professional association policies, public standards, and government regulations, but “intrinsic conflicts of interest”—conflicts of interest inherent in all clinical research—have received comparatively less attention. Such conflicts arise in all clinical research efforts as a result of the tensions between professionals' responsibilities to their research and their patients and both academic and financial incentives. These conflicts should be disclosed to the research subjects and managed with the same care as financial conflicts of interest.",0,0,
1117,Introduction: Understanding and influencing multi-step factors in the continuum of cancer care,"Health care in the United States is notoriously expensive while often not providing the care recommended by published guidelines. It is therefore necessary to rethink our approach to healthcare. Cancer care is a good example to consider as it encompasses the continuum of health care from primary prevention through long-term survival to end-of-life care. In this monograph, we emphasize that healthcare takes place in a multi-level system that includes organizations, teams, and individuals. In order to achieve healthcare that is consistent with the Institute of Medicine's six quality goals (safety, efficacy, timeliness, efficiency, patient-centricity, and equity), we must affect multiple levels of this multi-level system. The notion that multiple levels of contextual influence influence behavior through interdependent interactions is a well-established ecological view. This view was used to analyze health care and health disparities. However, experience of considering multilevel interventions in health care is much less robust. This monograph contains 13 chapters relevant to expanding the research base for tiered health care interventions. Topics include clinical cases of multilevel thinking in healthcare, state of knowledge on multilevel interventions, study design and measurement considerations, methods for combining interventions, time considerations in assessing impacts, measuring impacts, simulations, application of multilevel thinking to healthcare systems and disparities, as well as implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Our goal is to outline an agenda to proceed with multilevel intervention research, not because it guarantees an improvement in our current approach to healthcare, but because it ignores the complexities of the multilevel environment, in which care takes place, has not achieved the desired improvements in care quality outlined by the Institute of Medicine around the turn of the millennium.",0,0,
1118,Assessment of breast symptoms in primary care: improving consistency with current best advice,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether a targeted intervention could improve primary care physician compliance with guidelines for treating women with breast symptoms. One hundred and twelve practitioners from randomly selected areas across Australia prospectively reviewed their assessments for each woman with a new breast symptom over two 12-week periods, before and five months after the publication of the national guidelines. Between the two audits, the physicians received feedback on practice compared to peers and attended a seminar in their local areas led by specialists from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. Five recommendations had statistically significant improvements at the second audit according to standard guidelines for examining a new breast symptom (INBS). All of this was for examining lumps in the breast. At the first audit there were seven recommendations where practitioners were already treating more than 80% of the women in compliance with the INBS and where there was no statistically significant increase in compliance at the second audit. Another six recommendations showed less agreement with the recommendations before publication of the guidelines and did not improve significantly at the second audit. These generally applied to less frequent presentations and where clinical findings were inconsistent with other test results. We concluded that a targeted intervention improved physician compliance with current best advice for screening women with new breast symptoms in a primary care setting. Further educational programs are needed to improve screening for less common symptoms and to increase physicians' confidence in the results of their clinical assessments.",0,0,
1119,Is it possible to predict improved diabetes outcomes after diabetes self-management training: a longitudinal mixed-methods design,"OBJECTIVE: To predict the diabetes-related outcomes of subjects enrolled in a type 2 diabetes self-management education (DSME) program from their baseline data. DESIGN: A mixed-methods longitudinal experimental study. 6 practicing nurses and 2 clinical academics performed blind assessments of all baseline and process data to predict clinical, behavioral, and psychological outcomes 6 months after the DSME program. SETTING: Basic care. PARTICIPANTS: -31 people with type 2 diabetes who had not previously had a DSME. INTERVENTION: All participants completed the Diabetes Manual 1:1 self-paced 12-week DSME program supported by office nurses trained as Diabetes Manual Facilitators. OUTCOME VARIABLES: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), diabetes knowledge, physical activity, waist circumference, self-efficacy, diabetes distress, anxiety, depression, demographics, change talk, and treatment satisfaction. These variables were chosen because they are known to affect self-management behavior or have been empirically affected by a DSME program. RESULTS: Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were available for 27 participants, of whom 13 (48%) were male, 22 (82%) were white British, mean age 59 years, and mean duration of type 2 diabetes 9.1 years. Significant reductions were seen in HbA1c t(26)=2.35, p=0.03 and diabetes distress t(26)=2.30, p=0.03 and a significant gain in knowledge t(26)=-2.06 , p=0.05 observed between baseline and 6 months. No significant changes were seen in waist circumference, physical activity, anxiety, depression, or self-efficacy. The accuracy of the predictions varied little between clinical academics and practicing nurses, but greatly between outcomes (0–100%). The median and mode accuracy of the predicted result was 66.67%. The prediction accuracy for the key result HbA1c was 44.44%. Diabetes distress had the highest predictive accuracy (81.48%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in this small study were unable to identify individuals who were likely to achieve improvement in outcomes from DSME. DSME should be encouraged according to guidelines in all patients with diabetes.",0,0,
1120,"Is the provider type associated with cancer screening and prevention: Registered Nurses, Physician Assistants and Physicians","BACKGROUND: Physician recommendations for cancer screening and prevention are associated with patient compliance. However, time constraints can limit physicians' ability to provide all recommended preventive services, especially given the increasing demand from the Affordable Care Act in the United States. A team-based practice that includes Registered Nursing and Physician Assistants (APRN/PA) can help meet this need. This study examines the association between an APRN/PA visit and receiving guideline-compliant cancer screening and prevention recommendations. METHODS: Data from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression to assess provider type viewed and receipt of guideline-compliant cancer screening and prevention recommendations (n = 26,716). RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, women who visited a primary care physician (PCP) and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA in the past 12 months were more likely to meet guidelines for cervical and breast cancer screening than women who did did not see PCP or APRN/PA (all p<0.0001 for provider type). Women and men who saw a PCP and an APRN/PA or a PCP without an APRN/PA were also more likely to receive guideline-based colorectal cancer screening and advice to quit smoking and exercise than women and men who did not see a PCP or APRN/PA (all p<0.01 for provider type). CONCLUSIONS: Attending a PCP alone or in conjunction with an APRN/PA is associated with the patient receiving guideline-compliant cancer prevention and screening recommendations. Integrating APRN/PA into primary care can aid in the delivery of cancer prevention and early detection services. Further intervention research efforts are needed to examine how APRN/PA will best be able to improve cancer screening, HPV vaccination and the receipt of behavioral counseling, particularly in this era of healthcare reform.",0,0,
1121,"Is there a gap between recommended and ""real world"" practice in treating depression in young people? A medical record audit of the practice","BACKGROUND: The literature has shown that the dissemination of guidelines alone is not sufficient to ensure that guideline recommendations are integrated into everyday clinical practice. METHODS: Our aim was to investigate the gaps between guideline recommendations and clinical practice in the management of young people with depression by conducting a medical record review in a community psychiatric service for 15- to 25-year-olds in Melbourne, Australia, in a catchment area performed. RESULTS: The results showed that assessing and recording depression severity to ensure appropriate treatment planning was neither systematic nor consistent"";"" that the majority of young people (74.5%) were prescribed an antidepressant before an adequate attempt at psychotherapy was made, and that fewer than 50% monitored suicidal behavior for improvement in depression symptoms and for antidepressant treatment (35% and 30% respectively). Encouragingly, 92% of first-line prescriptions for people under 18 who were previously antidepressant-naïve were fluoxetine as recommended. CONCLUSIONS: This research has highlighted the need for targeted strategies to ensure effective implementation. These strategies could include practice system tools that allow for systematic monitoring of depression symptoms and adverse events, particularly suicidal behavior. In addition, adolescent-specific psychotherapy that contains the most effective components for this age group and is delivered in an adolescent-friendly manner would likely support the effective implementation of guideline recommendations for participation in an appropriate psychotherapy study before medication is initiated.",0,0,
1122,Is an untargeted outreach visit to primary care effective? A pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in clinical care. However, they are not self-implementing. Outreach visits can improve prescribing behavior. METHODS: Within a pragmatic, randomized, controlled before-after study involving all general practices in a health district, routine methods were used to distribute guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori eradication. Intervention practices were offered a visit and an audit conducted by a pharmacist trained in outreach techniques. The intervention was assessed using Level 3 Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data for metronidazole and omeprazole for the two 12-month periods surrounding the introduction of the guidelines. RESULTS: Of the 38 intervention practices, 19 accepted an outreach visit and three accepted the offer of an audit. There was a significant increase in omeprazole use during the study of 0.24 [95 percent confidence interval (CI) +0.19 to +0.29] dose units per year, but no effect by supply [-0.02 (95 percent CI -0.12 to +0.08) dose units] or acceptance of a visit [-0.03 (95 percent CI -0.15 to +0.08) dose units]. Results for metronidazole were similar, with an increase in use of 0.028 (95% CI +0.018 to +0.038) dose units per year. The effect of the intervention was a non-significant change in prescription of -0.005 (95 percent CI -0.025 to +0.015) dose units. Accepting a visit had little effect on prescribing: a change of 0.003 (95 percent CI -0.021 to +0.027) dose units. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of untargeted outreach visits is probably not a viable strategy.",0,0,
1123,Issues related to the protection of human research participants,"Making ethical decisions related to the protection of human research participants is often complex and fraught with uncertainty and conflict.

Ongoing dialogue and discussion of these ethical issues will provide a basis for strengthening nursing research and practice while ensuring the maximum protections for the research participants that enable the advancement of nursing science.",0,0,
1124,It's not just about motivating healthcare professionals to practice hand hygiene by focusing on patients.,"Disease often spreads in hospitals because medical staff do not wash their hands. Research suggests that to improve health and safety behavior it is important to highlight the personal consequences for the actor. However, as people (and especially healthcare professionals) tend to be overconfident about personal immunity, perhaps the most effective hand hygiene messages are those that highlight the implications for other people. In two field experiments in a hospital, we compared the effectiveness of hand hygiene messages that emphasized personal safety (“hand hygiene protects against disease”) or patient safety (“hand hygiene protects patients from disease”). We assessed hand hygiene by measuring the amount of soap and hand sanitizer gel used from dispensers (experiment 1) and by making covert, independent observations of hand hygiene behavior by healthcare professionals (experiment 2). The results showed that changing a single word in messages led to meaningful behavioral changes: healthcare professionals' hand hygiene increased significantly when reminded of the effects on patients, but not when reminded of the effects on themselves .",1,1,

1126,JNC-7 Guidelines: Are They Still Relevant?,"The recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), published in 2003, are largely relevant today. Reducing blood pressure (BP) to target in hypertensive patients is of paramount importance in reducing cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive drugs vary in their effectiveness in lowering blood pressure and may have non-hypertensive effects on cardiovascular events, particularly with regard to the prevention of heart failure and stroke. Thiazide-type diuretics have been recommended as the first line of choice for treating hypertension in most patients, and this is still an appropriate recommendation. Several other classes were recommended as the next priority, but beta-blockers should now play a lesser role in treating uncomplicated hypertension. While a new JNC report would be reassuring to practitioners and should include some changes since JNC 7, I think most of the recommendations are still relevant today.",0,0,
1127,JOURNAL CLUB: Predictors of Provider Response to Clinical Decision Support: Lessons from the Medicare Imaging Demonstration,"OBJECTIVE: The effectiveness of imaging clinical decision support (CDS) varies. Our goal was to identify CDS factors that contribute to cancellation or modification of imaging orders. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This before and after study was conducted at four institutions participating in the Medicare Imaging Demonstration. The intervention was CDS upon order for selected outpatient imaging procedures. Based on the information entered, EDP warnings indicated to the providers whether orders were not in line with the guidelines, appropriate, of uncertain appropriateness or inappropriate according to the guidelines of the trade association. Order Providers could override or accept CDS. We viewed actionable alerts as those that could prompt an immediate change in the prescribing behavior of the prescribing physician (ie, canceling inappropriate prescriptions or changing prescriptions of uncertain appropriateness for which an alternative was recommended). Chi-square and logistic regression identified predictors of order cancellation or modification after an alert. RESULTS: A total of 98,894 radiology orders were entered (83,114 after intervention). Vendors ignored 98.9% of orders, modified 1.1%, and canceled 0.03% of orders in response to alerts. Actionable alerts had a 10-fold higher change (8.1% vs. 0.7%; p<0.0001) or cancellation (0.2% vs. 0.02%; p<0.0001) orders in comparison on unactionable alerts 7x lower cancellation or change rate than sites with newly implemented CDS (1.4% vs. 0.2%; p<0.0001) In multivariate analysis, actionable alerts were 12x more likely to result in cancellation or changing orders on pre-existing CDS, they were 7.7 times less likely to be canceled or changed (p<0.0001). These results may have implications for the future design of such computerized systems.",1,1,
1128,Health-care worker rule-related behavior assessments: An experimental study,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the assessment of rule-related behavior by healthcare professionals and the general public in the UK as clinical guidelines and protocols proliferate. DESIGN: A questionnaire survey was used in which brief scenarios describing medical practice were presented to a sample of health professionals and members of the general public. METHODS: The healthcare sample consisted of 315 nurses, doctors and midwives from three English National Health Service (NHS) trusts who volunteered to take part in the study. A stratified sample of members of the general public (N=350) was recruited through a market research firm. Three types of behavior (adherence to protocol, violation of protocol, and improvisation where no protocol exists) and three types of patient outcomes (good, bad, bad) were manipulated in nine scenarios. Respondents were asked to provide judgments about (1) the inappropriateness of the behavior, (2) the likelihood that they would take further action, and (3) responsibility for the outcome. RESULTS: The results suggest that the nursing process has a greater impact on the assessment of health professional behavior than the outcome of that behavior. This applied equally to the professional and public rehearsals. CONCLUSIONS: The study has both theoretical and practical implications. First, information about a behavior's relationship to existing rules has a stronger impact than the behavior's consequence on attributions of responsibility. Second, the use of clinical protocols as a risk management tool in the NHS can be counterproductive if full compliance is not achieved.",0,0,

1130,Prudent use of antibiotics in common pediatric respiratory infections,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among common bacteria that cause respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, has become a major global public health problem. The use of antibiotics, whether or not medically justified for a particular disease, contributes to the development of resistant bacteria. To curb the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, members of the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently published principles for the prudent use of antibiotics for common pediatric respiratory infections, including the common cold, otitis media, sinusitis, and tonsillopharyngitis. This article provides an overview of the CDC/AAP principles for treating these diseases and describes the results of field clinical studies that have attempted to improve the prudent use of antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The success of the CDC/AAP principles in containing the growth of antimicrobial resistance depends on their implementation. The results of clinical practice studies indicate that judicious use of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric respiratory infections can be achieved through education and perseverance. Greater education and behavior change efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and stem the still burgeoning problem of bacterial resistance.",0,0,

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTINGS: Survey and regulatory data from 628 home care patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were treated by nurses who were randomly assigned to usual care or to one of two intervention groups. The basic intervention was an email to the patient's caregiver highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention supplemented the initial care reminder with additional clinician and patient resources. DATA COLLECTION: Patient interviews were conducted 45 days after enrollment to measure self-management behavior, heart failure-specific outcomes (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-KCCQ), health-related quality of life (EuroQoL), and use of the service. MAIN RESULTS: Both interventions improved the mean KCCQ summary score (15.3 and 12.9 percent, respectively) compared to usual care (p < or = 0.05). The baseline intervention also resulted in a higher EuroQoL score compared to usual care (p < or = 0.05).

1134,Evidence-based just-in-time email 'reminders' in homecare: implications for 'nursing practices'.,"objective. To test the effectiveness of two interventions aimed at improving the adoption of evidence-based practices by home caregivers caring for heart failure (HF) patients. Data Sources/Study Setting. Information on nursing practices was extracted from the clinical records of patients admitted to the care of 354 study nurses at a large, municipal, non-profit home care facility between June 2000 and November 2001. study design. The study used a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or to one of two intervention groups after identifying an eligible patient. The basic intervention was a one-time email reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The extended intervention consisted of the initial email reminder supplemented by prompts from the provider, patient education material, and contact with clinical nurses. data collection. At each home health visit that a study nurse performed on an eligible heart failure patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to collect information about whether the nurse followed the nursing practices highlighted in the email reminder has performed . main results. Both the basic and extended interventions have significantly improved the practice of evidence-based care according to patient records in the areas of patient assessment and instruction in managing heart failure. While not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases, and effect sizes were often large. Conclusions. The results of this randomized study strongly support the effectiveness of evidence-based just-in-time reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home health caregivers who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.",1,1,
1135,Kids Safe and Smokefree (KiSS): a randomized controlled trial of a multi-step intervention to reduce tobacco smoke exposure in children,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to secondhand smoke (SHSe) harms children's health, yet effective interventions to reduce SHSe in children at home and in the car have proven difficult in pediatric practice. A multi-step intervention that combines counseling from pediatric healthcare providers with behavioral counseling and navigation to pharmacological cessation aids can improve SHSe control in pediatric populations. METHODS/DESIGN: This study used a randomized, two-group design with three measurement periods: pre-intervention, end-of-treatment, and 12-month follow-up. Smoking parents of children <11 years are recruited from children's hospitals. Clinical-level intervention includes the integration of tobacco intervention guideline prompts into electronic medical record screens. Guide providers are encouraged to ask all parents about SHSe harms in children, provide advice on SHSe harms, and refer smokers to smoking cessation resources. After receiving a clinical intervention, eligible parents will be randomized to receive: (a) a 3-month behavioral counseling telephone intervention aimed at reducing SHSe in children, parental smoking cessation, and navigation to access nicotine replacement therapy or cessation medication or (b) a nutritional education intervention for attentional control. Healthcare providers and assessors are blind to the group assignment. Cotinine is used to verify the child's SHSe status (primary outcome) and the parent's withdrawal status. DISCUSSION: This study tests an innovative multi-step approach to reducing childhood SHSe. The approach is sustainable because clinics can easily integrate the prompts for tobacco intervention associated with the “Ask, Counsel, and Refer” guidelines into electronic health records and refer smokers to free, evidence-based behavioral counseling interventions such as government quitlines.

1136,"Kindergarten readiness after prematurity: Integrating health, development, and behavioral functioning to optimize educational outcomes in at-risk children","In the past 20 years, many advances (eg, maternal steroids and surfactants) have changed the course of neonatal medicine. As a result, extremely preterm infants survive medical complications that were previously fatal. After discharge from the NICU, preterm infants may continue to face a range of medical and developmental challenges, and their families face the potentially daunting task of caring for an at-risk child. Families may be referred to multiple systems of care, including primary care physicians, pediatric subspecialists, and early intervention services. The ultimate goal for preterm infants is to optimize their motor, communicative, social-emotional and adaptive development and to support their learning at home, at school and in the community. As children transition into school, key indicators of their functional status are the amount of developmental, educational, habilitation, and behavioral support they need to participate in learning activities with their peers. Success can be measured by whether preterm babies are ready for learning in large groups with their peers and how much support is needed for this important transition. The purpose of this review is to describe what is known about certain indicators of school readiness in preterm infants, including neurodevelopmental disorders, social-emotional skills, and social factors. We conclude with guidelines for using this transition as an important indicator of developmental trajectories that can help us better understand risk and resilience in this vulnerable population of children.",0,0,
1137,"Knowledge, attitude and use of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening in general practitioners","BACKGROUND: The results of the National Lung Screening Trial showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality when high-risk patients were examined with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) versus chest X-ray (CXR). The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a Class B recommendation for LDCT screening, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers now cover the cost of screening under certain conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and use of LDCT screening for lung cancer among general practitioners. METHODS: A 32-item questionnaire was distributed to members of the South Carolina Academy of Family Physicians in 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There were 101 respondents, and most were misinformed about which organizations recommend screening. Many physicians continued to recommend CXR for lung cancer screening. Most felt that LDCT screening increases the likelihood of detecting disease at earlier stages (98%) and that the benefits outweighed the disadvantages (75%). Concerns included unnecessary procedures (88%), stress/anxiety (52%) and exposure to radiation (50%). Most physicians have discussed the risks/benefits of screening with their patients to some extent (76%), however more than 50% reported having made 1 or no screening recommendations in the past year Referrals low There are gaps in physicians' knowledge of screening guidelines and reimbursement, suggesting a need for further education Developing decision aids can facilitate shared decision-making discussions about screening and Targeted interventions can fill gaps in knowledge.

1138,Knowledge translation of research results,"Background One of the most enduring lessons from clinical and health care research is the failure to translate research into practice and policy. As a result of these gaps between evidence, practice, and policy, patients do not benefit optimally from advances in healthcare and are exposed to unnecessary risks of iatrogenic harm, and healthcare systems are exposed to unnecessary expenditures that result in significant opportunity costs. Over the past decade, international policy and research attention has increased on how to narrow the gap between evidence and practice and policy. In this paper, we summarize the current concepts and evidence to guide knowledge translation activities, defined as T2 research (the translation of new clinical knowledge into improved health). We structure the article around five key questions: what to transfer; to whom should research knowledge be transferred; through whom should research knowledge be transferred; how should research knowledge be transferred;"" and with what effect should research knowledge be transferred? Discussion We propose that the basic unit of knowledge translation should normally be recent systematic reviews or other syntheses of research results. Knowledge translators need to identify the key messages for different audiences and translate them into Transform language and knowledge translation products that can be easily assimilated by different audiences. The relative importance of knowledge translation for different audiences depends on the type of research, and appropriate endpoints of knowledge translation may vary by stakeholder. There are a large number of planned knowledge translation models, derived from different disciplinary, contextual (ie setting) and target group points of view, most of which indicate that a planned translation of knowledge Education for healthcare professionals and consumers is more likely to be successful if the choice of knowledge translation strategy is based on an assessment of likely barriers and enablers. Although our evidence for the likely effectiveness of different strategies for overcoming specific barriers is incomplete, there are a number of informative systematic reviews of interventions targeted at healthcare professionals and consumers (i.e., patients, family members, and informal carers) and factors affecting they are important research uses by policy makers. Summary There is an extensive (albeit incomplete) evidence base to guide the choices of knowledge translation activities for healthcare professionals and consumers. The evidence base on the impact of different knowledge translation approaches aimed at policymakers and healthcare leaders is much weaker, but there is a wealth of innovative approaches that warrant further evaluation.",0,0,
1139,Knowledge translation of the American College of Emergency Physicians clinical guideline on syncope using computer-assisted clinical decision support,"OBJECTIVES: To influence practice behaviors of physicians after implementing a computer-assisted clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the recommendations of the 2007 ACEP Clinical Policy on Syncope. METHODS: This was a pre-post intervention with a prospective cohort and retrospective controls. We conducted a review of the medical histories of consecutive adult patients with syncope. A computerized CDSS has been embedded in the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS) that prompts physicians to explain their imaging and admissions decisions in patients with syncope based on the ACEP Clinical Policy recommendations. The medical records of 410 consecutive adult patients with syncope were reviewed prior to implementation, and 301 records were reviewed post-implementation. Primary endpoints were physician practice behaviors as indicated by admission rate and head computed tomography (CT) imaging rate before and after implementation. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the admission rate before and after the intervention (68.1% vs. 60.5%, p=0.036). There was no significant difference in the head CT imaging rate before and after the intervention (39.8% vs. 43.2%, p=0.358). There were seven physicians who saw ten or more patients during pre- and post-intervention. The subgroup analysis of the practice behavior of these seven physicians revealed a slight significant difference in the admission rate before and after the intervention (74.3% vs. 63.9%, p = 0.0495) and no significant difference in the head CT scan rate before and post-intervention (42.9% vs. 45.4%, p=0.660). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of an evidence-based CDSS based on the ACEP Clinical Policy recommendations on syncope correlated with a change in physician practice behavior in an urban academic emergency department. This change suggests that the recommendations of the Emergency Medicine Clinical Practice Guidelines can be integrated into the physician workflow of an EDIS to improve the quality of practice.",1,1,
1140,Knowledge versus practice: The need for education for successful guideline implementation,"This study assessed physicians' familiarity with a practice guideline for bronchiolitis, assessed attitudes towards guidelines, determined preference of educational materials for guideline accessibility, and examined the relationship between guideline familiarity and attitudes towards behavior in clinical practice. Six months after implementation of the guideline, surveys were distributed to eligible physicians. The response rate was 68%. Retrospective analyzes of inhalation therapies across three study cohorts were also performed. Most physicians interviewed in this study were aware of and were using a recently established guideline, despite continued use of unproven inhalation therapies. Despite proven effectiveness of care, ongoing educational intervention is necessary to maintain these gains.",0,0,
1141,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to breast cancer screening among educated Appalachian women","PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine how and what women learn about breast cancer and screening practices and what factors influence women's breast cancer screening practices. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of questionnaire data collected at the time of enrollment in a clinical trial. SETTING: Breast care center at a mid-Atlantic academic health sciences center. SAMPLE: 185 women in a mostly rural Appalachian state. METHODS: Participants completed the Modified Toronto Breast Self-Examination Inventory and personal mammography practice questions at the time of enrollment before being randomized into a longitudinal clinical intervention study. KEY RESEARCH VARIABLES: Female demographics, knowledge of breast cancer screening practices, adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines, and motivation, knowledge, and practice skills related to breast cancer screening. RESULTS: These educated women had knowledge deficits about breast cancer, breast cancer risk factors, and screening guidelines, particularly about the timing and behavior of breast self-examination. Women who were tutored in health care and cancer screening by health care providers, including advanced nurses, had greater knowledge about breast cancer and detection practices. Conclusions: Women still have knowledge deficits about breast cancer, breast cancer detection and personal risk factors. In addition, some educated women in this study failed to practice breast cancer screening according to current guidelines. CARE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians must continue to remind and update women of breast disease, and women's cancer screening processes must be strengthened. All levels of providers should improve their rates of performing clinical breast exams with physical exams. Nurses, who have a major impact on women's healthcare, need to stay current in their knowledge of breast disease, screening and treatment.",0,0,
1142,KRAS and colorectal cancer: ethical and pragmatic issues in effecting real-time change in clinical trials and oncology practice,"Systemic therapy has resulted in almost four times longer median survival in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) than best supportive care, a result achieved through the combination of chemotherapeutic agents and targeted biologics. Although the latter may contain antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor like cetuximab and panitumumab, we now have strong evidence that patients whose tumors have mutant KRAS do not benefit from this class of drugs. However, it took several years for acceptance of the reliability and importance of the KRAS data to develop for a variety of reasons. The timeline from the presentation and publication of small, retrospective phase II studies to widespread acceptance of the predictive value of KRAS and behavioral changes, changes in ongoing national studies in advanced/metastatic CRC, changes in national guidelines and practice patterns, and adjustments to those identified Indications for the monoclonal antibody was lengthy. In this commentary, we discuss whether the process of data disclosure regarding KRAS status and management of patients with advanced CRC was effective in enabling timely decisions about ongoing publicly funded clinical trials, and whether such decisions were rational, ethical, or not. The overall objectives are to highlight lessons learned regarding the early disclosure of clinical trial results, the review and acceptance of new scientific data, and to propose changes for dealing with similar situations in the future.",0,0,

The usual, old standard form was used by a control group of 28 general practitioners in another region. After using the old standard form of 178 tests for 5 months, the experimental group received forms listing only 15 hematological and chemical tests and several urine and fecal tests, and space was allowed for ""Others"". A comparison of the test and control periods showed that the number of monthly examinations in the test group was reduced by 18. With the reintroduction of the usual standard form, GPs quickly reverted to their old pattern.

In addition, limiting and restructuring the test order forms can break the routine, but does not significantly change the reasoning of the test order behavior.",1,1,
1144,Lack of effectiveness of table reminder in relation to knowledge and attitudes of JNC-VI and NCEP-III guidelines in primary care medicine,"BACKGROUND: The literature shows that resident physicians and practicing physicians exhibit an attitudinal-behavioural discrepancy regarding their positive attitude towards clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and the translation of these guidelines into clinical practice patterns. METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to determine if changing a previously identified CPG compliance factor (accessibility) would result in a significant increase in knowledge and attitudes of primary care physicians towards the guidelines. The primary study intervention involved the publication of a summary of the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP III) CPGs in all patient records (> 18 years) for a three-month period. The JNC VI and NCEP III guidelines were also distributed to each resident of Wayne State Family Medicine, and a copy of each guideline was placed in the Preceptor's area of the participating clinics. Identical pre- and post-intervention questionnaires were administered to all residents regarding CPG knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: Post-intervention analysis failed to demonstrate a significant difference in CPG knowledge. A statistically significant difference after the intervention was only found for the attitude question. The barriers to CPG compliance were identified as 1) lack of CPG instructions; 2) lack of critical judgment skills; 3) insufficient time; 4) lack of CPG accessibility;' and 5) lack of factorial modelling. CONCLUSION: This study showed no significant changes in CPG knowledge after the intervention and only one question reflecting a change in attitude. Broader resident access to dedicated clinic time, increased faculty modeling, and implementation of an electronic recording/reminder system that uses a team-based approach are compliance factors that should be considered for further investigation. Interpretation of CPG non-compliance will benefit from a causal matrix focused on physician knowledge, attitudes and behavior. Recent findings on resident knowledge-behaviour discordances may direct future investigation of physician non-adherence to guidelines away from general barrier research and toward the development of information that maximizes the individual physician's sense of urgency and reassurance.",0,1,

1147,Learning Evaluation: Merging quality improvement and implementation research methodologies to study innovation in healthcare,"Background In health care change interventions, local learning about the implementation process is often lost as the primary focus is on improving outcomes. This paper describes Learning Evaluation, a methodological approach that combines quality improvement and implementation research methods to examine innovations in healthcare. Methods Learning Evaluation is an approach to cross-organizational evaluation. Qualitative and quantitative data is collected to conduct a real-time assessment of implementation processes while evaluating changes in context, facilitating quality improvements using history charts and audit and feedback, and generating transferrable lessons. Five principles underpin this approach: (1) collect data to describe changes being made by healthcare organizations and how changes are implemented; (2) collect process and outcome data relevant to healthcare organizations and the research team; (3) assess contextual factors at multiple levels affecting implementation, process, outcome, and transferability, (4) assist healthcare organizations in using data for continuous quality improvement, and (5) operationalize common measurement strategies to achieve transferable outcomes organizations through the following : (1) build a detailed understanding of the baseline implementation plan; (2) identification of target groups and tracking of relevant process measures; (3) Collection and analysis of real-time quantitative and qualitative data on important contextual factors; (4 ) synthesizing data and new insights and ongoing exchange with stakeholders;' and (5) harmonizing and promoting learning from process and outcome data. Application to a multi-site program focused on primary care and behavioral health integration demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of learner evaluation for generating real-time insights into evolving implementation processes. Conclusions Learning evaluation generates systematic and rigorous cross-organizational insights on the implementation of healthcare innovation while improving organizational capacity and accelerating the translation of insights by enabling continuous learning at individual sites. Researchers evaluating change initiatives and healthcare organizations implementing improvement initiatives can benefit from a Learning Evaluation approach.",0,0,
1148,Learning with computer-aided guidelines in the general practice? A randomized controlled trial.,"Background. Evidence-based guidelines are considered an important tool for transferring scientifically generated findings into everyday clinical practice and ensuring high standards in clinical care. Despite widespread use, clinical guidelines have so far only had a limited impact on individual professional learning and on changes in daily medical practice. Goals. Our goals were (i) to investigate potential knowledge gains among German general practitioners after the implementation of web- and evidence-based guidelines and (ii) to identify and analyze potential barriers to individual professional learning with computer-based guidelines. methods. A prospective, randomized, controlled study was conducted with 72 general practitioners (21% female, 79% male). The intervention group (n = 38) had access to clinical guidelines via the Internet or CD-ROM, while the control group did not (n = 34). Both groups received a standardized two-part questionnaire. An increase in knowledge was measured with 25 multiple-choice questions on four different medical topics. In addition, reasons for the use or non-use of computerized guidelines were analyzed after guidelines were open to all participating physicians. Results. There was no significant knowledge gain in the intervention group (p = 0.69). Twenty-two (58%) general practitioners in the intervention group had used the guidelines. Unspecified curiosity (76%) and a specific medical question (38%) were the predominant motives for use by physicians who had applied the guideline. Among the 'non-users', 78% cited 'lack of time' as the main reason for not using guidelines. Conclusion. Efficient knowledge transfer through computerized guidelines was not achieved. Utilization, individual learning and possible implementation depend on appropriate incentives and pragmatic aspects of clinical practice: easy and quick access.",0,1,

A smaller proportion of patients within the intervention group initiated visits because of their asthma: 34 (22%) vs 111 (34%), odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.37-0 ,95)”; "" and experienced acute asthma exacerbations: 12 (8%) vs. 57 (17%), OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.21-0.85 six months after the introduction of the computer decision support software. There were no discernible differences in reported symptoms, maintenance medication prescriptions, or use of hospital services between the two groups.Conclusion: The use of computer decision support software that implements guidelines during patient consultations may improve clinical outcomes for patients with asthma.",0,1,
1153,Lessons learned from the assessment of the UK NHS R&D Implementation Methods Program,"Background Concerns about the effective use of research was a key reason for the establishment of the NHS Research and Development Program in 1991. In 1994 an Advisory Group was established to identify research priorities in conducting research. This resulted in the Implementation Methods Program (IMP), whose client group funded 36 projects. In 2000, responsibility for the program passed to the National Coordinating Center for NHS Service Delivery and Organization R&D, which asked Brunel University's Health Economics Research Group (HERG) to conduct an evaluation in 2002. By this time most of the projects had been completed. This evaluation should cover: the quality of the results, lessons learned from the communication strategy and the commissioning process, and the benefits of the projects. Methods We used a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods. These included: document analysis, interviews with key stakeholders, questionnaires to the funded lead researchers, questionnaires to potential users and desk analysis. Results The quantitative assessment of the results and dissemination revealed that the IMP funded useful research projects, some of which had a significant impact on the different categories of the HERG payback model, such as: B. Publications, further research, research training, implications for health policy and clinical practice. Qualitative findings from interviews with advisory and commissioning group members indicated that implementation research was a relatively unexplored field when the IMP was established. This was reflected in the roles of the members of the Advisory and Commissioning Groups, the way research priorities were selected and developed and the research projects commissioned. The ideological and methodological debates associated with these decisions continued among those working in the field. Of particular importance was the need for an effective communication strategy for the program as a whole. However, such a strategy was never developed, making it difficult to ascertain the overall impact of the IMP as a programme. Conclusion Our insights into the implications of the funded work and the difficulties faced by those developing the IMP have implications for the development of strategic research programs in general, as well as for the development of more effective research in this area.",0,0,

1155,Using insights from behavioral economics to increase the value of health service delivery,"United States healthcare spending continues to grow at an unsustainable rate. A more recent movement to increase price transparency has been proposed to reduce the rate of increase in spending, with legislative efforts at both the state and federal levels. While this may seem like a good idea on the surface, simply providing pricing information to physicians, particularly trainees, may not bring about the kind of big changes in practice patterns that proponents expect. The manner in which price transparency is implemented is likely to play a significant role in its effectiveness as an intervention. In this article, the authors review transparency efforts and default options from other contexts, and use insights from behavioral economics to make recommendations to increase the likelihood that price transparency will lead physicians to weigh the relative value of interventions.",0,1,
1156,LGB Affirmative Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for Young Adult Gay and Bisexual Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Transdiagnostic Minority Stress Approach,"OBJECTIVES: We tested the preliminary efficacy of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural treatment adapted to improve depression, anxiety, and co-occurring health risks (e.g., alcohol use, sexual compulsion, sex without a condom) in young adult gay and bisexual men. Treatment adjustments have focused on reducing minority stress processes underlying mental health inequalities related to sexual orientation. METHOD: Young gay and bisexual males (n=63; mean age=25.94) were randomized to receive immediate treatment or a 3-month wait-list. At the baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments, participants completed self-reports on minority mental health and stress and completed an interview on risky behaviors over the past 90 days. RESULTS: Compared to waiting list, treatment significantly reduced depressive symptoms (b = -2.43, 95% CI: -4.90, 0.35, p<0.001), alcohol use problems (b = -3.79, 95% CI : -5.94, -1.64). , p < 0.001), sexual compulsion (b = -5.09, 95% CI: -8.78, -1.40, p < 0.001), and condomless sex with casual partners in the past 90 days (b = -1, 09, 95% CI: -1.80, -0.37, p<0.001) and improved condom use self-efficacy (b=10.08, 95% CI: 3.86, 16.30, p<0.001). Treatment resulted in anxiety symptoms (b = -2.14, 95% CI: -4.61, 0.34, p = 0.09) and heavy alcohol consumption in the last 90 days (b = -0.32, 95 %) to moderate and marginally significantly greater improvements than on the waitlist. CI: -0.71, 0.07, p=0.09). Effects generally persisted at follow-up. Minority stress processes showed small improvements in the expected direction. CONCLUSION: This study showed preliminary support for the first intervention, which was adapted to address the co-occurring health problems of gay and bisexual men at their source in minority stress. If shown to be effective compared to standard evidence-based treatments, the treatment will have significant potential to help clinicians translate LGB-affirming treatment guidelines into evidence-based practice.

1157,Lifestyle advice through primary health care to prevent cardiovascular disease,"BACKGROUND: The Working Group on Hypertension of the Norwegian College of General Practitioners reports in this paper on the documentation of behavioral advice in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The focus is on high blood pressure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The recommendations are mainly based on updated meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials. Hypertension is treated to prevent cardiovascular disease"";"" That's why we value documentation with meaningful endpoints. The validity of the documentation for general practice is assessed. We also evaluated whether certain behavior change methods or theories might be helpful for the GP. RESULTS: The value of smoking bans, dietary advice (increasing grain, vegetable, fruit, poultry and fish consumption), and exercise advice are well documented and applicable in general practice. Respecting patient autonomy and taking an interest in patients and their health-related habits appear to be important factors in improving the physician's ability to influence patient behavior. INTERPRETATION: The value of lifestyle advice is well documented and should play an important role in clinical strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients.",0,0,

METHODS: DESIGN: Prospective comparison of baseline vs. postintervention and comparison of enrolled patients vs. controls extracted from a large primary care database. SETTING: 94 general practitioner practices in Italy. PARTICIPANTS: All 20-70-year-old hypercholesterolemic subjects, guideline ineligible for statin treatment, followed on 12 specified work days; 713 patients; 94 general practitioners. INTERVENTION: Brief (5-10 min) educational intervention (quality dietary advice, encouragement of walking or other aerobic physical activity); ""Delivery of simple dietary advice based on physician judgment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total cholesterol levels and global cardiovascular risk calculated using the Framingham equation. RESULTS: Total cholesterol and global cardiovascular risk (10 years) decreased by 0.31 mmol/L (p<0.0001, 95% CI 0.23-0.40) and 1.35% (p<0.01, 95% CI -1.73 to -0.97), at a 54-month follow-up Enrolled patients had greater reductions in total cholesterol than control patients: 2.24% (p<0.05, 95% CI 0 .58-3.91%).CONCLUSIONS: A simple, outpatient, long-term lifestyle counseling program results in small but clinically significant reductions in total cholesterol and global cardiovascular risk.This finding should encourage primary care physicians to improve all of their patients systematically offering simple, unstructured lifestyle advice.",0,0,
1160,Lifestyle interventions in primary health care: professional and organizational challenges,"BACKGROUND: Interventions that support patients' efforts to make lifestyle changes that reduce tobacco use, hazardous alcohol use, unhealthy eating habits, and insufficient physical activity represent important areas of development for health care. Recent research shows that it is difficult to move health care toward Reorient health promotion. The aim of this study was to examine the extent of health professionals' work with lifestyle interventions in Swedish primary health care and to describe professional knowledge, attitudes and perceived organizational support for lifestyle interventions. Methods: The study is based on a web-based cross-sectional survey of general practitioners, other physicians, residents, nurses and registered nurses (n = 315) in primary health care. RESULTS: 59% of participants reported that lifestyle interventions were an essential part of their tasks. A majority (77%) would like to work more with patients' lifestyles. Health professionals generally reported a thorough knowledge of lifestyle intervention methods for disease prevention. Significant differences between the professional groups were revealed with regard to specific knowledge and the extent of work with lifestyle interventions. Alcohol was the least addressed lifestyle habit. Management was supportive, but structures to sustain work with lifestyle interventions were scarce and a need for national guidance was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Health professionals reported thorough knowledge and positive attitudes towards lifestyle interventions. When planning the further implementation of lifestyle interventions in primary health care, differences between the professional groups in terms of knowledge, scope of work with the promotion of healthy lifestyles and lifestyle issues, and the provision of organizational support such as national guidelines should be taken into account.",0,0,
1161,Lifestyle or Life Saving Drugs? A primary opinion poll of healthcare professionals and consumers on over-the-counter statins,"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter (OTC) simvastatin 10 mg was launched in the UK in July 2004 with the aim of improving primary prevention of ischemic heart disease. AIM: To document the views of key stakeholders (general practitioners [GPs], pharmacists, and consumers) on issues related to the reclassification of simvastatin to OTC availability, highlighting differences between stakeholders, and identifying factors likely to influence consumer behavior. METHODS: Eight months after the launch of OTC simvastatin in the UK, a self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among GPs, pharmacists and potentially eligible consumers. Participants were asked about their awareness of the drug, their willingness to use such drugs, and their opinions on relevant treatment practices. RESULTS: Awareness of OTC simvastatin was high among primary care physicians but limited among consumers. Although OTC availability was preferred by pharmacists, consumers and GPs generally didn't think it was a good idea. GPs and pharmacists cited increased consumer choice as the most important likely benefit"";"" Consumers also considered potential savings for the National Health Service to be equally important. Medication abuse and neglect of lifestyle risk factors were unanimously considered the most important likely risks. Unlike the majority of pharmacists, most GPs felt that current dosing guidelines were inappropriate, but there was consensus that long-term non-compliance was likely to diminish any treatment benefit. Most respondents agreed that GPs should be informed when their patients are using OTC statins, but disagreed on how best to communicate this information. CONCLUSIONS: The OTC availability of statins did not appear to be viewed as a popular public health intervention by consumers and primary care physicians, as the drugs were generally viewed as prone to abuse. However, OTC availability was favored by pharmacists who saw it as empowering for both consumers and themselves. Key issues in the delivery, administration, and assessment of the public health impact of this intervention remain.",0,0,
1162,Lifetime prevalence of gender-based violence in women and the relationship to mental disorders and psychosocial functioning,"Context Physical violence by intimate partners, rape, sexual assault and stalking are ubiquitous and co-occurring forms of gender-based violence (GBV). An association between these forms of abuse and lifelong mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities in women needs to be explored. Objectives To assess the association of GBV and mental disorder, its severity and comorbidity, and psychosocial functioning in women. Design, Setting and Participants A cross-sectional study based on the 2007 Australian National Mental Health and Well-being Survey of 4451 women (65% response rate) aged 16 to 85 years. The World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 was used to assess the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders, anxiety, mood disorders, substance use disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Also included were indices of lifetime trauma exposure, including GBV, sociodemographic characteristics, economic status, family history of mental disorders, social support, general mental and physical functioning, quality of life, and general disability. Results A total of 1218 women (27.4%) reported having experienced at least 1 type of GBV. In women exposed to 3 or 4 types of GBV (n=139), the rate of mental disorders was 77.3% (odds ratio [OR], 10.06"", 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.85- 17.30) for anxiety disorders, 52.5% (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.31-5.60) for mood disorder, 47.1% (OR, 5.61; 95% CI, 3rd .46–9.10) for substance use disorder, 56.2% (OR, 15.90; 95% CI, 8.32–30.20) for PTSD, 89.4% (OR, 11.00; 95% CI , 5.46–22.17) for any mental disorder and 34.7% (OR, 14.80; 95% CI, 6.89–31.60) for attempted suicide Violence was associated with a more severe current mental disorder (OR, 4.60; 95% CI, 2.93-7.22), higher rates of 3 or more lifetime disorders (OR, 7.79; 95% CI, 6.10-9.95), physical disability (OR, 4.00, 95% CI, 1.82-8.82), intellectual disability (OR, 7.14; 95% CI, 2.87-17.75), impaired quality of life (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.60-5.47), an increase in sick leave days (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.43-4.05), and general disability (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1, 99-3:75.)

1163,"""Like Sugar and Honey"": The embedded ethics of a larval control project in The Gambia","This paper describes a malaria research project in The Gambia to stimulate reflection on the social value of transnational research. The Larval Control Project (LCP) investigated the effectiveness of a microbial insecticide in reducing vector density and ultimately clinical malaria in Gambian children. The LCP's protocol described a clinical surveillance program involving village health workers (VHWs) supported by project nurses. Combining insights from ethnographic fieldwork conducted at the Medical Research Council (MRC) laboratories in Farafenni from 2005 to 2009, open-ended interviews with project nurses, and eight focus group discussions held in October 2007 with participating mothers, we consider the social Effects of the The determination method of the LCP against the background of several years of research. We found that while participants associated the LCP with clinical care, they also viewed collaboration between the nurses and VHWs as an added value. Organized around the operational functions of the trial, small collaborations provided the platform from which local capacity could be built. While ethical guidelines emphasize the considerations that need to be added to experimental efforts in Southern countries (e.g., designing informed consent processes, developing strategies for community engagement, or providing therapeutic access to participants after study completion), These results suggest that attention from supplementing ethical protocols to daily research work - embedding ethics through scientific activity - may provide a more solid foundation to strengthen the relationship between scientific rigor and social value.",0,0,
1164,Limited effect of a multicenter intervention to improve the quality and efficiency of pneumonia care,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a multifactorial intervention to improve the quality, efficiency, and patient understanding of community-acquired pneumonia care. DESIGN: Times Series cohort study. SETTING: Four academic health centers in the New York City metropolitan area. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive adults hospitalized for pneumonia during a 5-month period before (n=1,013) and after (n=1,081) the implementation of a quality improvement (QI) initiative. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team of thought leaders developed evidence-based treatment guidelines and critical pathways, conducted educational sessions with physicians, distributed pocket-sized reminder cards, promoted standardized ordering, and developed bilingual patient education materials. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean age was 71.4 years and 44.1% of cases were low risk, 36.8% intermediate risk and 19.2% high risk. The pre- and post-intervention groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, race, nursing home residency, severity of pneumonia, first presentation, and most important comorbidities. The intervention increased the use of guideline-recommended antimicrobial therapy from 78.1% to 83.4% (p=0.003). There was also a borderline decrease in the proportion of patients discharged before becoming clinically stable, from 27.0 to 23.5% (p=0.06). However, there were no improvements in the other outcome measures, including time to first antibiotic dose, proportion of antibiotics received within 8 hours, timely switch to oral antibiotics, timely discharge, length of stay, or patient education outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This hands-on QI program was able to improve slightly on some quality indicators, but with no impact on resource use or patients' knowledge of their disease.

1165,Local clinical guidelines: description and evaluation of a participatory method for their development and implementation,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines are rarely followed by an immediate change in clinical behavior. We present our experiences with an active educational method for local development and implementation of a guideline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory method for developing local clinical guidelines. METHODS: A study in one district on the effect of guideline development involving active participation of intended recipients in subsequent relevant prescribing. It was conducted in the Wirral Family Health Services Authority District (Wirral Peninsula), which includes 69 general practices and covers a population of 345,763 residents. Using the method described, an exemplary guideline for “hypertension in old age” was developed. The main drug recommended was bendrofluazide 2.5 mg once daily. The differences in quarterly prescribed daily doses (PDD) of bendrofluazide 2.5 mg tablets per 1000 prescribing units (age-weighted population) between the intervention district and England as a whole were measured. RESULTS: The comparison of the intervention districts with the data from England shows a median difference of 122.49 PDD before and 206.34 PDD after the creation of the guideline, this change is statistically highly significant (Mann-Whitney Two-Tailed P < 0.0001"", 95 % CI = 36.51-104.77 Grouped regression analysis shows no significant difference (0.89) in slope gradients before guideline generation (P = 0.35, 95% CI = -3.97-5.76) , but the difference in the slope gradients after (12.95) is highly statistically significant (P < 0.0001; 95% CI = 8.17-17.73).The data suggest that the change in clinical behavior is at least two CONCLUSION: The participation of the intended general practitioners and local specialists in the development of a guideline through an active educational method as described was followed by a positive change in clinical behavior that lasted at least two years.",0,0,
1166,Local Learning Collaborations to Improve Quality in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): From Four Regional Practice-Based Research Networks (PBRNs),"BACKGROUND: Four practice-oriented research networks (PBRNs) participated in a project to increase the dissemination of evidence-based treatment guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD). A multi-component organizational intervention involved regionally nearby primary care practitioners in a series of facilitated meetings called Local Learning Collaborations (LLCs). METHODS: The 2-wave strategy began with 8 practices in each PBRN receiving practice facilitations and subsequently joining an LLC. A sequential mixed-methods design addressed the delivery, content, and accuracy of the intervention. Clinicians in 2 PBRNs participated in interviews, and PBRN coordinators reflected on implementation challenges. RESULTS: LLCs were formed in 3 PBRNs, with 121 monthly meetings held in 20 LLCs. Just over half of the participants were clinicians. Qualitative data suggest that clinicians increased the priority for CKD care, improved their knowledge and skills, were satisfied with the project, and attempted to improve care. Implementation challenges were identified and sustainability concerns were raised. CONCLUSION: While PBRNs can successfully use resources to disseminate treatment guidelines and LLCs are well accepted by clinical staff, establishing LLCs was not feasible for 1 PBRN and others struggled to meet regularly and performance data despite logistical support being available to have.",0,0,
1167,Long-term effectiveness in prescribing two multifaceted educational interventions: results from two large-scale randomized cluster studies,"INTRODUCTION: Information about the benefits and risks of drugs is a key element influencing physicians' prescribing decisions. Outreach visits to promote independent information have been shown to be moderately effective in changing prescribing behavior. OBJECTIVES: To test the short- and long-term effectiveness of pharmacist-led small group meetings in GP prescribing. METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, controlled cluster trials (RCTs) were conducted in a large-scale NHS setting. Ad hoc produced evidence-based material was used considering a therapeutic approach – TEA with informational materials on osteoporosis or prostatic hyperplasia – and a single drug oriented approach – SIDRO with informational materials on me-too drugs from 2 different classes: barnidipine or prulifloxacin. In each study, all 115 primary care groups in a northern Italian area (population 2.2 million, 1737 general practitioners) were randomized to small educational group meetings where available evidence was provided along with data on drug use and clinical scenarios. Main results were changes in the six-month prescription of targeted drugs. Long-term results (24 and 48 months) were also evaluated. RESULTS: In the TEA study, one of the four primary endpoints showed a reduction (prescribing of alfuzosin compared to tamsulosin and terazosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia: prescribing ratio -8.5%, p=0.03). Another primary endpoint (prescribing of risedronate) showed a reduction at 24 and 48 months (-7.6%, p=0.02"" and -9.8%, p=0.03), but not at six months ( -5.1%, p=0.36). In the SIDRO study, both primary endpoints showed a statistically significant reduction (barnidipine prescribing -9.8%, p=0.02; prulifloxacin prescribing -11.1% , p=0.04) that persisted or increased over time INTERPRETATION: These two cluster RCTs demonstrated the large-scale feasibility of a complex educational program in an NHS setting and its potentially relevant long-term implications for prescribing habits, particularly when the focus on a single drug National health systems should invest in independent drug information programs TRIALS REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN05866587.",0,0,

METHODS: Between 2009 and 2011, a cluster-randomized, controlled study with 16 occupational physicians (OT) and 523 employees in the Netherlands compared guideline-based care with usual OP care. The guideline-based mentoring consisted of (i) advising employers on how to assess and intervene in the obese work environment, (ii) conducting five face-to-face behavior change counseling sessions with employees to improve their lifestyle, and (iii) assessing the outcome and retention of Sections i and ii. Data were collected at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months of follow-up. Multi-level analyzes were carried out to evaluate the effects of the intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in waist circumference [beta 1.2 cm, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6-2.9], body weight (beta 0.3 kg, 95 % CI -1.0-1.6) found ), body mass index (beta 0.1 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.3-0.5), systolic blood pressure (beta 1.7 mmHG , 95% CI -2.4-5.8), diastolic blood pressure (beta 0.3 mmHG, 95% CI -1.0-0.6), cholesterol (beta 0 mmol/L, 95% CI -0, 2-0.2) or quality of life indicators at 18 months of follow-up.

1169,Long-term effects of asthma education for physicians on patient satisfaction and use of health services,"This randomized clinical study evaluated the long-term effects of an interactive seminar for physicians based on principles of self-regulation on clinical behavior, child asthma health care utilization and parental perceptions of physician performance. 74 general practitioners and 637 of their asthma patients aged 1-12 years were randomized to treatment or control. Children and parents were blind to the participation of physicians. Data were collected at baseline and at follow-up through self-administered surveys (paediatricians), telephone interviews (parents), and medical records. The seminar focused on the development of communication and teaching skills and the application of therapeutic medical therapies for asthma as outlined in the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. Approximately 2 years after the intervention, physicians in the treatment group were more likely than control physicians to: use asthma education protocols (odds ratio (OR) 4.9, p=0.2), write the patient how medications are adjusted when symptoms change (OR 5.7, p=0.05) and provide further guidelines for adjusting therapy (OR 3.8, p=0.06). The parents rated the doctors in the treatment group better than the control doctors for five specific positive communication behaviors. Children seen by physicians in the treatment group had fewer hospital admissions (p=0.03), and children with higher emergency department (ED) utilization at baseline had fewer subsequent visits to the emergency department (p=0.03). No differences were found in the number of doctor visits. No significant differences were found between the treatment and control group physicians in terms of the time they spent with patients at doctor visits (26 versus 29 minutes) or in the number of patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs. It is concluded that interactive asthma workshops for pediatricians had a significant long-term benefit in their asthma care.",0,0,

METHODS: Prospective discontinuous time-series study evaluating the efficacy of a multifaceted, staged intervention over 4 years in a large urban pediatric referral hospital. Safe pediatric prescribing guidelines were implemented using an evidence-based model. Key components included early clinician engagement and enhanced multidisciplinary communication, consensus development, interactive education, and timely data feedback through iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The impact on medication errors and harms (adverse drug events, [ADEs]) were measured using standard definitions and a multi-method approach. Prospective data from voluntary reports from nurses, physicians and pharmacists and an intensive medical record review were combined. All data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel, including ADR causality assessments. RESULTS: Over 3 periods, 1011 patients with 6651 drug prescriptions were reviewed. The total number of ADEs decreased by >50% in the first year and this was maintained at 4 years. The greatest improvements were in potential ADEs, which decreased from 12.26 per 100 patients at baseline to 4.60 per 100 patients at 4 years (p<0.05). Overall medication errors decreased from 4.51 per 100 orders at baseline to 2.78 per 100 orders at 4 years (p<0.05). Prescribing errors decreased by 65%, from 4.07 per 100 orders at baseline to 2.05 orders at 4 years (p<0.05).

1171,Look for gallbladder disease in the patient's iris,"In alternative healthcare, iridology is used as a diagnostic tool. The diagnosis of gallbladder disease was used to examine its validity and interperformer consistency. The presence of an inflamed gallbladder with gallstones should be easily recognized by certain signs in the lower lateral part of the iris of the right eye. Stereo color slides were made of the right eye. Color stereo slides were prepared from the right eyes of 39 patients with the disease and 39 age-matched controls. The slides were randomly presented to five leading iridologists without additional information. The prevalence of the disease has been estimated at 56%. The median validity was 51% with 54% sensitivity and 52% specificity. These results were close to chance validity (iota = 0.03). None of the iridologists achieved high validity. The median interperformer consistency was 60%. This was only slightly higher than chance consistency (kappa = 0.18). This study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic tool.",0,0,

1175,Making comparative performance information more understandable: An experimental assessment of the impact of formats on consumer understanding,"Study objectives We wanted to investigate how different presentation formats affect consumers' understanding and use of comparative performance information (CPI). Methods An experimental between-subjects and within-subjects design with manipulations of CPI presentation formats. We enrolled both consumers with lower socioeconomic status (SES)/cognitive skills and consumers with higher SES/cognitive skills recruited via an online access panel. Respondents received fictitious CPIs and answered questions about interpretation and information usage. Between the subjects we tested, (1) showed an overall performance score (yes/no)""; (2) showed a small number of quality indicators (5 vs. 9);"" and (3) displaying various types of rating symbols (rating stars, colored dots, and word symbols versus numbers and bar graphs). Within subjects, we tested the effect of a reduced number of healthcare providers (5 vs. 20). Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, and paired-samples t-test. Results A total of 902 (43%) respondents participated. The display of an overall performance rating and the use of colored dots and word symbols particularly improved consumer understanding. Importantly, respondents marked with colored dots were the most likely to correctly select the top three healthcare providers (84.3%) compared to word symbols (76.6% correct), star ratings (70.6% correct), numbers (62.0 %) and bars (54.2%). when looking at the performance figures of 20 providers. In addition, a smaller number of healthcare providers appeared to be supportive of consumers, for example 69.5% of 20 providers correctly selected the top three compared to 80.2% of five providers. Discussion Certain presentation formats improved consumer understanding of CPI, most notably the use of overall performance scores, word symbols and colored dots, and a reduced number of vendors displayed. Public reports should use these formats to maximize consumer impact.",0,0,

1178,"Making the invisible visible: a qualitative study of radiologist values, attitudes and norms regarding radiation protection","Some safety deficiencies were found during inspections of Swedish radiology departments by the Swedish Radiation Protection Agency, which perform 5.4 million radiological examinations and 100,000 nuclear scans annually. To ensure safety in the healthcare system and to build a strong radiation protection environment for patients (and staff), a strong safety culture must be in place. In order to understand an organization's behavior, decisions and actions, it is important to study its cultural values. The aim of this study was to discuss how values, attitudes and norms affect the decisions of radiologists and how they influence the implementation of various radiation protection measures. To investigate this, focus group interviews and in-depth individual interviews were conducted in a sample from a range of radiology departments in hospitals in Sweden. The results show that the core value was derived from the patient's perspective, with a focus on knowing that they came to the healthcare system for a specific reason: to discover a disease or, at best, to be declared healthy. Most of the settings were based on experience related to aspects that the radiologist could not influence. This often relates to the increased pressure on radiological examinations from the clinics in the various operating units. Under the concept of standards, the radiologists in the study called for the development of regulations and guidelines to be linked to justification questions for various radiological issues.",0,0,
1179,"Malaria policy versus practices, a reality check from Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo","BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) after a confirmed parasitological diagnosis is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Congolese National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). However, the commitment and competence of all stakeholders (patients, healthcare professionals, governments and funders) is required to achieve effective case management and ensure the ""therapeutic useful life"" of the recommended drugs. The health-oriented behavior of patients and the practices of medical professionals for the treatment of malaria were evaluated. METHODS: This was an observational study embedded in a two-stage randomized cluster survey conducted at a health center (HC) in each of the 12 selected health zones in the city of Kinshasa. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of malaria were eligible. Their health-oriented behavior was recorded in a special questionnaire, as was the practice of alternative practitioners. The latter were unaware that their practices would be judged. RESULTS: Six hundred and twenty-four patients were studied, of whom 136 (21.8%) were younger than five years. Three hundred and thirty-five (55%) had been taking medication (self-medication with any product or visiting another HC) prior to the current consultation, of whom 47 (14%) were taking an antimalarial medication and 56 (9%) were presumptively treated. Of these, 53.6% received monotherapy with either quinine, artesunate, phytopharmaceuticals, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or amodiaquine. On the other hand, monotherapy was prescribed in 39.9% of confirmed malaria cases when doctors were informed of the laboratory results. Only 285 patients (45.7%) were treated according to WHO and NMCP guidelines, of whom 120 (19.2%) were prescribed an appropriate comparator therapy after a positive blood smear and 165 (26.4%) after a negative result received no antimalarials. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the discrepancy between malaria policy and field reality in Kinshasa in terms of patient health-oriented behavior and health-care worker practices. Consequently, poor adherence to guidelines may contribute to the development and spread of antimalarial drug resistance and also negatively impact disease burden.",0,0,

The Acute Coronary Syndrome Discharge Management project used a quality improvement approach with targeted intervention strategies to optimize: prescribing of guideline-recommended drugs, education about lifestyle changes including cardiac rehabilitation (CR), and communication between hospital staff, patients and general practitioners. Hospitals across Australia participated in a quality improvement cycle of audit, feedback, intervention and re-audit. Interventions included training meetings, academic detailing and point-of-care reminders, and feedback on exit audit results. Outcome measurements included prescription of guidelines -Recommended medication, referral to CR, and documentation and communication of the management plan. At baseline, 49 hospitals recruited 1,545 patients, and after the intervention, 45 hospitals remained active in the project and recruited 1,589 patients. 3,044 hospital staff attended the group education or academic details sessions. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in the prescription of all four guideline-recommended drugs (69% vs. 57%; p<0.0001); short-acting nitrates (68% vs. 56%; p<0.0001); and documented referral to CR (68% vs. 57%; p<0.0001).

The obesity epidemic is driving the diabetes epidemic to alarming levels and primary care is becoming an important environment for obesity management in T2DM in India. Still, many primary care physicians feel ill-equipped or under-supported to address obesity in patients with diabetes. This article provides an overview of the latest and strongest evidence-based strategies that can help physicians manage obesity in patients with T2DM in primary care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE using the search terms obesity, obesity in T2DM, weight loss and primary care. The websites of the American Diabetes Association, the National Institute for Health, the National Institute of Health and Excellence (NICE), the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the World Health Organization were also searched.

AIM: To describe barriers to the management of persistent pain in older adults, summarize current treatment approaches including pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities, present rehabilitative approaches, and highlight aspects of the patient-physician relationship that may help improve patient outcomes. This review is relevant to physicians seeking an age-appropriate approach to providing pain management to older adults Evidence Collection: Search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane database from January 1990 to May 2014 using the search terms ""older adults"", ""senior"", "" Age 65 and older”. , elderly and elderly along with non-cancerous pain, chronic pain, persistent pain, pain management, intractable pain and refractory pain to identify English-language peer-reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, consensus statements and guidelines relevant to treatment persistent pain in older adults RESULTS: Of the 92 studies identified, 35 evaluated pharmacological interventions while 57 evaluated non-pharmacological modalities;"" the majority (n=50) focused on older adults with osteoarthritis. This evidence base supports a stepwise approach with acetaminophen as first-line therapy If treatment goals are not met, a trial of a topical NSAID, tramadol, or both is recommended Oral NSAIDs are not recommended for long-term use Careful monitoring Attention to monitoring for toxicity and efficacy is crucial as the risk of side effects increases with age. A multimodal approach is strongly recommended - with an emphasis on a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, including physical and occupational rehabilitation, as well as cognitive-behavioural and movement-based interventions. An integrated pain management approach is ideally achieved by cultivating a strong therapeutic alliance between the elderly patient and the physician. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Treatment planning for persistent pain later in life requires a clear understanding of treatment goals and expectations, comorbidities, and the patient's cognitive and functional status, as well as coordination of community resources and family support when available.

The objective was to assess the difference between observed clinical management and benchmark care, defined by the 1997 National Agency for Accreditation and Health Evaluation (ANAES) guidelines, at baseline (May 1999) and during the program (November 1999). measure to detect any changes in clinical management between the two study periods, with the time frame corresponding to the intervention period. METHODS: The patient samples used in the two studies were from partners between the ages of 20 and 80 years living in France or one of its overseas territories who were recently exempted from the co-payment (ETM) for severe hypertension (these patients will become 100% reimbursed for all care related to the illness). The evaluation was based on retrospective information from the treating physicians. The indicators isolated to compare the two study periods were blood pressure control, suggested lifestyle changes, and prescribed medications. RESULTS: The first survey took place between May and November 1999 and included 10,665 patients (corresponding to a weighted patient population of 50,383), while the second in November 2000 examined 2,649 patients. The study population in 1999 was on average younger than the study population in November 2000: 63.1 years +/- 0.2 vs. 65.4 years +/- 0.4. Almost two out of three patients had at least one other important cardiovascular risk factor in addition to HBP (cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia): 63.9% in 1999 and 64.4% in 2000. Almost every seventh patient had concomitant coronary artery disease: 14.1% in 1999 and 15.3% in 2000 and more than one in ten had associated cerebrovascular disease: 12.7% in 1999 and 12.2% in 2000. In the 1999 group there were more diabetics than in the 2000 group: 27.5% +/- 1.0 versus 23.9% +/- 1.6. The proportion of patients with poorly controlled blood pressure (systolic > 140 mmHg or > 160 mmHg in those aged 60-80 years with isolated systolic hypertension or diastolic > 90 mmHg) did not change: 46.8% +/- 1.1 Zoll 1999 and 45.7% +/- 1.9 in 2000. Using guideline recommendations for diabetics (BP < 130/85). 85.4% of diabetics were poorly controlled in 1999 and 86.6% in 2000. Similarly, in hypertensive patients with renal failure (guideline recommendations: <125/75 mmHg), 94.5% in 1999 and 96.3% in 2000 were poorly controlled. Recommended lifestyle changes (reduction in salt intake, weight loss, lower alcohol consumption, increased physical activity) were not well tracked in either study: in 1999, fewer than a quarter of patients fully implemented the desired changes (23.7%), although this was only the The case was In 2000 it was 24.5%. In 1999, physicians prescribed specifically indicated therapeutic agents for 68.0% of patients and in 2000 for 67.6% of patients, taking into account concomitant diseases. The prescriptions contained a potentially contraindicated drug in 27.3% of the cases in 1999 and in 28.0% of the cases in 2000. CONCLUSION: A comparison of the results of the two surveys from the years 1999 and 2000 on the treatment of patients with severe hypertension was not significant Detect differences in blood d pressure control or treatment modalities. Without questioning the value of health insurance interventions, these results highlight how difficult it is to change clinical practice in a short period of time, especially in a disorder that involves a number of different elements, including individual patient behavior . In order to significantly improve clinical management, it will probably be necessary to continue the dialogue between medical advisers of the health insurance funds (medecins conseils) and clinicians and to renew campaigns aimed at empowering patients.",0,0,
1192,Management of severe sepsis in patients admitted to Asian intensive care units: prospective cohort study,"OBJECTIVES To assess the adherence of Asian ICUs and hospitals to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's resuscitation and treatment packages. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of compliance on mortality and the organizational characteristics of hospitals associated with higher levels of compliance. DESIGN Prospective cohort study. RECRUITMENT 150 intensive care units in 16 Asian countries. PARTICIPANTS 1285 adult patients with severe sepsis were admitted to these intensive care units in July 2009. The organizational characteristics of the participating centers, patient baseline characteristics, achievement of goals within the resuscitation and treatment packages, and outcome data were recorded. KEY OUTCOME MEASURE Compliance with Surviving Sepsis Campaign resuscitation (six hours) and management (24 hours) packages. RESULTS The in-hospital mortality rate was 44.5% (572/1285). The compliance rates for the resuscitation and management packages were 7.6% (98/1285) and 3.5% (45/1285), respectively. On logistic regression analysis, compliance with the following bundle goals independently predicted reduced mortality: blood cultures (achieved in 803/1285); 62.5%, 95% CI 59.8% to 65.1%), broad spectrum antibiotics (reached in 821/1285; 63.9%, 61.3% to 66.5%) and central venous pressure (reached in 345/ 870; 39.7%, 36.4% to 42.9%). High-income countries, university hospitals, ICUs with an accredited fellowship program, and surgical ICUs were more likely to fulfill the resuscitation package. CONCLUSIONS While mortality in severe sepsis is high, compliance with resuscitation and treatment packages is generally poor in much of Asia. Because the centers included in this study may not be fully representative, the reported success rates may overestimate the true level of adherence to recommended treatment and should be interpreted with caution. Achieving goals for blood cultures, antibiotics, and central venous pressure was independently associated with improved survival.",0,1,

1194,Dealing with anxiety associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the emergency setting,"INTRODUCTION: Patient anxiety presents a significant challenge in the Emergency Department (ED), an environment where medical staff work under pressure and deal with a wide variety of medical emergencies. The potential for escalation into aggressive behavior that puts patients, staff and others at risk makes it imperative to address agitated behavior quickly and efficiently. Time constraints and limited access to specialized psychiatric support have historically led to the 'restrain and reassure' strategy which was believed to represent the optimal approach'; However, there is increasing recognition that more patient-centred approaches lead to better outcomes. The goal of this review is to raise awareness of best practices for management of agitation in the emergency department and to consider the role of new pharmacological interventions in this setting. DISCUSSION: The Best Practices in Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation (BETA) guidelines address the full management of agitation, including triage, diagnosis, interpersonal calming skills, and drug selection. Since their publication in 2012, pharmacological approaches to managing agitation have evolved, including both new agents and new dosage forms, expanding the options available to both patients and physicians. Newer modes of administration that may be useful in the rapid management of agitation include inhaled, buccal/sublingual, and intranasal formulations. To date, inhaled loxapine is the only formulation administered via a non-intramuscular route with a specific indication for agitation associated with bipolar or schizophrenia. Although non-invasive formulations require patient collaboration, they have the potential to improve the overall patient experience and thereby improve future collaboration between patients and healthcare providers. CONCLUSION: Management of agitation in the ED should include a patient-centered approach that includes non-pharmacological approaches whenever possible. If pharmacologic intervention is required, a collaborative approach using noninvasive drugs should be used whenever possible.",0,0,
1195,Managing pain in high-risk patients in a patient-centered medical home,"Despite remarkable advances in diagnostics, pharmacotherapy and invasive and non-invasive interventions, chronic pain remains a major health problem. The prevalence of chronic pain in the United States is staggering and increasing, and the personal and societal costs are not inconsiderable. The etiology of pain is complex, and individuals suffering from chronic pain tend to have significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, and in some cases, substance use disorders. There is great concern about the rising rate of misuse/abuse of prescription opioids for both non-medical use and among pain patients receiving chronic opioid therapy. While there is an ongoing debate about the ""true"" incidence of opioid abuse in the pain population, patients affected by both pain and substance use disorders clearly pose a particular challenge. The majority of patients with chronic pain, including those with co-occurring substance use disorders, are treated in primary care. GPs have limited time, resources, and training to effectively assess, treat, and monitor these complicated cases. A number of evidence- and consensus-based treatment guidelines for opioid therapy and risk reduction have been developed, but have been underutilized in both specialty and primary care clinics.

1197,Dealing with perceived conflicts of interest while ensuring the continuous innovation of medical technology,"Without the ongoing collaboration between vascular surgeons and the medical device industry, many of these advanced treatments used daily in vascular interventional surgery would not exist. The flip side of this coin is that these vital relationships create multiple roles for surgeons and must be managed accordingly. The dynamic process of innovation along with factors such as refinement of product delivery technology, education, testing and clinical trials, and product support necessitate continuous and close collaboration between surgeons and the device industry. This unique relationship sometimes leads to perceptions of conflicts of interest for physicians, in part because the competitive pressures of the multiple, overlapping roles of clinician/carer/investigator/innovator/client are significant. To address this issue, the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), the nation's largest medical technology association representing medical device and diagnostics companies, has developed a code of ethics designed to guide medical technology companies in their interactions with healthcare professionals. First introduced in 1993, the AdvaMed Code strongly encourages both industry and physicians to commit to openness and high ethical standards in conducting their business relationships. The AdvaMed Code addresses many types of interactions that may occur between companies and healthcare professionals, including training, consulting contracts, the provision of demonstration and evaluation units, and charitable donations. By complying with the Code, companies are sending a strong signal that treatment decisions must always be made in the best interests of the patient.",0,0,
1198,Dealing with urinary incontinence in stroke rehabilitation - an overview,"BACKGROUND: Post-stroke urinary incontinence is a pervasive problem for patients and their families, affecting well-being and future care. There are many therapeutic interventions, but their effectiveness is not known in detail. The question for rehabilitation practice is how best to treat urinary incontinence (UI) in a way that does not interfere with patients' daily lives. Method: The search for clinical studies was performed in PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Library, limited to German and English language publications published between 1989 and April 2005. Medical, nursing, and physiotherapeutic interventions for the treatment of post-stroke UI were described and analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical trials were divided into process-oriented trials and those investigating individual interventions. The process tests could be divided into three different groups with an overall success rate of 82-95%, 50-56% and 23-36%. Behavioral methods (caregiver-induced, patient-active, and other interventions) and medical interventions are available. The studies of the most successful group include staff training and application of interventions based on an assessment process and guideline. No clinical study on individual interventions came to a conclusion like the process-oriented studies. CONCLUSION: Treatment of urinary incontinence requires a multimodal approach: specific training of nurses, application and action in a problem-solving process, such as the rehabilitation cycle, and care based on an assessment process and guidelines. The development of a guideline for the treatment of urinary incontinence after a stroke can be recommended. Further research on the effectiveness of individual interventions is needed.",0,0,

Eligible physicians received performance targets for three quality measures every six months. The incentive payments could be as high as 2 percent of a doctor's annual income. Over thirteen six-month periods, the program used 130 different quality measures. Although improvements in quality of care and cost reductions have been difficult to calculate, anecdotal evidence points to multiple successes. For example, the program helped physicians meet many federal criteria for the wise use of health information technology and resulted in $15.5 million in award payments. The program also facilitated the introduction of an electronic health record, improved hand hygiene compliance, increased efficiencies in radiology and cancer centers, and reduced emergency room utilization. The program has shown that even small incentives, tied to carefully structured metrics, prioritization and clear communication, can help change the behavior of employed physicians in a way that improves the quality and safety of healthcare and reduces the sense of administrative burden to the doctors is reduced.",0,1,
1201,MASTER PLAN: Study of the role of nurses in a multifactorial intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Normally, nephrologists are primarily responsible for the care of CKD patients. However, in many cases treatment goals as formulated in guidelines are not achieved. The addition of a nurse could improve the quality of care. The Multifactorial Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal Patients with the Aid of Nurse Practitioners (MASTERPLAN) study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study that aims to investigate whether a multifactorial approach can be used in patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (Stage 3 and 4) treatment enables targets using both a multi-drug strategy and lifestyle treatment, either with or without the addition of a nurse, reduce cardiovascular risk and slow renal function decline. Patients (n=793) were randomly assigned to nursing or medical care. In the nursing arm of the study, nurses use flowcharts to address risk factors that require medication and/or lifestyle changes. They have been trained to coach patients through motivational talks with the aim of improving patient self-management. At baseline, both treatment groups show equal distributions for key study variables. Furthermore, only one patient had all risk factors within the limits defined in various guidelines, underscoring the relevance of our initiative.",0,0,
1202,Maternal dietary habits and physical activity habits during the postpartum period: associations with clinical counseling in a sample of Australian first-time mothers,"BACKGROUND: Numerous health benefits are associated with achieving optimal diet and exercise habits during and after pregnancy. Understanding predictors of these behaviors is an important public health consideration, but little is known about associations between medical advice and diet and physical activity behaviors in women after childbirth. The aims of this study were to compare the frequency of diet and physical activity advice given by physicians during and after pregnancy and to assess whether this advice is related to postpartum diet and exercise behaviors. METHODS: Primiparous mothers (n=448) participating in the Melbourne InFANT Extend study completed the Cancer Council of Australia's Food Frequency Questionnaire at three to four months of age postpartum, which measured usual fruit and vegetable intake ( servings/day). Total physical activity time, time spent walking, and time engaged in both moderate and vigorous activity in the previous week (min/week) were assessed using the Active Australia survey. Counseling received during and after pregnancy was assessed using separate survey items asking whether a health practitioner had discussed healthy eating and physical activity. Linear and logistic regression examined the associations of advice with food intake and physical activity. RESULTS: Overall, 8.6% of women met the guidelines for combining fruit and vegetables. Overall, the mean physical activity time was 350.9 +/- 281.1 min/week. Time spent walking (251.97 +/- 196.78 min/week) was longer than time spent with moderate (36.68 +/- 88.58 min/week) or vigorous activity (61.74 + /- 109.96 min/week) and 63.2% of women were compliant with physical activity recommendations. The majority of women reported receiving advice on healthy eating (87.1%) and physical activity (82.8%) during pregnancy. Fewer women reported receiving advice on healthy eating (47.5%) and physical activity (51.9%) up to three months after giving birth. No significant association was found between the provision of dietary and/or physical activity counseling and maternal food intake or level of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Advice on healthy eating and physical activity was received less after pregnancy than during pregnancy, but no association was observed between receiving advice and behavior. More intensive approaches than providing advice may be needed to promote healthy eating and physical activity among new mothers.

1203,McMaster PLUS: a cluster-randomized clinical trial of an intervention to accelerate the clinical use of evidence-based information from digital libraries,"Background: Physicians struggle to keep up with new discoveries from medical research. Methods: We developed the McMaster Premium Literature Service (PLUS), a web-based supplement to an existing digital library that provides physicians with quality and relevance-rated medical literature tailored to their clinical disciplines. We evaluated PLUS in a cluster-randomized study with 203 participating physicians in Northern Ontario and compared a full-serve version (which included new article alerts and a cumulative database of alerts) with a self-serve version (which included a passive guide to evidence-based literature). Service use was the primary study endpoint. Results: Average library logins increased by 0.77 logins/month/user (95% CI 0.43, 1.11) in the full-serve group compared to the self-serve group. The proportion of full-serve participants using the service in each month of the study period increased sustainably during the intervention period, with a relative increase of 57% (95% CI 12, 123) compared to the self-serve group. There were no differences in these proportions during the baseline period, and after the transition from the self-serve group to full-serve, the usage of the self-serve group became indistinguishable from that of the full-serve group (relative difference 4 .4 (95%) CI -23.7, 43.0) Even during the intervention and crossover periods, the measures of self-reported utility showed no difference between the two groups. Conclusion: A quality and relevant online literature service increased utilization evidence-based literature information from a digital library of practicing physicians.",0,1,
1204,Measures to assess the change of practice among doctors,"BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of randomized trials and systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of interventions aimed at inducing change in clinical practice. The results of this research will be used to guide strategies to improve the uptake of evidence into clinical practice. Knowledge of the outcomes measured by these studies is crucial not only for the interpretation and application of the work done to date, but also to inform future research in this expanding field and to aid in the compilation of the results in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. METHODS: The aim of this review was to identify methods used to measure changes in clinical practice by healthcare professionals following an intervention aimed at improving the uptake of evidence into practice. All published studies included in a recent comprehensive health technology assessment of clinical practice guideline implementation and clinical practice change interventions (n=228) comprised the sample for this study. Using a standardized data extraction form, one reviewer (SH) extracted the relevant information from the methods and/or results sections of the studies. RESULTS: Measures of change in health practitioner behavior were the most common, with 88.8% of studies using them as outcome measures. Measures that assessed patient-level change, either actual measures of change or surrogate measures of change, were used in 28.8% and 36.7% of the studies, respectively. 22.8% of the studies assessed the knowledge and attitudes of health professionals and 17.6% assessed changes at the organizational level. CONCLUSION: Most studies of interventions aimed at changing clinical practice have measured the effect of the intervention at the physician level, ie has the physician changed what he is doing, or has his knowledge and/or attitude changed changed to this practice? Less than a third of the studies measured resulted in a change in the ultimate endpoint of the patient's health status, whether or not the practice was changed.",0,0,

METHODS: Medical record summaries and patient/parent interviews were used to conduct pre- and post-intervention comparisons of patients at 9 sites who participated in the assessment of a Breakthrough Series (BTS) collaboration on asthma care with patients at 4 matched control sites. Vicinity. â€”Thirteen primary care clinics. patients. - 385 asthmatic children treated in an intervention clinic and 126 treated in a control clinic (response rate = 76%). Intervention. â€“ Three 2-day training sessions for quality improvement teams from participating sites, followed by 3 â€œactionâ€ periods over the course of a year. Results: The overall process of asthma care improved significantly in the intervention group but remained unchanged in the control group (change in process score +13% vs. 0%; p<0.0001). Patients in the intervention group were more likely than patients in the control group to monitor their peak flows (70% vs. 43%; p<0.0001) and to have a written action plan (41% vs. 22%; p=0.001) . better general health-related quality of life (scale score 80 vs. 77; p=0.05) and asthma-specific quality of life related to treatment problems (scale score 89 vs. 85; p<0.05).

1208,Measuring the effectiveness of mentoring as a knowledge translation intervention to implement empirical evidence: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Mentoring as a knowledge translation (KT) intervention uses social influence among health professionals to increase the use of evidence in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of mentoring as a KT intervention aimed at improving the use of evidence by healthcare professionals in clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using electronic databases (eg, MEDLINE, CINAHL), gray literature, and manual searches. Eligible studies evaluated mentoring of healthcare professionals responsible for patient care to improve the uptake of evidence into practice. Mentoring is defined as (a) a mentor who has more experience than a mentee; (b) individual support based on the needs of the mentee;"" and (c) engage in an interpersonal relationship characterized by mutual benefit, commitment and commitment. Two reviewers independently screened citations for suitability, extracted data, and assessed study quality. The data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Out of 10,669 citations from 1988 to 2012, 10 studies were eligible. Mentoring as a KT intervention has been evaluated in Canada, the US and Australia. Exposure to mentoring compared to no mentoring improved some behavioral outcomes (one study). Compared to controls or other multifaceted interventions, multifaceted interventions with mentoring improved practitioner knowledge (four of five studies), beliefs (four of six studies), and impact on organizational outcomes (three of four studies). There were mixed results regarding changes in professional behavior and impact on physician and patient outcomes: some outcomes improved while others showed no difference. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTIONS: Only one study evaluated the effectiveness of mentoring alone as a KT intervention, showing improvement in some behavioral outcomes. The other nine studies that assessed the effectiveness of mentoring as part of a multifaceted intervention showed mixed results, making it difficult to determine the additive effect of mentoring. Further research is needed to identify effective mentoring as a KT intervention.",0,0,
1209,Measuring the impact of reminders of outpatient influenza vaccination at the time of the clinical opportunity,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of computerized influenza vaccination reminders on individual clinician behavior at each clinical occasion. DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective study of physicians' influenza vaccination behavior over four years. About half of the physicians in an internal medicine clinic used a computerized medical record system (CPR users) that generated computerized reminders. The other clinicians used traditional paper records (PR users). MEASUREMENTS: Any non-acute visit to a patient who was eligible for influenza vaccination was considered an opportunity for intervention. Patients with contraindications to vaccination were excluded. Compliance with the guideline was defined as documentation that a clinician ordered the vaccine, advised the patient about the vaccine, offered the vaccine to a patient who refused it, or confirmed that the patient received the vaccine elsewhere. The authors calculated the proportion of occasions each clinician documented actions in the CPR and PR user groups. RESULTS: The CPR and PR user groups had different baseline compliance rates (40.1 and 27.9 percent, respectively); P<0.05). Both rates remained stable over a two-year baseline period (P=0.34 and P=0.47, respectively). Compliance rates in the CPR user group increased by 78 percent from baseline (P<0.001), while rates for the PR user group did not change significantly (P=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians who used CPR with reminders had a higher documentation rate of adherence to influenza vaccination guidelines than those who used a paper record. Measurements of individual clinical behavior at the time of each clinical opportunity can provide an accurate assessment of interventions aimed at improving compliance.",0,1,

1211,Medical care of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the light of international and national recommendations: a retrospective analysis,"SUPPORTED QUESTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2Dm) is a chronic disease with a major economic impact. In 2009, the Swiss Society for Endocrinology and Diabetes (SSED) published recommendations for the treatment of T2Dm. In Switzerland, little data is currently available on metabolic control and physician compliance with treatment guidelines. Our aim was to examine clinical care in T2Dm in the year after publication of the SSED recommendations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical histories of all patients with T2Dm admitted to our general practice clinic in 2009. Metabolic control was assessed by glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Antidiabetic therapy was analyzed and the frequency of screening for end-organ damage was examined. A group with newly diagnosed T2Dm was analyzed separately from patients with known T2Dm at admission. RESULTS: In patients with known T2Dm, the mean (+/- standard deviation) HbA1c was 7.66% +/- 1.73%. Only 44% of the patients had an HbA1c value of 8.5%, the proportion of patients treated with insulin increased from 49% at admission to 76% at discharge. Only half of the patients received a lifestyle intervention in the year before admission or during the hospital stay. Screening for diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy was performed in approximately one-third and two-thirds of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of unselected T2Dm patients admitted to our hospital had suboptimal metabolic control. The implementation of treatment recommendations by general practitioners and hospitals should be improved.",0,0,
1212,Medical communication and technology: A video-based process study on the use of decision-making aids in general practitioner consultations,"BACKGROUND: Much research on healthcare decision making has focused on counseling outcomes. What is less well known is the process by which clinicians and patients arrive at treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe the behavior of physicians and patients during primary care consultations when three types of decision aids were used to support treatment decisions in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A video-based study as part of an efficacy study that compared the use of paper-based guidelines (control) versus two forms of computer-assisted decision support (implicit and explicit versions of DARTS II). The treatment decision was for anticoagulation with warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation. Twenty-nine consultations were videotaped. A 10-minute ""snippet"" of the consultation was sampled for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocols for verbal behavior and ethological techniques for non-verbal behavior. RESULTS: Median consultation times (quartiles) differed significantly depending on the technology used. Working through paper-based guidelines took 21 (19-26) minutes compared to 31 (16-41) minutes for the implicit tool and 44 (39-55) minutes for the explicit tool. Primary care physicians dominated in the ten minutes immediately before the decision point the conversation and accounted for 64% (58-66%) of all utterances, and this trend was similar in all three arms of the study. Giving information was the most common activity for both GPs and patients, although GPs compared to Patients twice as likely and more likely to consult with computer-assisted decision support. GPs used highly technical language and only 7% of their conversations had socio-emotional content;"" this was half of the socio-emotional content the patients displayed (15%). However, frequent head nods and close mirroring in line of sight indicated that both parties actively participated in these deliberations. But even in consultations aimed at promoting shared decision-making, GPs were verbally dominant and acted mainly as information providers to patients. In addition, computer-aided decision-making aids lengthened the deliberations considerably, especially in the later phases. These data suggest that decision aids may not result in more 'sharing' in the treatment decision and that, in their current form, they may be taking too long to be negotiated for use in routine primary care.",0,0,
1213,Medical diagnosis through semiotics: Giving meaning to the sign,"Physicians are busy incorporating quantitative methods for making clinical decisions into their practice. An occupation with semiotics, the theory of signs, can complement this project. A sign stands for something. We communicate indirectly through signs, and by interpreting what signs mean, we understand our world and diagnose and understand our patients. Thus, through association and inference, we turn flowers into love, Othello into jealousy, and staring eyes into thyrotoxicosis. Characteristically, upon diagnosis, beginning with an unstable conclusion, we test and ask questions that are likely to produce evidence to support (or discredit) ours. Hypothesis. In a literary sense, we join with the author to clarify and rewrite the text""; creative interpretation is key. The diagnosis is completed through the narrative, through the meaning revealed through the telling of the patient's story . Diagnosis will succeed only to the extent that we respect the principles and caveats of sign interpretation. The sign is both the key to the unknown and the master imitator. The sign and its meaning are usually not the same;"" meaning must Because interpretations are subjective, they are limited by the experience and bias of the practitioner, and the contexts in which the sign appears shape and can change the meaning of the sign altogether.",0,0,

1217,Medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia: physician and patient preferences and satisfaction,"Practice guidelines recognize the importance of patient preferences in determining the appropriate treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Recent literature suggests that patient and physician perspectives and satisfaction with BPH treatment management may differ"";"" this may impact clinical outcomes and patient compliance. This review evaluates patients' and physicians' preferred treatment options for treating BPH and patient satisfaction with therapy. A Medline-based systematic review was conducted using the terms 'benign prostatic hyperplasia' + 'patient preference/perception/satisfaction' or 'doctor/urologist preference/perception'. Patients prefer therapies that affect the long-term course of the disease over those that produce a short-term improvement in symptoms, contrary to what their physicians believe. The prescription behavior of urologists and general practitioners can be very different. Studies of patient satisfaction with specific treatments generally show high levels of overall satisfaction, but cross-study comparisons are limited due to study design heterogeneity. Evidence to date suggests that the views and beliefs of patients and their doctor may not always coincide. Improved communication between doctor and patient will help determine the best treatment option for patients with BPH and can ensure better compliance and treatment success.",0,0,

1222,"Merging the perspectives of regulators, pharmaceutical industry and US payers to improve approaches to treatment effect heterogeneity in research and practice","Effective pursuit of the science and management of treatment effect heterogeneity (HTE) relies on mutual understanding of perspectives and collaboration among the diverse healthcare stakeholders. In this article, we compare, contrast, and seek to find areas of agreement between the perspectives of three such stakeholders - regulators, the biopharmaceutical and device industry, and US payers. First, we discuss how evidence for HTE is generated and how it could be improved. In pharmaceuticals, much of the initial research is performed by the pharmaceutical industry, which is guided by basic research but also limited by potential markets, regulatory approval requirements, study size considerations, and payer expectations of proof of value. Once a drug is commercialized, further evidence can be generated by combining study data, performing meta-analysis, and analyzing real-world results through observational research designs."";"" We examine how these efforts can benefit from collaboration between these stakeholders. Second, we discuss the equally important use of HTE evidence to enable physicians and patients to access and benefit from the evidence from this research. Research results need to be translated into actionable information and guidelines that can be incorporated into daily practice. This requires interaction and collaboration between all stakeholders, based on facilitated communication and further evaluation research. We present examples of several cross-sectoral initiatives underway in this area. Finally, we examine some economics of HTE research as part of the drug development, marketing and treatment process. Understanding the economic incentives that exist is fundamental to aligning those incentives to improve the availability and use of HTE evidence. A clear understanding between regulators, pharmaceutical companies and payers about high value goals, methods to efficiently generate and communicate information and value propositions can lead to “win-win” scenarios for patients, individual payers, the healthcare system as a whole and the future of drug development in manufacturing new drugs.",0,0,
1223,menopause and sports,"OBJECTIVE: Accumulating data suggest that regular physical activity reduces mortality and increases functional lifespan in both men and women. This review attempts to describe the current state of the medical literature on this topic. METHODS: A narrative review of the current medical literature, including randomized clinical trials and clinical guidelines, addressing the health benefits of physical fitness and regular exercise in midlife and postmenopausal women. RESULTS: Reduction and prevention of obesity and its associated comorbidities (hypertension, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and heart disease) are one of the main benefits of physical activity. However, long-term physical activity is also associated with a reduction in cancer, dementia and cognitive decline, poor mood and anxiety symptoms, and a reduction in osteoporosis, osteopenia, falls and fractures. Beneficial physical activity includes exercises that promote cardiovascular fitness (aerobics), muscular strength (resistance), flexibility (stretching), and balance (many of the foregoing and additional activities such as yoga). CONCLUSIONS: Because it is clearly beneficial, inexpensive, and with minimal risk, maintaining a healthy exercise program should be a goal for each participant to improve lifelong well-being. Physicians should employ a variety of behavioral strategies to support their participants' physical fitness goals.",0,0,

METHODS: A pragmatic iterative design included a literature review and focus groups, followed by a formative evaluation including reflection, questionnaires, and interviews. GP practices and associated mental health teams in the south-east London community were involved. Participants included community psychiatrists, psychiatrists, nurses, GPs, managers and local experts with an interest in primary mental health care. RESULTS: The shared care model includes the core components of improved communication along with the development of a registry and database with systems for review and recall. Local needs assessments, audits, training and guidelines are complementary components. The intervention, Mental Health Link, is a facilitated quality improvement program designed to accelerate service development by bringing teams together to agree on a model of shared care that is responsive to local needs, abilities, and interests conforms, and by supporting the development of practice systems. CONCLUSIONS: A model for shared care must take into account the interdependencies of the components and the relationship to the context. The heterogeneity of primary and outpatient care needs to be reflected in the development of complex interventions aimed at improving shared care. It is possible to develop a generalizable complex intervention that responds to local circumstances.",0,0,

The effect of dietary advice on long-term weight change is unclear. Purpose: To conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of dietary counseling versus usual care on body mass index (BMI) over time in adults. Data sources: Early studies (1980 to 1997) from a previously published systematic review; MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1997 to July 2006. Study selection: English-language randomized controlled trials (≥ 16 weeks in duration) in overweight adults reporting the effect of dietary advice on weight. The authors only included trials of weight loss with a nutritional component. Data Extraction: Individual reviewers performed full data extraction;"" at least 1 additional reviewer reviewed the data. Data Synthesis: Random effects model meta-analysis of 46 dietary counseling studies yielded a maximum net treatment effect of 1.9 (95% CI, 2nd .3 to 1.5) BMI units (approximately 6%) at 12 months Meta-analysis of weight changes over time (slopes) and meta-regression indicate a change of approximately 0.1 BMI units per Month from 3 to 12 months of active programs and a recovery of approximately 0.02 to 0.03 BMI units per month during subsequent maintenance periods Various analyzes indicate that calorie recommendations, the frequency of support meetings, the inclusion of Exercise and diabetes may be independent predictors of weight change Limitations: The interventions, study samples, and weight changes were heterogeneous.The Stu The studies were generally of moderate to poor methodological quality. They had high rates of missing data and could not explain these losses. The meta-analytic techniques could not fully account for these limitations. Conclusions: Compared to usual care, dietary counseling interventions result in modest weight losses that decrease over time. Future studies should emphasize minimizing loss to follow-up and determining which factors lead to more effective weight loss.",0,0,

A joint commission of the German Medical Association and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians developed guidelines for substitution therapy for opiate addiction, which were adopted in March 2002 by the Board of Directors of the German Medical Association and published in Deutsches Ärzteblatt on May 24th. 2002. The present study is a systematic literature search on treatment success in general and on specific aspects of methadone substitution therapy, which are taken into account by the guidelines of the German Medical Association. The literature was updated through January 2004. Older randomized controlled trials and more recent quasi-experimental studies support that methadone maintenance therapy is an effective strategy to reduce illicit drug use, improve the health of drug users, reduce criminal behavior and promote rehabilitation of opiate addicts. The evaluation of international studies clearly shows that criteria for access to substitution therapy that go beyond the diagnosis of opiate dependence, eg the presence of a life-threatening comorbidity, are not a prerequisite for substitution therapy in other countries and are therefore not discussed internationally.

With the advent of new tools and technologies, clinicians and researchers are faced with an increasing variety of options, both for clinical assessment through digital capture of the essential behavioral elements of a condition, and for intervention through formalized treatments, coaching, and other technology-enabled means of patient communication . And yet, as with any new set of tools used to assess or treat a disease, establishing and following reporting guidelines - ie what works and under what conditions - is an essential part of the translational research process. Using the World Health Organization's recently published mHealth evaluation, reporting, and assessment guidelines for evaluating mobile health applications, we review the methodological strengths and weaknesses of existing studies on smartphones and wearables for schizophrenia. While growing evidence supports the feasibility of using mobile tools in severe mental illness, most studies to date have not adequately reported on accessibility, interoperability, cost, scalability, replicability, data security, usability testing, or compliance with national guidelines or legal regulations. Future research efforts addressing these specific gaps in the literature will help advance our understanding and realize the clinical potential of these new tools in psychiatry.",0,0,
1229,Methods for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia,"Studies ranging from the molecular to the clinical level suggest that cognitive dysfunction plays a central role in the characterization of schizophrenia. Accordingly, increased efforts have been expended to seek effective treatments for these broad and debilitating cognitive deficits. Three general strategies for treating cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia have emerged in the literature. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics have received much attention, but their procognitive effects are rather modest. Augmentation strategies driven by basic or translational research have often shown promise in small uncontrolled studies"";"" However, few compounds have performed well in rigorously designed studies. Behavioral interventions have shown beneficial effects that generalize to other symptom domains and persist post-intervention, but tend to be costly and labor-intensive. Although there have been some exciting advances in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, progress to date has been modest and the search for treatments continues.",0,0,
1230,Microcomputer generated memories. Improving primary care physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines,"Recent studies have documented that doctors' adherence to recommended regular check-ups improves with reminders about doctors. However, these reminders are often expensive to maintain and modify. This study examines the influence of a microcomputer tickler system on the arrangement of mammograms. All women (N = 1262) aged 40 years and older who attended an outpatient clinic during a 6-month period were randomly assigned to one of two groups. For the experimental group, the date of the last mammogram ordered and recorded in the clinical database was printed on the encounter form generated for each patient visit. No prior mammogram information was printed for patients in the control group. Women in the experimental group were more likely to have a mammogram ordered during the study period (19% vs. 12%, P=0.001), and consequently were more likely to comply with mammography guidelines at study completion (27 % versus 21%, P=0.011). Microcomputer-based data storage and retrieval systems can help draw physicians' attention to screening recommendations.",0,1,
1231,Microcomputer generated memories. Improving primary care physician compliance with mammography screening guidelines.,"study was conducted to examine the influence of microcomputer-generated ""reminders"" in prompting physicians to schedule regular mammography screenings for patients. The main reasons given by physicians for not performing screening tests such as mammography included forgetfulness, lack of time, inconvenience, and patient discomfort or refusal. The doctor's failure to recommend a mammogram is often due to an oversight on the part of the doctor at the time of a patient visit. This study demonstrates that a microcomputer-based reminder system can be used to increase adherence to physician recommendations for preventive healthcare. An experimental system resulted in a 50 percent increase in mammography orders among a group of women over 40 who participated in the study.",0,1,1230.0

1233,Minimizing omission errors: behavioral reinforcement of heparin to avoid venous embolism: the BEHAVE study,"AIM: Improve patient safety by increasing heparin thrombosis prophylaxis for patients in medical-surgical intensive care units using a multiple method approach for evidence-based guideline development and implementation. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study. SETTING: Medical-surgical intensive care unit. PARTICIPANTS: Multidisciplinary clinicians caring for critically ill patients in a 15-bed closed medical-surgical intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS: Phase 1 was a 3-month baseline period during which we documented anticoagulation and mechanical thromboprophylaxis. Phase 2 was a 1-year period during which we implemented a thromboprophylaxis guideline using a) interactive multidisciplinary educational events; b) verbal reminders to the ICU team; c) computerized daily recording of thromboprophylaxis by nursing staff; d) weekly graphic implemented feedback to individual critical care physicians on adherence to guidelines;"" and e) publicly displayed graphical feedback on group performance. Phase 3 was a 3-month follow-up phase 10 months later, during which we documented thromboprophylaxis. The computerized daily recording of thrombosis prophylaxis by the nursing staff continued during this period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were similar in all phases, although patients in phase 2 had higher acute physiology and chronic health assessment II scores than patients in phases 1 and 3. The proportion (median in % [ Interquartile range]) of patient days in the ICU with heparin thromboprophylaxis in phases 1, 2 and 3 was 60.0 (0, 100), 90.9 (50, 100) and 100.0 (60, 100) (p = 0.01). The proportion (median in % [interquartile range]) of days on which heparin thromboprophylaxis was incorrectly omitted in phases 1, 2 and 3 was 20 (0; 53.8), 0 (0; 6.3) and 0 (0,0) (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: After the development and implementation of an evidence-based thrombosis prophylaxis guideline, we found significantly more patients who received heparin thrombosis prophylaxis. Guideline compliance was maintained 1 year later. More research is needed on which strategies are most effective for implementing patient safety initiatives in the ICU.",0,1,
1234,Misprescribing Controlled Substances: An Evaluation of a Professional Development Program,"BACKGROUND: Controlled prescription drug (CPD) abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Most physicians enrolled in a three-day continuing professional development (PDP) continuing education (CME) program lack training in risk identification and how to manage patients who abuse CPDs. To address this issue, the authors conducted an evaluation of a PDP that trains physicians in proper prescribing, substance abuse detection, use of screening, brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT), and implementation of motivational interviews (MI). METHODS: The authors conducted a program evaluation to assess the effectiveness and impact of PDP on physician knowledge and prescribing behavior. RESULTS: Participants (N = 174) were typically middle-aged (mean age 53 years), male (89%), and physicians (82%) and other healthcare professionals (18%). Many physicians practice in solo primary care settings (46%). Course evaluations were conducted by n = 155 (89%) participants who rated the course and instructors highly (mean 4.8/5). The physicians' knowledge values at pre/post-assessments increased significantly: pretest (mean = 58.7, SD = 13.12) and posttest (mean = 78.28, SD = 9.83) (t(173) = 20.06, P</=0.0001, 95% confidence interval, CI: [-21.51, -17.65]). Almost half of the participants, n=83/174 (48%), completed the follow-up survey, and 93% agreed/strongly agreed (A/SA) that they had made changes in professional practice. Of participants practicing with an active Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration (n=57), most/strongly agreed that they had made changes to align their practices with current guidelines (89%), CPD used more appropriately (87%) and implemented an office prescribing policy (81%) identified and referred more substance abuse patients for treatment (80%) shared new information/experiences from the course with other 25 healthcare professionals (93%) and felt that the course had a positive impact on their personal and professional behavior (90% and 96%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study evaluating PDP in this population. Results showed participant satisfaction and an improvement in prescriber knowledge and self-reported prescribing behavior. However, more studies are needed to assess actual changes in clinical practice, direct impact on patient outcomes, and relapse rates.",0,0,
1235,Mitigating prenatal Zika virus infection in America,"Background: Because of the risk of Zika virus infection in America and the links between infection and microcephaly, other serious neurological disorders, and fetal death, health departments across the Region have advised women to delay pregnancy. However, the effectiveness of these policies in reducing prenatal Zika virus infection has yet to be quantified. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of pregnancy delay interventions on the incidence and prevalence of prenatal Zika virus infection. Design: Vector-borne Zika virus transmission model fitted to 2015-2016 epidemiological data on Zika virus infection in Colombia. Setting: Colombia, August 2015 to July 2017. Patients: Population of Colombia stratified by sex, age, and pregnancy status. Intervention: Recommendations for delaying pregnancy by 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24 months with different levels of adherence. Measurements: Weekly and cumulative incidences of prenatal infections and cases of microcephaly. Results: At 50% adherence to recommendations to delay pregnancy by 9 to 24 months, the cumulative incidence of prenatal Zika virus infection is likely to decrease by 17% to 44%, while recommendations to delay pregnancy by 6 months or less prenatal are likely to increase Infections by 2% to 7%. This paradoxical exacerbation of prenatal Zika virus exposure is due to an increased risk of pregnancies being delayed towards the peak of the outbreak. Limitation: Sexual transmission was not explicitly accounted for in the model due to limited data, but was implicitly subsumed in the overall transmission rate, which was calibrated to the observed incidence. Conclusion: Pregnancy delays can have a significant impact in reducing microcephaly cases, but carries the risk of exacerbating Zika virus outbreaks if the duration is insufficient. The length of the delay, population adherence, and timing of the start of the intervention must be carefully considered. Primary funding source: National Institutes of Health.",0,0,
1236,Mobile diabetes intervention study: testing a personalized treatment/behavioural communication intervention for glycemic control,"BACKGROUND: National data showing that baseline glycemic control is within target range (A1c or = 7.5%) (n = 260) and enrolled into study groups based on PCP randomization. All study patients will receive blood glucose (BG) meters and a year's supply of test materials. Patients in three treatment groups will choose one of two cell phone models, receive one year of unlimited cell phone data and a service plan, register on the web-based individual patient portal, and receive study treatment phone software based on study assignment. Patients in the control group receive the usual care from their general practitioner. The primary outcome is the mean change in A1c over a 12-month intervention period. CONCLUSION: Traditional methods of disease management have not achieved adequate control of blood glucose and other conditions important to people with diabetes.

1237,Mobile web app for self-management of low back pain: randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Nonspecific low back pain (NLBP) is the diagnosis for individuals with low back pain without an underlying medical cause (eg, tumor, infection, fracture, herniated disc, spinal canal stenosis). The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Pain Society (APS) recommend multidisciplinary treatments for NLBP that last longer than 4 weeks. However, this approach is impractical for many physicians, and relatively few providers offer NLBP treatment that meets the common ACP-APS guidelines. AIM: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile web intervention called ""FitBack"" to help users implement self-tailored strategies to manage and prevent NLBP occurrences. METHODS: A total of 597 adults were recruited, screened, consented, and assessed online at baseline, 2 months (T2), and 4 months (T3). After baseline assessment, participants were randomized into three groups: FitBack intervention, alternative care group, which received 8 emails asking participants to link to six internet resources for NLBP, and control group. The FitBack group also received weekly email reminders and assessment emails for 8 weeks. The control group was only contacted to make assessments. RESULTS: Users of the FitBack program demonstrated greater improvement compared to the control group for each comparison of the critical physical, behavioral, and workplace outcome measures at the 4-month follow-up. In addition, at the 4-month follow-up, users of the FitBack program performed better than the alternative treatment group on current back pain, behavior and workplace outcomes. For example, subjects in the control group were 1.7 times more likely to report current back pain than subjects in the FitBack group; Subjects in the alternative care group were 1.6 times more likely to report current back pain at the 4-month follow-up visit. In addition, users of the FitBack program demonstrated greater improvement in patient activation, planned behavior theory constructs, and attitudes toward pain compared to the control group and the alternative treatment group at the 4-month follow-up A theory-based standalone mobile web intervention , which tailors content to users' preferences and interests, can be a powerful tool for back pain self-treatment. Viewed from the RE-AIM perspective (ie, outreach, efficacy/effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance), this study supports the notion that this type of intervention has significant value as a potentially cost-effective tool that can reach a large number of users People. The results are promising considering that the FitBack intervention was not supported by professional caregivers, nor was it integrated into a health promotion campaign that might have offered additional support to the participants. However, more research is needed on how self-directed interventions are used on the mobile web over time and to understand factors associated with sustained user engagement.

1238,Modeling of Gaze Patterns in Doctor-Patient Interaction with Sequential Delay Analysis,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether lag sequence analysis could be used to describe gaze orientation between physicians and patients in the medical encounter. This topic is especially important as new technologies are implemented in multi-user healthcare settings, where trust is critical and non-verbal cues are an integral part of trust building. This analysis method could lead to design guidelines for technologies and more effective assessments of interventions. BACKGROUND: Nonverbal communication patterns are important aspects of doctor-patient interactions and can influence patient outcome. METHOD: The gaze behavior of physicians and patients in 110 videotaped medical encounters was analyzed using the lag-sequential method to identify significant behavioral sequences. The sequential delay analysis included both event-based delay and time-based delay. RESULTS: The results of the event-based lag analysis showed that the patient's gaze followed that of the doctor, while the doctor's gaze did not follow that of the patient. Time-based sequential analysis showed that patient responses typically occurred within 2 seconds of the physician's initial behavior. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the physician's gaze significantly affects the medical encounter, but that the converse is not true. APPLICATION: Findings from this research have an impact on the design of clinical work systems and the modeling of interactions. Similar research methods could be used to identify different behavioral patterns in clinical settings (physical arrangement, technology, etc.) to facilitate and evaluate the design of clinical work systems.",0,0,
1239,Moderators of remission with interpersonal counseling or drug treatment in primary care patients with depression: randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Although depressive disorders are very common, there is little research to assist primary care physicians in making treatment choices for patients with mild to moderate depression. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interpersonal counseling versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in primary care physicians with major depression and identify moderators of treatment outcome. METHOD: A nine-centre randomized controlled trial (DEPICS, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number: ACTRN12608000479303). The primary outcome was remission of the depressive episode (defined as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score </=7 at 2 months). Daily functioning was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify moderators of treatment outcome. RESULTS: The percentage of patients achieving remission at 2 months was significantly higher in the interpersonal counseling group than in the SSRI group (58.7% vs. 45.1%, P=0.021). Five moderators of treatment outcome were found: depression severity, functional impairment, anxiety comorbidity, previous depressive episodes, and smoking habits. CONCLUSIONS: We identified some patient characteristics that predict a different outcome with pharmacological and psychological interventions. Should our findings be confirmed in future studies, these characteristics will help clinicians define criteria for first-line treatment of depression that are targeted to patient characteristics.",0,0,
1240,Modifying dyspepsia management in primary care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial of education versus passive guideline dissemination,"BACKGROUND: Quality improvement initiatives in healthcare rely on the effective implementation of clinical practice guidelines. However, even well-constructed guidelines have little impact unless supported by dissemination and implementation strategies. AIM: To test the effectiveness of 'education' as a strategy to facilitate the uptake of dyspepsia management policies in primary care. STUDY DESIGN: A pragmatic, cluster-randomized, controlled guideline adoption study comparing outreach to guideline dissemination by mail. AREA OF APPLICATION: 114 general practices (233 general practitioners) in the Salford and Trafford Health Authority catchment area in North West England. METHOD: All practices received guidelines in the mail in July 1997. The intervention group practices began providing information three months later. This consisted of practice-oriented seminars with hospital experts, in which guideline recommendations were reviewed and implementation plans were formulated. The seminars were followed by “reinforcement visits” after a further 12 weeks. Outcome measures were: (a) the appropriateness of referral for"" and (b) findings on open-line upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; (c) cost of family doctor prescriptions for acid-suppressing drugs; and (d) use of laboratory-based serologic testing for Helicobacter pylori Die Data were collected for seven months before and/or after the intervention and analyzed by intention-to-treat. RESULTS: (a) The proportion of appropriate referrals was higher in the intervention group at the six-month-intervention period (practice medians: control = 50.0%, intervention = 63.9%, P<0.05); (b) the proportion of major findings at endoscopy did not change significantly; (c) there was a greater increase in total expenditure on acid-suppressing drugs in the intervention compared to the control group (+8% vs. +2%, P=0.005);"" and (d) the mean per-office testing rate for Helicobacter pylori in the post-intervention period was significantly greater in the intervention group (four versus 0, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that education may be more effective in changing clinical behavior than passive dissemination of guidelines. It also shows that unpredictable and unexpected results can occur.",0,0,
1241,Modifying angiotensin receptor blocker prescribing behavior by selectively removing management pre-approval requirements for losartan.,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether lifting the pre-approval (PA) for losartan in a healthcare organization (HMO) could reduce prescribing of the more expensive angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). METHODS HMO physicians were informed that losartan would no longer require PA and changes were made to the electronic prescribing computer program accordingly. The monthly distribution by drug of the number of prescriptions for ARBs issued to new patients before and after the policy change was calculated from data collected from electronic records. The proportion of losartan-treated patients (percentage and 95% confidence interval) who met criteria for treatment with ARBs (hypertension or heart failure in patients who developed angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor-reaction or macroproteinuria-related adverse reactions) in the first Month after treatment met PA requirement was reversed was calculated. RESULTS The total number of PA requests for ARBs decreased by 48.6% from 961 in December 2008, the month before the policy change, to 494 the following January and increased again to 651 in January 2010. Prescribing incidence changed from 121 to 255 treated patients per month (114% increase) for losartan, from 15 to 16 (6.7% increase) for candesartan and from 89 to 71 (20.2% decrease) for valsartan. The duration of action for reducing ARB requests for the more expensive drugs was approximately 1 year. Only 23.3% (95% CI 18.1-28.4) of patients receiving losartan met the criteria for receiving ARBs. CONCLUSIONS Eliminating the PA requirement for this drug alone was an effective, limited-duration strategy to reduce prescription of relatively expensive drugs",0,1,
1242,Modular ICT-based patient empowerment framework for diabetes self-management: design perspectives and validation results,"INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that more than 382 million people worldwide have diabetes, most of them between the ages of 40 and 59. ICT can play a key role in better diabetes management and patient empowerment. Patient empowerment involves patients to a greater extent in their own healthcare process, and disease management becomes an integrated part of their daily lives. Self-management gives patients the opportunity to contribute to their own health care and to have better control over their disease. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of an ICT-based patient empowerment framework on diabetes self-management. METHODS: A modular patient empowerment framework that promotes diabetes self-management was designed and implemented. The framework incorporates expert knowledge in the form of clinical guidelines and supports patients in defining personalized activities based on medical recommendations and personal goals, as well as collecting daily life observations. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed framework were evaluated in a pilot study involving 60 patients and 12 healthcare professionals. RESULTS: The study demonstrated that a patient empowerment approach based on ICT self-management tools is useful and accepted by both patients and physicians. For those patients who were already disciplined in their disease management, the pilot solution served as a data-logging facility. Moreover, it served as an incentive for better adherence to the principles of disease management. The ICT tools prompted many patients to become more physically active and to adjust their dietary habits. However, this influence proved to be closely correlated with the sociocultural background of the subjects. The study also showed that even with patient-centered self-management interventions, physicians still have a key role to play. However, the acceptability of such interventions by healthcare professionals depends not only on the impact on their patients' disease management, but also on the impact on their workflow. CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that a patient empowerment approach based on ICT self-management tools is useful and accepted by patients and physicians. In addition, there is clear evidence that ICT frameworks like the one presented in this paper support patients in behavior change and better disease management. Finally, it was recognized that self-management solutions should be built around the goal of not only educating and guiding patients in disease self-management, but also to support them in exploring the decision space and providing insight and explanations about the impact of their self-treatment on their own values in decision-making.",0,0,
1243,"Molecular sources of residual cardiovascular risk, clinical signals, and innovative solutions: Association with subclinical disease, undertreatment, and poor adherence: Implications of new evidence for optimizing cardiovascular patient outcomes","The residual risk, the continued significant risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid goals, remains a concern for cardiologists. Factors contributing to this ongoing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including other risk factors, the inherent properties of statin drugs, and patient characteristics ie genetics and behavior. In addition, providers, healthcare systems, the community, public policies and the environment play a role. Large statin studies indicate an average 28% reduction in LDL-C and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of about 69%. Incomplete risk mitigation and failure to improve at-risk conditions can result in sustained progression of atherosclerosis with new and recurrent lesions at original and distant sites, remodeling, arrhythmias, rehospitalizations, invasive procedures, and fatal disabilities. As a result, identifying additional agents to reduce residual risk, particularly when co-administered with statin drugs, has been an ongoing quest. The current model of atherosclerosis includes many steps during which the disease can progress independently of elevations in LDL-C as defined by the guidelines. Differences in genetic response to statin therapy, differences in the ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair, and differences in susceptibility to non-lipid risk factors such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes may all pose residual risk. A large number of inflammatory and metabolic processes can also offer possible therapeutic targets to reduce the residual risk. Classically, epidemiological and other evidence suggested that increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. When LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to target levels, low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely related to MCVE. Efflux capacity, or the ability to translocate cholesterol from macrophages, is thought to be an important anti-atherogenic mechanism responsible for the reduction in MCVE, mediated in part by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, anticoagulant and vasodilating properties, including protecting LDL from oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has a major impact on endothelial function. In addition, HDL promotes endothelial repair and progenitor cell health, and supports the production of nitric oxide. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and autoimmune diseases may not be protective or even become pro-inflammatory or pro-oxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL-cholesterol was not beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, coupled with extensive pre-clinical information on the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the ""HDL hypothesis"" that raising HDL-cholesterol per se will reduce MCVE. Following the ambiguous AIM-HIGH study (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) and the withdrawal of two key cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target side effects and the other for lack of efficacy Development continues on two additional compounds, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which significantly lower LDL cholesterol. The negative but controversial HPS2-THRIVE study (The Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by experimental evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic effects of HDL. Mirroring the cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B, non-HDL cholesterol has surpassed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. In addition to including a measure of residual risk, the benefits of using non-HDL cholesterol as the primary lipid target are now compelling. The reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, high blood pressure and diabetes will help reduce residual risk. Although greatly improved, control of risk factors other than LDL-cholesterol currently remains inadequate due to deficiencies in guideline compliance and poor patient adherence. More efficient and widespread use of proven simple therapies such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers in combination with statin therapy may improve outcomes better than the use of other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multimechanistic, global and national programs employing primary, primary and secondary prevention to reduce the overall level of cardiovascular risk are needed.",0,0,
1244,Monitoring and management of metabolic effects of antipsychotic drugs: a cluster-randomized study of an intervention combining evidence-based quality improvement and external moderation,"Background The treatment of psychotic disorders consists mainly of second-generation antipsychotics, which are associated with metabolic side effects such as overweight/obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines recommend timely assessment and treatment of these conditions,” however, research studies show deficits and delays in metabolic monitoring and treatment in these patients. This protocol article describes the project ""Monitoring and Management for Metabolic Side Effects of Antipsychotics,"" which is testing an approach to implementing recommendations for these practices.Methods/Design This project uses a cluster-randomized clinical trial design to to test the effectiveness of an evidence-based quality improvement plus supportive intervention. Eligible study sites were VA medical centers with ¡Ã 300 patients starting a new antipsychotic prescription within six months. A total of 12 sites, matched in pairs based on the results of an organizational practice survey, were then randomized within pairs to receive intervention or control conditions. Study participants include VA staff involved in metabolic monitoring and treating patients ed with antipsychotics at participating sites. The intervention includes researchers collaborating with clinical stakeholders to facilitate customization of local implementation strategies to remove barriers to monitoring and management of metabolic side effects. The intervention includes a design phase (initial site visit and subsequent development of a local implementation plan); Implementation phase (guided by an experienced external facilitator);"" and a sustainability phase.

BACKGROUND: Advanced knowledge of the concept of adherence is required for the development of nursing interventions and nursing guidelines for patients with coronary artery disease. DESIGN: A multicenter, cross-sectional study. Methods: This study was conducted from February to December 2013 in 416 patients with coronary artery disease 4 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. A self-report questionnaire was used to assess their adherence to therapy. The data were analyzed using structural equation models. RESULTS: The theory explained 45% of healthy lifestyle adherence and 7% of medication adherence. Structural equation modeling confirmed that nursing motivation and outcomes had the highest association with adherence to a healthy lifestyle. Responsibility was associated with adherence to medication. Support from family members, support from nurses and doctors, and motivation, cooperation, fear of complications, and a sense of normalcy were associated with adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients who are motivated to care for themselves and who value the outcomes of care are more likely to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. Responsible patients were more likely to stick to their medication. It is important to consider these elements as part of secondary prevention strategies in patients with coronary artery disease after percutaneous coronary intervention.",0,0,

Results: In an analysis that included all randomized patients, the 12-month change in hemoglobin A1c levels compared to usual care was 0.46% (95% CI, 0.81% to 0.11%) in in the Motivational Enhancement Therapy Plus group with cognitive behavioral therapy and 0.19% (CI, 0.53% to 0.16%) in the Motivational Enhancement Therapy alone group. There was no evidence of treatment effects on secondary outcomes. Limitations: Of 1659 patients screened, only 507 were eligible and 344 participated. No primary endpoint data were available for 11.3% of participants. The study design did not allow distinguishing the additive effect of cognitive behavioral therapy plus motivational enhancement therapy from the effect of greater intensity and duration of the combined intervention compared to motivational enhancement therapy alone. Conclusion: Nursing motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy is feasible for adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. Combination therapy results in a modest 12-month improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels compared to usual care, but motivational enhancement therapy alone does not.",0,0,
1249,"Motivational interviewing: Helping people through change., 3rd edition","This best-selling work for professionals and students is the authoritative presentation of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the powerful approach to facilitating change. More than just an update, the third edition has been completely restructured around the new four-process model of MI (Engagement, Focus, Evocation and Planning). MI originators William R. Miller and Stephen Rollnick demonstrate how the processes work in practice, describe a rich spectrum of applications, and address the growing evidence base. Imbued with respect and compassion for clients, the book begins with a thorough overview of the spirit and method of MI. Sections on each of the four processes provide step-by-step guidance on building a strong working relationship, developing clear focus and direction, evoking and strengthening the client's motivation for change, and formulating a concrete plan of action. The main communication skills used in MI are explained"";"" Vignettes and interview examples clearly illustrate the ""dos and don'ts"" of successful implementation in different contexts. Ways to build proficiency in MI, integrate it with other practices, and assess intervention fidelity are discussed. Key points at the end of each chapter increase the book's usefulness for teaching and professional development. The accompanying website (www.guilford.com/p/miller2) provides other helpful resources, including reflection questions, annotated case material, an expanded bibliography, and a glossary. Reflecting major advances in the understanding and teaching of MI, this book is essential reading for mental health and healthcare practitioners, including addiction specialists, clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, family therapists, counselors, nurses, physicians, and health educators.

1250,Motivational Interviewing: Is That All Our Clients Need?,"Motivational Interviewing (MI) and its offshoots, such as the Drinker's Check-up and Motivational Enhancement Therapy, have grown in popularity in the academic and addiction treatment communities over the past decade. This article first looks at the reasons for this popularity, suggesting that it is due to suspected cost-effectiveness, relevance to interventions in non-treatment-seeking populations, and the essential nature of addiction as a motivational disorder. The article then proceeds to review evidence for the effectiveness of MI in both non-treatment-seeking and treatment-seeking samples, taking into account published systematic reviews and, in particular, the results of the MATCH project. The relevance of possible results from the UK Alcohol Treatment Trial will also be considered. The article also looks at mechanisms of change that might be responsible for the functioning of MI. It ends with a list of conclusions about the effectiveness of MI, the possible roles in treatment it can fulfill, the client groups for which it may be particularly useful, and what further research is needed.

1251,Mouthwash for oral mucositis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis is a common side effect of allogeneic stem cell transplantation and can lead to increased morbidity, mortality and costs. It also affects the patient's quality of life. In the stem cell transplantation station of a Swiss university hospital, the patients are instructed according to the current guidelines for mouthwashes and the oral status is evaluated daily. RESEARCH QUESTION: How do patients experience oral mucositis and what factors influence their behavior to rinse their mouth regularly? METHOD: In this qualitative part of a concurrent embedded mixed-methods research, 14 patients were interviewed using an interview guide. The data was analyzed using content analysis methods. RESULTS: The results showed that oral mucositis cannot be considered separately from illness, isolation and care. Mucositis was only a serious burden for patients if it was severe. In patients with low-grade onset, other symptoms were more important. The research identified motivating and debilitating factors for regular mouthwashing, which is one of the most important preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of understanding oral mucositis in the context of transplantation and that knowledge of motivating and disabling factors can assist nurses in patient care. An essential aspect is the improvement of patient self-management.",0,0,
1252,"Much Cheaper, Almost as Good: Decrementally Cost-Effective Medical Innovation","In resource-constrained conditions, cost-saving innovations, even if slightly less effective than available options, can improve overall outcomes by enabling more efficient reallocation of resources. The authors systematically reviewed all MEDLINE-cited cost-benefit analyzes written in English between 2002 and 2007 to identify and describe cost- and quality-reducing medical innovations that might offer favorable ""decremental"" cost-effective trade-offs - defined as Savings of at least $100,000 per quality-adjusted year of life lost. Of 2128 cost-effectiveness ratios from 887 publications, only 9 comparisons (0.4% of the total) described 8 innovations that were considered decrementally cost-effective. Examples included percutaneous coronary interventions (instead of coronary artery bypass grafts) for multivessel coronary artery disease, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (instead of electroconvulsive therapy) for drug-resistant major depression, vigilant waiting for inguinal hernias, and sterilization and reuse of hemodialyzers. On a patient basis, these innovations resulted in savings of $122 to nearly $12,000 but losses of 0.001 to 0.021 quality-adjusted life years (roughly 8 hours to 1 week). These results demonstrate the rarity of decrementally cost-effective innovations in the medical literature.",0,0,
1253,Multidimensional analyzes to assess the connections between treatment decisions by physicians and patient characteristics using COPD as an example,"BACKGROUND: In some settings, practice guidelines do not provide clear, evidence-based guidance for COPD treatment choices, particularly when large studies have failed to identify subgroups of high or low responders to available medications. METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study examined the yield of four types of multidimensional analyzes to assess associations between clinical characteristics of COPD patients and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments prescribed by pulmonary specialists in a real-world context. RESULTS: A total of 2494 patients from 515 respiratory physicians were recruited. Multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering identified 6 clinical subtypes and 6 treatment subgroups. Strong bidirectional associations between clinical subtypes and treatment subgroups were found in multivariate logistic regression. Although the overall frequency of prescriptions varied from one clinical subtype to another for all types of pharmacologic treatments, clinical subtypes were not associated with specific prescription profiles. When canonical redundancy analysis was used, the proportion of variation in pharmacological treatments explained by clinical features remained modest: 6.23%. This proportion was larger (14.29%) for non-pharmacological treatment components. CONCLUSION: This study shows that although pharmacologic treatments for COPD are quantitatively very well associated with patient clinical characteristics, there is no specific patient profile that could be qualitatively associated with prescriptions. This underscores the uncertainties felt by physicians in differentiating the relative effects of available pharmacological treatments. The methodology used here is useful for identifying areas of uncertainty that require further research and/or guidance clarification.",0,0,
1254,Multidisciplinary treatment of pediatric obesity: nutritional assessment and management,"Assessment and treatment methods for pediatric obesity are evolving rapidly. Obesity is thought to be caused by an imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure and requires a comprehensive assessment of patient, family, environmental, genetic, and cultural characteristics so clinicians can design successful interventions. Quantitative nutritional assessment of caloric intake is difficult and time consuming and should only be used in isolated settings, e.g. B. in research, or if initial approaches to treatment were not successful. Alternatively, providers should identify dietary patterns or behaviors that have been associated with obesity and represent promising targets for change. Clinicians should tailor interventions by considering patient and family motivations and willingness to change. Current guidelines recommend a gradual escalation of treatment plans, and multidisciplinary treatment teams are recommended for patients requiring intensive intervention. Vendors involved at a multidisciplinary level need to integrate their area of expertise with that of the team to develop a comprehensive management plan. This article provides an overview of current recommendations for the assessment and management of pediatric obesity with a focus on nutritional assessment as part of a multidisciplinary team.",0,0,
1255,Multifactorial influences and deviations from the safety and quality of drug administration in the acute medical and surgical context,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although numerous factors influence drug administration, our understanding of the interplay of these factors is limited to medication quality and safety. The aim of this study was to investigate the multifactorial influences on medication quality and safety within the framework of a uniform test guideline for medication administration in acute care. APPROACH: An exploratory/descriptive study with nonparticipant observation and follow-up interview was used to identify factors affecting medication quality and safety in medication administration episodes (n=30). Observations focused on nurses' interactions with patients during drug administration and the characteristics of the environment in which this took place. Confirmation of the observed data occurred after the conclusion of the observation period during short semi-structured interviews with participating nurses. RESULTS: Results indicated that nurses developed therapeutic relationships with patients in terms of assessing patients prior to administering medication and educating patients about medication during medication administration. Caregivers were more likely to be distracted when medications were stored and prepared in a shared medication room per ward design. Nurses deviated from best practice guidelines when administering medication. IMPLICATIONS: Nurses' skills and willingness to develop therapeutic relationships with patients increased the quality and safety of medication, thereby protecting patients from potential adverse events. Deviations from best practice drug administration had the potential to reduce medication safety. System factors such as station design, which determines medication storage areas, can easily be taken into account to minimize potential errors. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses demonstrated behaviors that improved the quality and safety of medication administration"";"" however, violations of practice standards have been observed. These results will inform future intervention studies to improve drug quality and safety.",0,0,
1256,Multifactorial intervention with nurses does not change cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease,"Strict implementation of multi-target guidelines reduces vascular risk in diabetics. Whether this also applies to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. To assess this, the MASTERPLAN study randomized 788 patients with CKD (estimated GFR 20-70 mL/min) to receive additional intensive care (the intervention group) or a nephrologist (the control group). The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. During a mean follow-up of 4.62 years, modest but significant decreases in blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, anemia, proteinuria along with increased use of active vitamin D or analogs, aspirin, and statins were noted in the intervention group compared to controls. No differences were found in rates of smoking cessation, weight loss, sodium excretion, physical activity, or glycemic control. Intensive control did not reduce the rate of the composite endpoint (21.3/1000 person-years in the intervention group compared to 23.8/1000 person-years in the control group (hazard ratio 0.90)). No differences were found in the secondary endpoints of vascular surgery, all-cause mortality, or end-stage renal disease. Thus, the additional intensive caregiver support in patients with CKD improved some risk factor levels but did not significantly reduce the rate of primary or secondary endpoints.",0,0,
1257,Multi-level support for physical activity and healthy eating,"AIM: This paper reports on a study evaluating the relationship between social and community support and physical activity and dietary behaviors in a low-income Latino population with multiple chronic conditions. BACKGROUND: With consistently lower levels of physical activity than whites and documented nutritional deficiencies, Latinos represent a disproportionate proportion of the population with chronic diseases in the United States. This pattern of health inequalities is evident in all countries working to improve the health of low-income, immigrant and indigenous communities. Social-ecological theories of health behaviors emphasize the importance of considering social and community support for health behaviors and provide a useful framework for considering ways to improve physical activity and nutrition for immigrant and aboriginal groups. METHOD: We report here data from a baseline assessment of 200 patients from a health clinic in the United States serving a low-income, primarily Hispanic population. Participants were enrolled in Resources for Health, a randomized controlled trial to promote multilevel support for chronic disease self-management. Measures included self-reported physical activity, dietary behaviors, and multi-level support for chronic disease management, as well as demographic data. The basic data reported here were collected between February 2002 and September 2003. RESULTS: Utilizing multi-level support (e.g., family, individual, and healthcare provider) was statistically significantly associated with meeting physical activity guidelines and better dietary behaviors. Being a woman and having multiple chronic medical conditions has also been linked to better eating habits. These variables explained 20% of the variance in dietary behavior. CONCLUSION: The results support a social-ecological approach to promoting healthy behaviors in this low-income, mainly Hispanic sample with multiple chronic conditions. In interventions to improve physical activity and nutrition, it is important to address multiple levels of support for healthy behaviors, and caregivers may be particularly well placed to address such issues for low-income, Aboriginal and immigrant patients with chronic conditions.",0,0,
1258,Multiple prescription patterns for antipsychotics,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current prescribing practices related to concomitant antipsychotic drug use and summarize the reasons why clinicians may prescribe >1 planned agent. METHODS: The pharmacy identified patients at William R. Sharpe Jr Hospital who were currently receiving antipsychotic therapy. All patients receiving >/=2 concomitant scheduled antipsychotics were included in the study. Data on demographic characteristics, drug combinations currently used, history of attempted regimens, and prescribing physician rationale were prospectively evaluated for a 60-day period from December 13, 2000 to February 10, 2001. Other tried drug regimens were compared with medical records and published treatment guidelines for schizophrenia compared. RESULTS: Over a 60-day follow-up period, 206 patients were placed on scheduled antipsychotics, with 85 (41%) receiving at least 2 agents. Respondents to a prescriber questionnaire (59%) indicated that augmentation was the most common justification for combination therapy”; the least likely rationale was cross-titration. The survey responses also demonstrated the belief that there was questionable therapeutic benefit in more than half of the patients treated with multiple antipsychotic combinations. In addition, medical records showed that the majority of these patients had not received an adequate trial of monotherapy with other atypical or typical agents or clozapine prior to combination antipsychotic therapy. Fifty-one percent of medical records did not document a justification for adjunctive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of published data, the use of multiple antipsychotics is considered a gray area that requires increased awareness by the prescriber when assessing efficacy and safety. Documenting the rationale, side effects, and response to the treatment regimen is essential to optimal patient care.",0,0,
1259,Electronic alerts on multiple screens to improve venous thromboembolism prophylaxis,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in high-risk patients is often underutilized. We previously developed a one-screen computer alert program that identified hospitalized patients at high risk of VTE who were not receiving prophylaxis and advised their physicians to prescribe prophylaxis. While this strategy reduced the 90-day incidence of symptomatic VTE by 41%, the majority of electronic alerts were ignored. We have now developed a serial three screen alert computer program to educate physicians who initially refused to order prophylaxis after a single screen alert. Of a total cohort of 880, physicians in charge received a single electronic alert for 425 patients, while 455 who declined prophylaxis after the first screen received the second and third screens of the novel three-screen alert. Our enhanced serial three-screen alert program generated VTE prophylaxis orders for 58.4% of the 455 patients whose physicians initially declined to order prophylaxis after the one-screen alert. There was no significant difference in the 90-day symptomatic VTE rates between the two cohorts (2.8% for the one-screen vs. 2.2% for the three-screen, p=0.55). We conclude that our three-screen computer alert program can significantly improve prophylaxis for physicians who reject an initial single-screen alert.",0,1,
1260,Does diabetes have to be a deadly disease in Africa? Investigating the cost of treatment,"GOAL Estimate the cost of diagnosing and treating diabetes in Tanzania. DESIGN Costs were estimated using the reported and recorded experiences of patients with new-onset diabetes in 1989-90 and of diabetics first seen in 1981-2. SETTING Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam. PARTICIPANTS 464 patients (315 males and 149 females). 262 patients with diagnosis from September 1, 1989 to August 31, 1990 (Group 1) and 202 patients from June 1, 1981 to August 31, 1982 (Group 2). RESULTS The average annual direct cost of diabetes care in 1989-90 was $287 for an insulin-dependent patient and $103 for a non-insulin-dependent patient. Insulin purchases accounted for 68.2% ($156) of the average annual outpatient cost for insulin-dependent patients. For patients who do not require insulin, the cost of oral antidiabetic drugs and management of chronic complications and infections accounted for 42.5% ($29.3) and 48.8% ($33.7) of costs, respectively. The cost of diabetic outpatient care across Tanzania was estimated at $2.7 million, *75,128 (32.2%) of which for insulin. Doctor and nursing costs accounted for 0.2% of the total costs of outpatient care. Annual direct inpatient care costs have been estimated at $1.25 million. Approximately 0.2% of Tanzania's population aged 15 and over used the equivalent of 8% of total government health spending, equivalent to $47,4088,382. CONCLUSION Diabetes places a heavy strain on the limited resources of developing countries. If African patients with diabetes have to pay for their treatment, most will not be able to and will die.",0,0,
1261,Nationwide survey of alcohol screening and brief intervention practices at US Level I trauma centers,"BACKGROUND: In 2007, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma introduced a requirement that Level I trauma centers have a mechanism for identifying patients who are problem drinkers and the ability to provide an intervention for patients provide that have tested positive. Although the landmark alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) mandate is expected to have an impact on trauma practice nationwide, a literature review found no studies that have systematically documented SBI practice prior to the ACS requirement. STUDY DESIGN: Trauma programs at all U.S. Tier I trauma centers were contacted and asked to complete a survey on SBI practice prior to ACS requirements at trauma centers. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight of 204 (73%) Level I trauma centers participated in the survey. More than 70% of responding centers routinely used laboratory tests (eg, blood alcohol concentration) to screen patients for alcohol, and 39% routinely used a screening question or standardized screening tool. About 25% of screen-positive patients received formal alcohol counseling or had an informal alcohol talk with staff. CONCLUSIONS: The study observed significant differences between Level I centers in the percentage of patients screened and in the type and extent of intervention delivery in screen-positive patients. Following the requirements of the ACS Committee on Trauma, future research could systematically implement and evaluate training to deliver evidence-based alcohol interventions and training to develop the organizational capacity of trauma centers for sustainable delivery of SBI.",0,0,
1262,Naturopathic treatment of earache in children,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis media is one of the most common diseases of infancy and childhood and one of the most common reasons for children to consult a doctor. In the last 2 decades, the diagnosis of otitis media has increased significantly worldwide. In the United States, 93% of all children by age 7 have had at least 1 episode of acute otitis media (AOM). Otalgia is the hallmark of AOM. Most affected children either complain of earache or exhibit behavior that the parents interpret as evidence of earache. Treating ear pain early in the course of AOM reduces both parental anxiety and child discomfort, and accelerates the healing process. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of a naturopathic treatment compared to conventional treatment for otalgia commonly associated with AOM in children. Methods: The study was designed as a double-blind study in an outpatient community clinic. A total of 171 children aged 5 to 18 years with ear pain and clinical findings related to otitis media were examined. Children were randomly assigned to treatment with naturopathic herbal extract ear drops (NHED) or anesthetic ear drops with or without amoxicillin. At enrollment, children were assigned by computer-numbered randomization to receive NHED (contents: Allium sativum, Verbascum thapsus, Calendula flores, Hypericum perfoliatum, lavender, and vitamin E in olive oil) 5 drops 3 times daily alone (Group A) or concomitantly a local anesthetic (amethocaine and phenazone in glycerol) 5 drops 3 times a day (group B) or oral amoxicillin 80 mg/kg/day (maximum 500 mg/dose) divided into 3 doses with either NHED 5 drops 3 times a day ( Group C) or local anesthetic 5 drops 3 times a day (Group D). A double-blind design was used and all ear drops were placed in identical bottles. Treatment was initiated by the nurse in all cases. A single physician (MS) evaluated and treated all patients included in the study and collected all data. The presence or absence of ear pain was assessed over 3 days using a visual analogue scale. Ear pain was assessed from previous reports using a specially designed observational instrument. One side of the instrument consisted of a linearly numbered scale from 1 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) and a corresponding color scale ranging from blue to dark red. The back contained a scale of 5 facial expressions ranging from a big smile (no pain) to a sad and crying face (worst pain) and a corresponding color scale ranging from blue to dark red. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of patient age or sex, fever grade, main symptoms, associated symptoms, and severity or laterality of the acute otitis media. Each group had a statistically significant improvement in ear pain over the 3 days. Patients given ear drops alone responded better than patients given ear drops along with amoxicillin. The results were better in the NHED group than in the control group. However, the findings showed that the pain was mostly (80%) self-limiting and could be explained simply by the elapsed time. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend topical medications as the first line of treatment for ear pain in the absence of a systemic infection or serious underlying condition. Since no evidence was found that systemic antibiotics alone improve treatment outcome, if antibiotics do not alter the natural history of otitis media, the main goal of treatment should be relief of ear pain, as in the present study. The alternative, naturopathic herbal extract medications may offer many new opportunities in the treatment of earache associated with AOM. GPs should be aware that at least 10% of their patients may have tried one or more forms of alternative/complementary medicine before presenting for a consultation. As has been extensively reported in the medical literature, these herbal extracts have the potential to fulfill all the requirements for suitable drugs that could be routinely used in pediatric patients, namely bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity in vitro against common pathogens, immune stimulating ability, antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effects. They are also well absorbed and penetrate well into the tissues surrounding the eardrum. They have been found to enhance local immunological activity. Finally, herbal extracts are well tolerated (due to their long elimination time), easy to administer, and less expensive than the new antibiotics. There are no documented side effects. Based on our findings that the group with the most significant treatment effects (NHED with topical anesthesia) explained only 7.3% of the total pain reduction, we suggest that sometimes the family doctor or pediatrician needs to give the human body a chance to repair itself. However, if the physician believes there is an indication for treatment, particularly if the parents are concerned, then local treatment such as that used in our study may be appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that in cases of pediatric earache caused by AOM that require active treatment in addition to a simple 2 to 3-day waiting period, a herbal extract solution may be beneficial. Simultaneous antibiotic treatment is obviously not beneficial.",0,0,

1265,Decision-making at the end of life in newborns: Physicians' attitudes and relationship to self-reported practices in 10 European countries,"Context The ethical issues surrounding end-of-life decision-making for infants with poor prognosis are controversial. There is little empirical evidence on the attitudes and values underlying such decisions in different countries and cultures. Aim To investigate the variability in attitudes of neonatal physicians in 10 European countries and the relationship between such attitudes and self-reported practice of end-of-life decisions. Design and Setting Survey conducted in 1996-1997 in 10 European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania). Participants A total of 1391 physicians (response rate 89%) regularly employed in 142 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Main outcome measures scores on an attitudinal scale that measures opinions about the absolute value of life (score 0) versus the value of quality of life (score 10)"";"" Self-report of ever setting limits to intensive neonatal interventions with poor neurological prognosis. Results Physicians from Hungary (mean setting values, 5.2 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.9-5.5]), Estonia (4.9 [95% CI, 4.3-5.5]), Lithuania (5.5 [95% CI, 4.8-6.1]) and Italy (5.7 [95% CI, 5.3-6.0]), while physicians tend to agree that quality of life is considered came from the United Kingdom (attitude values, 7.4 [95% CI, 7.1-7.7]), the Netherlands (7.3 [95% CI, 7.1-7.5]), and Sweden (6.8 [95% CI, 6.4-7.3]) . Other factors associated with positive attitudes about quality of life were being female, having no children, being Protestant or having no religious background, not considering religion important, and being in a NICU with a high number to work from very low-birth weight newborns. Physicians with scores that more closely reflected quality of life were more likely to report that their practice had limited intensive interventions in the face of poor neurologic prognosis, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1 ,7) per unit adjustment score change. Conclusions In our study, the likelihood that physicians set limits for intensive neonatal interventions when the neurological prognosis is poor depends on their attitude. After adjusting for potential confounders, country remained the most important predictor of physician attitudes and practices.",0,0,
1266,Neurobehavioural morbidity associated with sleep disordered breathing in children: a comprehensive review,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively review the research on the association between childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and neurobehavioral functioning. DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative literature research. ADJUSTMENT: N/A. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: N/A. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The results of 61 studies on the relationship between child SDB and neurobehavioural functioning were critically assessed and synthesized. There is strong evidence that SDB in childhood is associated with deficits in behavioral and emotional regulation, academic achievement, sustained attention, selective attention, and wakefulness. There is also evidence that SDB is minimally associated with a child's typical mood, expressive language skills, visual perception, and working memory. The results were insufficient to draw any conclusions about intelligence, memory, and some aspects of executive functioning. Mechanisms by which SDB might lead to neurobehavioral morbidity are under investigation, but clinical symptoms such as chronic snoring remain the best predictors of morbidity. Short-term studies of SDB treatment outcomes are encouraging, but long-term outcomes are unknown. If SDB is not treated, children appear to be at risk for long-term neurobehavioural deficits. CONCLUSIONS: SDB in childhood is associated with neurobehavioral morbidity. Using commonly used guidelines for causal inference, there is strong evidence for associations, consistent results, and specificity of effect, even in the absence of a much-needed randomized clinical trial. There is evidence that this association fits the expected temporal pattern and that SDB is a biologically plausible cause of neurobehavioural deficits. Clinicians should be alert to the coexistence of SDB symptoms and concerns about a child's academic progress, attention, arousal, or behavior or emotion regulation.",0,0,

DESIGN Population-based case-control study. SETTING Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital Research Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Newborn screening cards from 443 white patients with cerebral palsy and 883 white controls were tested for enterovirus and herpesvirus viral nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction. Group A herpesviruses included herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and group B herpesviruses included varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7). RESULTS The prevalence of viral nucleic acids in the control population was high: 39.8% of controls tested positive and the prevalence was highest in preterm infants. Detection of herpes group B viral nucleic acids increased the risk of developing cerebral palsy (odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.59).

1268,Never too old? Age should not be a barrier to participation in cancer clinical trials,"Across Europe and the US, over 60% of all cancer incidence occurs in the elderly (> or = 65 years), a patient population that, due to a number of factors, requires special consideration in treatment decisions. Despite this, elderly patients are generally underrepresented in clinical trials, so study data should be interpreted with caution, as results in younger cancer patients cannot always extrapolate to the typical elderly cancer patient. Reports suggest that elderly cancer patients account for approximately 22% of patients enrolled in phase II clinical trials. Barriers to enrolling older patients in clinical trials include the lack of appropriate trials, a high comorbidity burden, study-related limitations, and physician recruitment. There is an assumption that elderly patients may not tolerate various cancer therapies, which may lead to the exclusion of this patient population from prospective studies. However, clinical data show that age alone is not a sufficient reason to discontinue treatment. A lack of data from clinical trials and the associated lack of evidence-based guidelines for older patients means that physicians have little guidance, resulting in patients potentially not receiving the optimal therapy. Because clinical trials are the primary method for evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant and palliative cancer therapies, trials specifically targeting older cancer patients are needed to adequately assess the risks and benefits of treatment in this vulnerable population. The aim of this review is to assess the clinical reality and the discrepancy between age and age of clinical trials in order to assess the implications for older cancer patients and how to address this situation. Possible reasons for the disparity and the resulting clinical consequences are also considered.",0,0,

1271,New drugs in anesthesia: can we afford them?,"The key challenge facing physicians today is the dilemma of providing quality care in a fiscally responsible manner. The costs are no longer negligible. Pharmacoeconomics is a fundamental part of medical education. Economic issues should be an integral part of drug development and clinical trials. While anesthesiologists are concerned that using cheaper drugs could affect outcome and patient satisfaction, there is little evidence to support such concerns. This is a fertile area for intensive future research. Pharmacoeconomics is a dynamic. Drug costs are not static, drug use patterns are changing rapidly, and clinical practice is in a state of constant flux. The answer to cost containment is not simply to trim, clip, eliminate or simply hope for the best for the best, but to manage and modify the practice while accommodating changing needs. Educational programs, policies, departmental policies, system changes, and financial incentives can be implemented to ensure consistent and ongoing adherence to the principles of pharmacoeconomics and value-based care. Some suggest that National Societies should establish guidelines for cost-effective practice. Others advocate the physician's autonomy in drug selection. It is difficult to change the doctor's behavior. This change will be gradual and will be the subject of many emotionally charged philosophical debates. There will be great reluctance to refuse patients pharmacologically superior drugs based on cost alone, especially since drugs represent such a small part of the total cost. We must exercise caution to ensure that we do not become too clever and foolish. Drug procurement costs are just one element in a large and complex equation. Focusing on the cost of buying drugs can be dangerous, even naïve when we fall for knowing the cost of everything but the value of nothing.",0,0,

1275,NHMRC Guidelines for Clinical Practice in ASD and PTSD,"Dear Editor, I recently described the case of a diving instructor who was suffering from Acute Stress Disorder (ASD), a type of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following the death of one of her students. The treatment described was a combination of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises. Coincidentally, in August, the Australian Center for Post-Traumatic Mental Health published Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines for ASD and PTSD. These have been endorsed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The treatment described in the diver injury case is consistent with these guidelines. NHMRC guidelines suggest that immediately following a traumatic episode (e.g., death or serious injury to a diver), the most helpful response is to provide psychological first aid. This includes providing information about traumatic stress responses, encouraging self-care, and using available social support. It is recommended that the physician monitor the patient, be alert for improvement, plateau, or worsening, and be prepared to offer help or appropriate referral if necessary. The guidelines recommend the use of trauma-focused psychological therapy as a first-line intervention for ASD and PTSD. EMDR, including in vivo exposure, and CBT are considered the most effective treatments. When medication is required, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the best choice. For the benefit and convenience of patients and physicians, the NHMRC guidelines and a comprehensive set of educational guides on ASD and PTSD are available online as PDF file downloads at http://www.acpmh.unimelb.edu.au. An update in the Medical Journal of Australia provides traumatic stress information for medical professionals, including screening questions that can be used to identify patients suffering from ASD and PTSD.

1279,No impact from active dissemination of the Ottawa Ankle Rules: further evidence of the need for local implementation of practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Local implementation strategies are often required to promote consistent adherence to clinical guidelines, but they are time-consuming and expensive. The authors tested an educational intervention aimed at increasing the use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules, a widely used set of clinical guidelines previously shown to reduce the use of radiographs to diagnose acute ankle injuries. Methods: The study consisted of a quasi-experimental, comparative before-and-after analysis. Trained experts provided hour-long training sessions and educational materials on the Ottawa Ankle Rules to healthcare professionals from 63 Ontario hospitals. Participants were asked to rate the intervention. The authors then compared, for periods before and after the training sessions, the use of ankle radiography in adults with acute ankle injury in 10 hospitals who received the training intervention and reported no (n = 5) or some (n = 5) prior use of the rules and in 5 Control hospitals that rejected the educational intervention because they were already implementing the rules. RESULTS: Although participants rated the Ottawa Ankle Rules and the training very positively, there was no reduction in the use of ankle radiography in the 10 hospitals that received the training (73% before and 78% after the intervention, p=0 ,11). In contrast, the use of X-ray decreased significantly from 75% to 65% in the 5 control hospitals (p=0.022). INTERPRETATION: Even if a dissemination strategy is well accepted and includes a widely accepted clinical guideline, the impact on behavior in clinical practice may be small. In addition to wide dissemination, an active local implementation strategy is needed to encourage physician adoption of clinical guidelines.",0,0,
1280,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis in adolescents taking psychiatric drugs: literature review, case reports, and management","OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a worldwide epidemic due to the greater prevalence of obesity. Despite the impact on adolescents with severe mental disorders, little has been published in the psychiatric literature about this increasingly common medical comorbidity. The objectives of this article are: 1) to provide an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of NAFLD, including progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)""; 2) to describe two clinical cases illustrating difficulties in management;"" and 3) reviewing screening recommendations, differential diagnoses, and surveillance and intervention approaches. METHODS: A literature review was performed, including guidelines and recommendations, with case presentations including case and control liver histology biopsy photos. RESULTS: Childhood NAFLD, a precursor to NASH, progresses to fibrosis in a small percentage of adolescents, putting them at risk for early-onset cirrhosis and the need for transplantation. The cases presented raise concern that adolescents with severe mental health disorders, who are already at higher risk of obesity and its consequences, may be at greater risk of progression to NASH, possibly due to greater weight gain on top of being overweight or obese Changes in liver metabolism caused by psychotropic drugs that promote fat storage. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rapid weight gain in the overweight or obese categories, or patients who develop elevated hepatic transaminases that persist beyond 3-6 months, should be evaluated by their psychotropic physician for early detection, diagnosis, and co-evaluation, or be referred for screening. Treatment by a pediatric gastroenterologist to reduce the risk of progression to NASH, which is reversible when early and sufficient lifestyle modification results in significant weight loss. There is an urgent need for controlled research into the associations between weight gain, psychiatric drugs, ultrasound and biopsy findings, and rates of progression to NAFLD and NASH in adolescents taking weight-gaining psychiatric drugs.",0,0,
1281,Noninvasive imaging predicts spinal failure loading with simulated osteolytic defects,"BACKGROUND: The clinical management of lytic tumors of the spine is currently based on geometric measurements of the defect. However, the mechanical behavior of a structure depends on both its material and its geometric properties. Quantitative computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry have been studied as non-invasive tools to measure the material and geometric properties of vertebrae with a simulated lytic defect. Yield loads were predicted from these measurements using composite beam theory. METHODS: Thirty-four fresh-frozen cadaveric spines were segmented into functional spinal units of three vertebral bodies with two discs at the thoracic and lumbar spine. Lytic defects of the same size were created in one of three locations: anterior, lateral, or posterior of the vertebra. Each spinal unit was scanned using computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and axial and flexural stiffnesses were calculated from the image data. Each specimen was failed under combined compression and forward bending, and the axial load and bending moment in yield were recorded. RESULTS: Although the relative defect size was nearly constant, the measured yield loads showed a large scatter, suggesting that the defect size alone is a poor predictor of failure. However, the image-derived measures of structural stiffness correlated moderately well with the measured yield loads. Furthermore, using composite beam theory with quantitative computed tomography-derived stiffnesses, vortex yield loads were predicted on a one-to-one basis (concordance, r(c) = 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: Although current clinical guidelines for predicting fracture risk are based on geometric measurements of the defect, we have shown that the relative size of the defect alone is not responsible for the variation in vertebral yield stress. However, analysis of composite beam theory with quantitative measures of stiffness derived from computed tomography can be used to prospectively predict the yield loads of vertebrae with lytic defects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Image-predicted vertebral loads and analysis models that approximate spinal loads during activities of daily living can be used to calculate a fracture risk factor that can be used by physicians to plan an appropriate treatment or intervention.",0,0,

PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of acupuncture, back schools, psychological therapies, exercise therapy, functional restoration, interdisciplinary therapy, massage, physical therapies (interference therapy, low-level therapy). laser therapy, lumbar supports, shortwave diathermy, superficial heat, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasound), spinal manipulation, and yoga for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain).DATA SOURCES: English-language studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (up to November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented with manual searches of reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews and randomized trials of one or more of the preceding therapies for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain) that reported pain outcomes, back function, general health status, disability, or patient satisfaction. DATA EXTRACTION: We have information on study design, population characteristics , interventions, outcomes and adverse events are abstracted. To assess methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for single studies Chronic or subacute (>4 weeks) low back pain. Benefits over placebo, sham, or no treatment averaged 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analog pain scale, 2 to 4 points on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, or a standardized mean difference of 0.5 to 0.8. We found strong evidence that acupuncture, massage, yoga (viniyoga), and functional restoration are also effective for chronic low back pain. For acute low back pain (duration < 4 weeks), the only non-pharmacological therapies with proven efficacy are superficial heat (good evidence of moderate benefit) and spinal manipulation (good evidence of minor to moderate benefit). Although serious damage appeared to be rare, little data on damage was reported. No studies have addressed the optimal sequence of therapies, and methods for tailoring therapy to individual patients are still in the early stages of development. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of sciatica therapies. LIMITATIONS: Our primary data source was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language studies only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Therapies with good evidence of moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute low back pain include cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation. For acute low back pain, the only therapy with good evidence of efficacy is superficial heat.",0,0,
1284,Non-pharmacological management of hypertension: results from interviews with 100 general practitioners,"AIM: To describe the type and extent of non-pharmacological treatment that general practitioners offer for essential hypertension. DESIGN: An open-label, interviewer-administered survey using a standard case of a 60-year-old male with essential hypertension. 70 interviews were conducted in person and 30 by telephone. SETTING: General practices in Auckland. SUBJECTS: A random sample of 100 general practitioners in Auckland. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Aspects of patient history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and treatment relevant to nonpharmacological management. RESULTS: There was a response rate of 84%. Most general practitioners reported offering non-pharmacological treatment at the first consultation prior to prescribing medication. Few, however, offered detailed programs. Dietary therapy, alcohol restriction, and exercise were suggested by most general practitioners. Less popular non-pharmacological interventions were sodium restriction and behavioral therapy. The median number of patient visits to a primary care physician before prescription medication was five, in line with guidelines. The median number of days from the first visit to the prescription of drug therapy was 42 (range 2-341). Clinical advice provided by the majority of participants was consistent with current guidelines for treating hypertension, but the range of advice given was wide. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that primary care physicians are aware of non-pharmacological interventions to treat hypertension. They report the routine use of non-pharmacological therapies for blood pressure reduction and other health benefits early in the clinical process before pharmacological therapy is considered. These non-pharmacological therapies do not come with well-defined and detailed programs.",0,0,

The group has so far conducted 12 clinical trials involving more than 2500 patients, ranging from small phase II to large randomized phase III trials. At the time of writing, two randomized trials (comparing two doses of IV pamidronate and melphalan-prednisone (MP) vs. MP-thalidomide in elderly patients) are ongoing. The group aimed for a simple organization with much responsibility delegated to regional coordinators (Denmark 3, Norway 5, Sweden 5).

Like other clinical trial groups, NMSG faces a number of challenges in the coming years. The financial situation for independent investigator-initiated studies is far from satisfactory, especially with regard to the resource-intensive implementation of stricter rules of good clinical practice and the demands of ethics committees.

AIM: To investigate the use of a behavioral “nudge” based on the principle of public obligation to promote prudent use of antibiotics in acute respiratory infections (ARIs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized clinical trial in 5 primary care outpatient clinics. A total of 954 adults had ARI visits during the study period: 449 patients were treated by physicians randomized to the posted letter of commitment (335 in baseline period, 114 in intervention period)"";"" 505 patients were treated by physicians randomized to standard practice control (384 at baseline, 121 intervention). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of posting poster-sized letters of commitment in examination rooms for 12 weeks. These letters, which include doctors' photos and signatures, reaffirm their commitment to avoiding the inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics for ARIs. MAIN RESULTS AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescription rates for antimicrobial ineligible ARI diagnoses at baseline and intervention periods, adjusted for patient age, gender, and insurance status. RESULTS: The baseline rates were 43.5% and 42.8% for the control and the poster, respectively. During the intervention period, inappropriate prescription rates increased to 52.7% for controls but decreased to 33.7% in the published commitment condition. Controlling for baseline prescribing rates, we found that the posted letter of commitment resulted in an absolute 19.7 percent reduction in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing rates compared to the control group (P=0.02). There was no evidence of a shift in diagnostic coding, and rates of prescription of appropriate antibiotics did not decrease over time. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Posting poster-sized commitment statements in exam rooms reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs. The effect of this simple, inexpensive intervention is comparable to more costly, intensive quality improvement efforts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01767064.",1,1,
1290,Nudging physician prescribing decisions by order set partitioning: results of a vignette-based study,"Background Healthcare professionals are rapidly adopting Electronic Medical Records (EHRs). Within EHRs, seemingly innocuous menu design configurations can sway vendor decisions for better or worse. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate whether the grouping of menu items systematically influences the prescribing practices of general practitioners. Participants We surveyed 166 primary care physicians in a research network of practices in the greater Chicago area, of whom 84 responded (51% response rate). Respondents and non-respondents were similar on all observable dimensions, except that respondents tended to work in an academic setting. Design The questionnaire consisted of seven clinical vignettes. Each vignette described typical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infections, and providers selected treatments from a menu of options. For each vignette, providers were randomly assigned to one of two menu areas. For antibiotic-inappropriate vignettes, the treatment menu either listed over-the-counter (OTC) drugs individually while prescriptions were grouped together, or displayed the reverse split. For antibiotic-eligible vignettes, the treatment menu either listed narrow-spectrum antibiotics individually while broad-spectrum antibiotics were grouped, or displayed the reverse split. Key Metrics The key outcome was provider choice of treatment. For antibiotic-inappropriate vignettes, we categorized reactions as prescription drug or OTC-only options. For antibiotic-appropriate vignettes, we categorized the responses as broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Key Findings Across all vignettes, there was an 11.5 percentage point reduction in the selection of aggressive treatment options (eg, broad spectrum antibiotics) when aggressive options were grouped compared to listing the same options individually (95% CI: 2.9 up to 20.1%); "" p?=?.008). Conclusions Provider treatment choice appears to be influenced by the grouping of menu options, suggesting that the layout of EHR prescription sets is not an arbitrary exercise. The careful creation of EHR prescription sets can be an important opportunity to improve patient care without compromising physicians' ability to prescribe what they believe is best for their patients.",1,1,
1291,Push to caution? The effect of reminders on antibiotic prescriptions.,"Antimicrobial resistance is a major and growing global health threat with significant consequences. The judicious use of antibiotics is crucial to delay the spread of resistance. In this study, I use a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of reminders from primary care patients on antibiotic use. The intervention was carried out in 31 clinics during the flu season in Stockholm. Two-tiered randomization was used, with randomization at the clinic level as well as at the individual patient level. With reminders, antibiotic use fell by 12.6 percent compared to the control clinics. The effect occurs at a clinical level, suggesting that physician or physician–patient interactions, not individual patients, are affected. Results from a follow-up experiment also suggest that an impact on doctor-patient interactions is the main reason for the main findings. Behavioral interventions that target these interactions have the potential to reduce antibiotic use. More research is needed, however, as monitoring and compliance may also play a role.",0,1,
1292,"Nurse-led, home-based self-care treatment for primary care patients with chronic fatigue syndrome: randomized controlled trial","AIM To evaluate the effectiveness of home-delivered pragmatic rehabilitation—a program of gradually increasing activity developed jointly by the patient and therapist—and supportive listening—an approach based on nondirective counseling—for patients in primary care with chronic fatigue syndrome /Myalgia encephalomyelitis or encephalitis (CFS/ME). DESIGN Single-blind, randomized, controlled study. MISSION 186 general practices in North West England between February 2005 and May 2007. PARTICIPANTS 296 patients aged 18+ with CFS/ME (mean disease duration seven years) diagnosed according to the Oxford criteria. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned, as usual, to pragmatic rehabilitation, supportive listening, or general practitioner care. Both therapies were delivered at home in 10 sessions over 18 weeks by one of three specialist adult general nurses who had received four months of training, including supervised practice, in each of the interventions. General practitioner treatment as usual was unrestricted, except that patients were not to be referred for systematic psychological therapies during the treatment period. Main outcome measures The primary clinical endpoints were fatigue and physical functioning at the end of treatment (20 weeks) and 70 weeks after enrollment compared to usual family care. Lower fatigue scores and higher physical functioning scores indicate better outcomes. RESULTS A total of 257 (87%) of the 296 patients enrolled in the study were evaluated at 70 weeks, the primary endpoint. Analysis was based on treatment intent, with robust treatment effects estimated using probability weights after adjusting for missing data. Immediately after treatment (after 20 weeks), patients assigned to pragmatic rehabilitation (n=95) showed significantly improved fatigue (estimate of effect -1.18, 95% confidence interval -2.18 to -0.18""; p= 0.021) but no physical functioning (-0.18, 95% CI -5.88 to +5.52; p=0.950) compared to patients assigned to treatment as usual (n=100) at one year after the end of treatment (70 weeks), there were no statistically significant differences in terms of fatigue or physical discomfort functioning between patients assigned to pragmatic rehabilitation and those treated as usual (-1.00, 95% CI -2.10 to +0.11, p=0.076 and +2.57, 95% CI 3.90 to +9.03, p=0.435) Patients assigned to supportive listening (n=101) , had poorer physical functioning than those allocated to treatment as usual (-7.54, 95% CI -12.76 to -2.33; P=0.005) and no difference in fatigue. At 70 weeks, patients assigned to supportive listening did not differ significantly from those assigned to treatment as usual on either of the primary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS In patients with CFS/ME in primary care, pragmatic rehabilitation performed by trained nursing therapists improves fatigue in the short term compared to unrestricted family care as usual, but the effect is small and not statistically significant at one year of follow-up. Supportive listening by trained nursing therapists is not an effective treatment for CFS/ME. Trial Registration International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number IRCTN74156610.",0,0,

Here we evaluate whether rigorous implementation of multi-objective guidelines with the help of nurses practitioners (NP) improves management in patients with CKD. METHODS: MASTER PLAN is a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in nine Dutch hospitals. Patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20–70 mL/min) were randomized to receive NP support (intervention group (IG)) or medical care (control group (CG)). Patients were followed for a median of five years. The data presented are an interim analysis of risk factor control after two years of follow-up. RESULTS: We enrolled 788 patients (532 M, 256 F), (393 KG, 395 IG), mean (+/-SD ) age 59 (+/-13) years, eGFR 38 (+/-15) ml/min a/1.73 m(2), blood pressure (BP) 138 (+/-21)/80 (+/-11) mmHg. After two years, 698 patients (352 IG, 346 KG) could be analyzed. IG had lower systolic (133 vs. 135 mmHg&semi; p=0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (77 vs. 80 mmHg&semi; p=0.007), LDL-cholesterol (2.30 vs. 2.45 mmol) compared to CG (-l);"" p= 0.03) , and increased use of ACE inhibitors, statins, aspirin, and vitamin D. The intervention had no effect on smoking cessation, body weight, physical activity, or sodium excretion. CONCLUSION: In risk factor management improved in both groups. However, changes in blood pressure control, lipid management, and medication use were more pronounced in IG than in CG. Lifestyle interventions were not effective. Coaching by NPs thus benefits the day-to-day care of CKD patients. Whether these changes translate into an improvement in clinical endpoints remains to be seen.",0,0,
1294,"Nurse-led motivational interviews for lifestyle changes in patients with type 2 diabetes (MILD project): protocol for a cluster-randomized, controlled trial of implementing lifestyle recommendations","BACKGROUND: The diabetes of many patients is treated in general medicine"";"" Healthcare providers aim to promote healthy behaviors such as healthy eating, adequate physical activity and smoking cessation. These measures can reduce insulin resistance, improve glycemic control, lipid abnormalities and high blood pressure. They can also prevent cardiovascular disease and complications of diabetes. However, professionals do not optimally adhere to guidelines for lifestyle advice. Lifestyle change motivational sessions for patients with type 2 diabetes are designed to improve diabetes care according to national lifestyle counseling guidelines. Primary care nurses are trained in motivational interviewing embedded in structured care in general practice. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and methods of a study evaluating the impact of nurse education on patient outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: A grouped, randomized, controlled study of 70 primary care practices (35 practices in the intervention arm and 35 in the control arm) that began in March 2007. A total of 700 patients with type 2 diabetes will be recruited. Patients in the intervention arm are cared for by the primary care nurse, who is trained in an implementation strategy using motivational interviewing as a core component. Other components of this strategy will include localization of the diabetes protocol, introduction of a social card to support lifestyle, and educational and supportive tools to maintain motivational interviewing. The control arm is encouraged to maintain usual care. The nursing process, metabolic parameters (glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure and lipids), lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity, smoking and alcohol), health-related quality of life and the patient's willingness to change behavior are used as measures of effectiveness. The measurements take place at the start of the study and after 14 months. DISCUSSION: The use of motivational interviewing in patients with diabetes in primary care has been studied, but to our knowledge no other study has evaluated the implementation and sustainability of patient motivation and involvement in daily diabetes care in general practice. If this intervention proves effective and cost-effective, large-scale implementation of this care-oriented intervention will be considered and expected.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether algorithm-driven nurse telephone care improves lipid control in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes at a government-funded community health center were randomly assigned to intervention groups (n = 381) or usual care groups (n = 381). INTERVENTIONS: Nurses independently initiated and titrated lipid therapy and promoted behavior change through motivational interviewing and self-management techniques. Other parameters of diabetes care were addressed due to time constraints. MAIN MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dL. Secondary endpoints included the number of hospital admissions, total hospital costs per patient, and the proportion of patients meeting other lipid, glucose, and blood pressure guidelines. MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of patients with an LDL < 100 mg/dL increased from 52.0% to 58.5% in the intervention group and decreased from 55.6% to 46.7% in the control group (p<0.01 ). The average cost per patient to the healthcare system was lower for the intervention group ($6,600 vs. $9,033, P=0.03). Intervention patients tended to have fewer hospital admissions (p=0.06).

1296,Nurses' assessments of CPOT use 12 months after implementation in the ICU,"BACKGROUND: Conducting routine pain assessments in all patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is strongly recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Because many ICU patients are unable to self-report, the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) is one of the two behavioral pain scales recommended for clinical use. Nonetheless, no study has described the assessments of its use in daily practice in the ICU. OBJECTIVE: To describe nurses' assessments of feasibility, clinical relevance, and satisfaction with CPOT use 12 months after its implementation in the ICU. Method: A descriptive design was used. It was performed in the medical-surgical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated facility in Greenfield Park (Quebec, Canada). A four-section self-administered assessment questionnaire (ie, feasibility, clinical relevance, satisfaction, and sociodemographic information) was completed by critical care nurses, all trained in the use of the CPOT. The questionnaires were filled out anonymously. RESULTS: A total of 38 critical care nurses returned their completed questionnaire (63% response rate). In terms of its feasibility, the majority rated the CPOT as quick to use, easy to understand and easy to fill out (92-100%). In terms of clinical relevance, nearly 70% of ICU nurses reported that CPOT had impacted their practice, but lower scores (<50%) were found for effective communication of pain assessment results with physicians and other healthcare professionals . More than 80% of ICU nurses were satisfied with daily use. CONCLUSION: The use of CPOT was considered feasible and relevant in daily practice according to the nurses' assessments, but did not allow for effective communication with other members of the nursing team in the ICU. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Training should be offered to all members of the ICU care team, and other implementation strategies should also be explored to ensure optimal adoption of a pain assessment approach that impacts their pain management decision-making process.",0,0,

1298,Nurses' representations of caring for mentally challenged patients and perceived needs to ensure quality care,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: To examine nurses' representations of caring for people with intellectual disabilities, intervention strategies they currently use, and identify the needs to ensure quality care. BACKGROUND: Nurses work in many settings and with different clientele. Certain clientele have needs that require specific approaches, such as people with an intellectual disability. The care of these patients can be influenced by the substitutions of the nurses who care for them. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with thematic analysis were conducted with 18 nurses working in hospitals and communities. RESULTS: Nurses are concerned about their ability to recognize the specific nature and complex needs associated with intellectual disability in patients, to promote quality care by addressing the behavioral and communication challenges, and with the perceived lack of time and organization within the work environment. Current strategies include attempts to promote continuity of care. Participants also identified their learning needs, which are relational and informational in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses generally seem to be aware that they want to provide quality care to patients with intellectual disabilities, while acknowledging that there are many contextual and practical elements that need to be improved to ensure the safety of these patients . RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be trained to adapt to evidence emerging from current research showing that people with intellectual disabilities want to be part of their local communities and to encourage those individuals to do so. This can be facilitated by adopting specific policies, protocols, and care programs. Further research is needed to better understand the expectations of these patients and their caregivers, with a focus on self-advocacy and health promotion techniques, with the goal of improving personalized standards of practice and reducing inequalities in health education for these patients.",0,0,
1299,Strategies used by nurses to address self-care issues related to medication adherence and symptom recognition in patients with heart failure: an in-depth look,"OBJECTIVE: Despite an increasing body of knowledge about self-care in heart failure patients, the need for effective interventions remains. Our goal was to increase understanding of the interventions heart failure nurses use in clinical practice to improve patient adherence and symptom monitoring. METHODS: A qualitative study with a targeted content analysis was conducted using data from a selected sample of Dutch-speaking heart failure nurses who had completed two-vignette brochures addressing medication adherence and symptom recognition. RESULTS: Nurses regularly reassess and reassess patients before deciding on an intervention. They evaluate basic/factual information and barriers in a patient's behavior and try to find room for improvement in a patient's behavior. Interventions that heart failure nurses use to improve adherence to therapy and monitor symptoms were categorized as enhancing knowledge, increasing motivation, and providing practical tools for patients. Nurses also described the use of technology-based tools, increased social support, alternative communication, partnership approaches, and care coordination to improve medication adherence and symptom monitoring. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong focus on educational strategies, nurses also reported other strategies to increase patient adherence. Nurses employ various strategies to improve patient adherence that are not included in guidelines. These interventions need to be evaluated for further applications to improve heart failure management.",0,0,
1300,Nursing Research in the United States: The Protection of Human Subjects,"In the United States, protection of the rights of human subjects in experiments has evolved at three levels: professional, public, and private. At the professional level, codes, guidelines, and patients' rights address issues of protecting the dignity, privacy, and autonomy of individuals serving as research subjects. At the public level, regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services have become the standard for protecting human subjects. At the private level, United States common law regulates the behavior of individual researchers by requiring them to act in accordance with generally accepted standards of care. As professionals, nurses must be actively involved in shaping public policy regarding the conduct of research and strive to formulate a research agenda that ensures that the ethics of research in nursing are unquestioned.",0,0,

1302,"Nursing student beliefs about smoking, their own smoking behavior, and the use of professional tobacco treatment interventions","As the largest group of healthcare professionals, nurses are in a unique position to influence their smoking patients. They also have more patient contact than any other provider. The purpose of this survey study was to describe nursing student beliefs about cigarette smoking, their smoking behavior and use of evidence-based tobacco treatment interventions. Of 200 nursing students surveyed, only 6% were smokers. The most inaccurate perception about tobacco treatment was that less than 3 minutes of counseling had no effect on improving smoking cessation rate. Eight percent of smokers surveyed said they had offered tobacco treatment to all smoking patients, compared to 26 percent of non-smokers. Smoking-related morbidity and mortality justify the consistent application of clinical practice guidelines by nursing students and professional nurses.",0,0,

The Maternal and Child Health Department, the Administration for Health Resources and Services, and the Department of Health and Human Services","OBJECTIVES: To develop recommendations for physicians, nurses and nutritionists to guide the assessment and treatment of overweight children and adolescents. METHODS: The Maternal and Child Health Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, Department of Health and Human Services convened a panel of pediatric obesity experts to develop the recommendations. RESULTS: The committee recommended that children with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 85th percentile with complications of obesity, or with a BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile, with or without complications, be evaluated and possible undergo treatment. Physicians should be aware of the signs of the rare exogenous causes of obesity, including genetic syndromes, endocrine disorders, and mental disorders. They should screen for complications of obesity, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, orthopedic disorders, sleep disorders, gallbladder disease, and insulin resistance. Medical conditions that warrant consultation with a pediatric obesity specialist include pseudotumor cerebri, obesity-related sleep disorders, orthopedic problems, massive obesity, and obesity in children under 2 years of age. Recommendations for treatment assessment included an assessment of the patient's and family's willingness to engage in a weight management program and a targeted assessment of diet and exercise habits. The primary goal of obesity therapy should be a healthy diet and activity. The use of weight maintenance versus weight loss to achieve weight goals depends on the patient's age, baseline BMI percentile, and the presence of medical complications. The committee recommended treatment that starts early, involves the family, and introduces gradual lasting changes. Parenting skills are the basis for a successful intervention that allows for gradual, targeted increases in activity and targeted reductions in high-fat, high-calorie foods. Ongoing family support after the initial weight management program will help families maintain their new behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations provide practical guidelines for pediatricians evaluating and treating overweight children.",0,0,
1306,Observational study of telephone consultations by stroke professionals to support the delivery of plasminogen activators into community tissues,"OBJECTIVES: Barriers to the intravenous (iv) use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in ischemic stroke are the limited treatment experience of general practitioners. Acute stroke care models have been developed to address these limitations by providing community support. This includes support by phone or televideo, with or without subsequent transport to tertiary care centers. The authors describe the incidence, characteristics, and impact of community telephone consultations at a 24/7 stroke ""hotline"" staffed by stroke physicians at an academic stroke center using such a model. METHODS: Twelve interventional hospitals participating in the Increasing Stroke Treatment through Interventional Behavior Change Tactics (INSTINCT) study were provided with a single-access number (""hotline"") for expert advice on tPA use. The experts consisted of stroke-trained physicians from an academic medical center. The use of a hotline was not required by the study protocol, nor was patient transfer required. The consultants had to record all treatment questions in a web-based log. All patients referred via the hotline and/or treated with tPA at an INSTINCT hospital underwent a multi-level medical record review by trained care coordinators. Cases were linked to logged hotline calls based on time of treatment and first treating hospital. Physician assessors assessed the adequacy of tPA treatment, the presence of deviation from standard guidelines, and treatment complications (intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], systemic hemorrhage, or death). RESULTS: Over a 27-month period, there were a total of 204 hotline calls to 116 patients. Ninety-one percent of the calls were between 8 a.m. and midnight, and 77% of the questions addressed questions of eligibility for IV tPA, particularly for mild stroke or improving stroke (26%). A total of 243 patients were treated with iv tPA in the 12 intervention hospitals, 54 of whom used a hotline consultation. 76% of hotline patients for whom tPA was recommended actually received tPA, while 2% of those for whom tPA was not recommended received the drug. There were no differences in protocol deviations (27.8% hotline group vs. 23.8% non-hotline group), incidence of symptomatic ICH (5.6% vs. 7.3%), or in-hospital mortality (5.6% vs .13.2%). No medico-legal issues were reported in any case in the study. CONCLUSIONS: Providing tPA decision support via telephone consultation to office-based physicians is feasible and safe. Counselors may play a more important role in determining tPA non-eligibility than acceptability. Future work should include a real-time survey of physicians to identify such potential qualitative benefits of a stroke hotline.",0,0,
1307,Oncology Perspectives on Treatment of Rare Cancers: A Nationwide Survey,"PURPOSE: In response to the challenges and difficulties of rare cancers, multi-stakeholder initiatives to improve the treatment of rare cancers were launched and several recommendations from professional societies were made. However, these primarily reflect the views of proponents and supporters and may not represent the views of the ""average"" clinician or researcher. In this study, we attempted to examine perceived difficulties related to treating rare cancers and possible solutions supported by oncologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A representative sample of 420 oncologists recruited from 13 cancer centers participated in a nationwide survey. RESULTS: Oncologists faced various difficulties when treating patients with rare cancers, including lack of clinical practice guidelines (65.7%) and personal experience (65.2%), lack of approved treatment options (39 .8%) and reimbursement issues (44.5%). . They generally supported recent recommendations from multi-stakeholder initiatives and professional societies to develop clear clinical practice guidelines (66.0%), flexible reimbursement policies (52.9%) and a national registry for rare cancers (47.4%) ). However, there was only moderate support for referrals to high-volume centers (35.5%) and promotion of off-label treatments (21.0%). CONCLUSION: Insights into the general attitudes of oncologists gained through our nationwide survey of representative samples would be helpful in developing clinical practices and public health policies in the treatment and research of rare cancers.",0,0,
1308,Implementation of the 5A model of brief smoking cessation intervention by oncology healthcare providers: patient perceptions,"AIM: Health care providers (HCPs) can play an important role in promoting smoking cessation and preventing relapse. Public Health Service guidelines recommend the ""5A"" model of brief intervention. The aim of the current study was to examine perceptions of cancer patients regarding the implementation of the 5A model by their oncological HCPs. METHODS: This study enrolled 81 breast and 87 head and neck cancer patients at a large NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center. Patients completed questionnaires assessing their oncology HCPs' perception of their implementation of the 5A model of brief intervention. RESULTS: The results indicate partial implementation of the 5A model. The majority of patients reported that their caregivers asked about smoking and advised them to quit"";"" only half reported that their interest in quitting had been assessed, and few reported support for quitting or follow-up. Provision of the 5A was greater in patients who sought cessation advice from their HCPs. CONCLUSION: The current results suggest that adherence to 5A in oncology needs to be improved. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Efforts to improve the delivery of smoking cessation treatments by HCPs may improve smoking cessation rates in cancer patients and ultimately translate into better long-term cancer treatment outcomes.",0,0,
1309,"One size fits all? Mixed methods evaluation of the impact of 100% single room accommodation on staff and patient experience, safety and costs","Background and objectives There is little clear evidence on the impact of single room placement on the quality and safety of healthcare. We examine the impact of all single rooms on staff and patient experience, safety outcomes and costs. Methods Mixed methods before/after “relocation” comparison within four nested case study wards in a single acute care hospital with 100% single rooms; Quasi-experimental before-and-after study with two control hospitals;"" Analysis of capital and operational costs associated with single rooms. Results Two-thirds of patients expressed a preference for single rooms, in which comfort and control outweighed the disadvantages felt by some (feeling of isolation) Outweighed. Patients valued privacy, confidentiality, and flexibility for visitors who provide single rooms. Staff perceived improvements (patient comfort and confidentiality), but single rooms were inferior in terms of visibility, monitoring, teamwork, monitoring, and patient protection. The walkways of the Staff increased significantly after moving. A temporary increase in falls and medication errors on a ward was likely related to the need to adjust work patterns rather than to single rooms per se. We found no evidence that single rooms reduced infection rates. Building a one-room hospital can cost 5% more with higher housekeeping and cleaning costs, but the difference over time is marginal. Conclusions Employees had to make significant adjustments to their work practices and did not feel prepared for new ways of working that could have a significant impact on the way teams work in the longer term. Staff preference remained at a mix of single rooms and bays. Patients preferred single rooms.",0,0,
1310,One-year outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatments for discogenic low back pain: a community-based prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: The clinical entity discogenic low back pain remains controversial at a fundamental level, including its pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and optimal treatment. This is despite the availability of four randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatments. One study showed benefit for lumbar fusion compared to unstructured nonsurgical care, and three others showed roughly similar outcomes for lumbar surgery and structured rehabilitation. PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of community-based surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with chronic low back pain due to degeneration at one or two levels of the lumbar spine. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients presenting with axial back pain to orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in academic and private practices in a large metropolitan area. OUTCOME MEASURES: Roland-Morris score for back disability (primary outcome), current assessment of total pain severity on a numeric scale, back and leg pain burden measures, the Short Form Questionnaire 36 version 2 physical function scale, use of medication for pain, work status, emergency room visits, hospitalization and other operations. METHODS: Patients who underwent spinal surgery within 6 months of admission were designated as the ""surgical treatment"" group and the remainder as the ""nonsurgical treatment"" group. Results were assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after enrollment. RESULTS: We recruited 495 patients with discogenic low back pain who presented for the initial surgical consultation in the offices of 16 surgeons. 86 patients (17%) underwent surgery within 6 months of study entry. Surgery consisted of instrumented fusion (79%), disc replacement (12%), laminectomy or discectomy (9%). Surgical patients reported greater pain and physical disability at baseline and were more likely to have had prior surgery. Adjusting for baseline differences between groups, surgery showed a limited benefit over nonsurgical treatment of 5.4 points on the modified (23 points) Roland disability questionnaire (primary outcome) 1 year after study enrollment . Using a composite definition of success that includes 30% improvement in Roland score, 30% improvement in pain, no use of opioid painkillers, and work (if relevant), the 1-year success rate was 33% for surgical procedures and 15% for for non-surgical treatment. The reoperation rate was 11% in the surgical group"";"" The post-treatment surgery rate in the non-surgical group was 6% at 12 months post-enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical group showed greater improvement compared to the non-surgical group at 1 year, although the combined success rate for both treatment groups was only fair. Results should be interpreted with caution as results are short-term and treatment was not randomly assigned. Only 5% of nonsurgical patients received cognitive behavioral therapy. The non-surgical treatment patients received varied and, for the most part, did not conform to key guidelines.",0,0,
1311,The continuous provision of individual clinical performance data improves practice behaviour,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines summarize findings from the scientific community and attempt to translate these findings into clinical practice. The ubiquitous and consistent adoption of these guidelines into the day-to-day practice of vendors has proven slow. METHODS: Using postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis guideline compliance as our metric, we compared the effects of continuing medical education (CME) alone (I), CME with a single snapshot of provider compliance (II) and the ongoing reporting of the provider's compliance data without further CME (III). We retrospectively analyzed the compliance of 23,279 anesthetic drugs at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Compliance was defined as a patient with 1 risk factor for PONV who received at least 1 antiemetic, 2 risk factors who received at least 2 antiemetics, and 3 risk factors who received at least 3 antiemetics. Drugs of the same class were counted as a single dose of antiemetics. Propofol-based anesthetic techniques were counted as 1 antiemetic. Patients with 0 risk factors for PONV were not included. We estimated compliance rates for each of the 4 study periods, adjusting for multiple observations at the same clinician. Individual performance feedback was given once 6 months after Intervention I concurrently with a refresher presentation on PONV (beginning of Intervention II) and on an ongoing quarterly basis during Intervention III. RESULTS: Compliance rates were not significantly affected with CME (Intervention I) compared to baseline (54.5% vs. 54.4%, P=0.9140). A significant improvement occurred during the period when CME was combined with performance data (Intervention II) compared to Intervention I (59.2% vs. 54.4%, P=0.0002). Another significant improvement occurred when data alone was presented (Intervention III) compared to Intervention II (65.1% vs. 59.2%, P<0.0001). In patients with 3 risk factors, we saw a significant improvement in compliance rates during Intervention III (P = 0.0002). In the post hoc analysis of overtreatment, the percentage differences between baseline and period III decreased as the number of risk factors increased. CONCLUSIONS: We observed the greatest improvement in compliance with continuous personal performance feedback. Provider feedback can be a powerful tool to change clinical practice, but it can have unforeseen consequences.",0,1,
1312,Online interventions for social marketing campaigns to change health behaviors: a meta-analysis of psychological architectures and adherence factors,"BACKGROUND: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online interventions that encourage people to reduce their alcohol consumption, exercise more, and better control their weight. Motivations to develop eHealth interventions can be driven by the reach, interactivity, cost-effectiveness, and studies showing that online interventions work, of the Internet. However, when designing online interventions suitable for public campaigns, evidence-based guidelines are scarce, taxonomies are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and previous meta-analyses are not applicable to large-scale public campaigns aimed at voluntary behavior change . OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis evaluated design features of online interventions to inform the development of online campaigns, as employed by social marketers, that aim to encourage voluntary health behavior change. Another goal was to improve understanding of the relationships between intervention adherence, study adherence, and behavioral outcomes. Methods: Based on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 search terms in 5 bibliographic databases with additional gray literature searches was used. This resulted in 1271 abstracts and articles; 31 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 29 articles describing 30 interventions were included in the primary meta-analysis, with the 2 additional studies qualifying for the adherence analysis. The first analysis estimated the overall effect size, including groupings by control conditions and time factors. The second analysis assessed the impact of psychological design features, coded with taxonomies from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive technology, and other areas of behavioral influence. These separate systems were integrated into a coding framework model called the communication-based influencer component model. Finally, the third analysis assessed the relationships between intervention compliance and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: The overall effect of online interventions across all studies was small but statistically significant (standardized mean difference effect size d=0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.11-0.28, P<.001, number of interventions k=30). The greatest effect with moderate efficacy was achieved by online interventions compared to waitlists and placebo (d=0.28, 95% CI=0.17-0.39, P<0.001, k=18), followed by comparison with Low-tech online interventions (d=0.16, 95% CI=0.00-0.32, P=0.04, k=8);"" no significant difference was found compared to sophisticated print interventions (d = -0.11, 95% CI = -0.34 to 0.12, P = 0.35, k = 4), although online interventions proved to offer a small effect with the advantage of lower cost and more time emerged as a critical factor, with shorter interventions generally having greater impact and higher adherence design, most interventions were transtheoretical and goal-oriented, employed multiple influencing components aimed at showing users the consequences of their behavior in helping them achieve their goals to support and exert normative pressure d effectiveness of the intervention. Despite a conflicting correlation, the evidence suggests that study adherence, intervention adherence, and behavioral outcomes are correlated. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that online interventions have the ability to influence voluntary behaviors such as those routinely targeted by social marketing campaigns. The high reach and low cost of online technologies can set the stage for increased public health campaigns that combine online people-to-people systems with mass media reach. Such a combination of approaches could help individuals achieve personal goals that help citizens improve their quality of life at the individual level and contribute to a healthier society at the state level.",0,0,
1313,"Operational research as an implementation science: definitions, challenges and research priorities","Background Operational Research (OR) is the discipline of using models, either quantitative or qualitative, to support decision making on complex implementation problems. The methods of OR have been used in healthcare since the 1950s in various areas such as emergency medicine and the interface between acute and ambulatory care, hospital performance, planning and management of patient home visits, patient appointment planning, and many other complex implementation problems of an operational or logistical nature. Discussion So far, there has been limited debate about the role that operational research should play within implementation science. I describe three such roles for OR, all based on forward-thinking systems thinking: structuring implementation problems, prospectively evaluating improvement actions, and strategic reconfiguration. Case studies from mental health, emergency medicine, and stroke care are used to illustrate each role. I then describe the challenges for applied OR within implementation science at organizational, interventional, and disciplinary levels. Two key challenges are the difficulty in reaching a position of mutual understanding between implementation scientists and research users and a marked lack of evaluation of OR interventions. To address these challenges, I propose a research agenda to assess applied OR through the lens of implementation science, liberating OR from the specialized research and consulting environment, and co-creating models with service users. Summary Operational research is a mature discipline that has developed a significant body of methods to improve health services. OR offers implementation scientists the opportunity to think more upfront about the system before tying up resources or taking risks. OR has three roles within implementation science: structuring an implementation problem, prospective assessment of implementation problems, and a tool for strategic reconfiguration of healthcare services. Challenges facing OR as an implementation science include limited evidence and impact assessments, limited involvement of service users, lack of managerial awareness, effective communication between research users and OR modelers, and availability of health data. Advancing the science requires a focus on three key areas: evaluating OR interventions, embedding knowledge of OR in healthcare services, and educating OR modelers on the goals and benefits of engaging service users.",0,0,

The majority of respondents pointed to the relevance of ethics in various medical settings, although ethical issues were considered less important in specific areas such as public health and research involving animals. Patients' inability to attend regular follow-up and illiteracy were considered the main barriers to obtaining consent. Opinions about the amount of information to be imported to research participants as part of informed consent were at odds with standard guidelines. Physicians who reported taking an orientation course in medical ethics and those with prior research experience were more aware of ethical issues.

1317,Optimal treatment pattern in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"In healthy adults, there is an intimate relationship between the physiological processes of respiration and swallowing at all levels of neuromotor control and peripheral function. Little is known about the possible changes in these patterns in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet the impact of dysphagia and aspiration on the health outcomes of patients with COPD can be significant. COPD is a common comorbidity in patients with head and neck cancer and neurological disorders seen by swallowing physicians and requires consideration during swallowing management. This article summarizes reports of changes in nutritional status, airway defenses, and swallowing efficiency that may contribute to or exacerbate chronic and debilitating lung disease. To optimize the state of health of patients with COPD, care guidelines are given for modifying eating and swallowing behavior. The need for controlled clinical trials to validate the impact of these treatment guidelines on clinical outcomes is discussed.",0,0,

METHODS: We describe the rationale and methods of the Maternal and Child Health-Antiretroviral Therapy (MCH-ART) study, a scientific implementation project investigating strategies for delivering HIV care and treatment to HIV-infected women receiving ART during Pregnancy and its HIV-exposed infants. RESULTS: MCH-ART consists of 3 related study designs over the prenatal and postnatal period. Phase 1 is a cross-sectional assessment of consecutive HIV-infected pregnant women seeking antenatal care; Phase 2 is an observational cohort of all women from Phase 1 who are eligible to start ART according to local guidelines, and Phase 3 is a randomized study of strategies to provide ART to lactating women from Phase 2 onwards during the postpartum period. During each phase, a series of study measurement visits will be conducted separately from antenatal care and ART services. From the beginning of the prenatal care until 12 months after the birth, there are a maximum of 9 visits. At the same time, questions of ART adherence and retention are qualitatively examined in in-depth interviews, and the costs and economic efficiency of care models are examined. Separate sub-studies examine health outcomes in non-HIV infected women and their non-HIV infected infants, and the role of the adherence club model in long-term adherence and retention. DISCUSSION: The MCH-ART study combines observational and experimental components and presents a novel approach to understanding and optimizing ART administration for MCH.",0,0,
1319,Optimizing hypertension management in clinical practice,"There is a clear relationship between elevated blood pressure (BP) and various manifestations of cardiovascular disease. Despite the availability of numerous treatment guidelines, hypertension remains poorly controlled, with only a small proportion of patients achieving blood pressure goals. Many factors, both patient and physician related, contribute to this poor level of hypertension control. Key determinants include implementation of inappropriate treatment regimens that do not allow patients to achieve goal and poor patient compliance. For example, it is generally accepted that most patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to reach their blood pressure goal"";"" However, physicians may be reluctant to use such treatment strategies. The aim of this review is to examine factors that contribute to poor hypertensive control rate and how these can be overcome, including reasons for selecting combination therapy, with particular reference to angiotensin II receptor blocker combinations.",0,0,
1320,Optimizing the treatment of hypertension with combination therapy: considerations for the caregiver,"Hypertension is an important factor in the risk of cardiovascular disease and death, yet success in achieving blood pressure (BP) control has been limited. Most patients require 2 or more medications to control their blood pressure. Nurses play an important role in treating patients with hypertension and can help overcome obstacles to reaching blood pressure goals. Measures to improve adherence to therapy include educating the patient and simplifying the medication regimen. Use of single-pill combination therapy that reduces pill burden may contribute to improved medication persistence and compliance. Rational combination therapy combines drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, such as a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor"";"" it is often more effective than monotherapy and allows the use of lower doses of each component, usually resulting in better tolerability. Current guidelines support the first-line use of combination therapy in many patients. Initiating therapy with a combination of RAAS inhibitors may reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk and may be more effective in some patients than traditional combinations such as B. a beta-blocker with a diuretic. Adverse events associated with a drug can compromise its therapeutic usefulness. Peripheral edema is a common and dose-dependent adverse reaction observed with dihydropyridine CCBs, which can cause significant patient distress, reduce adherence to therapy, and lead to dose reduction or even discontinuation of therapy. In most cases, CCB-induced peripheral edema can be successfully treated and CCB therapy does not have to be discontinued.

1321,"Oral contraceptives and smoking, current considerations: recommendations from a consensus panel","In a closed session, the members of the consensus panel evaluated the presentations of the scientific panel and developed a set of recommendations. They outlined clinical imperatives related to identifying and educating smoking patients, the physician's role in smoking cessation, and prescribing oral contraceptives to smoking patients. They also outlined research goals for the future. The main suggestions are: All patients should be asked about their smoking status at each visit, and all smokers should be encouraged and supported to quit. The decision to prescribe an oral contraceptive requires a detailed personal and family history of thrombotic disease. In smokers over 35 years of age who use or require oral contraceptives, measurement of lipid profiles should be considered in addition to exercise and dietary intervention. Patients > 35 years of age who smoke heavily (> 15 cigarettes/day) should be refused oral contraceptives. Preliminary data suggest that an oral contraceptive containing the very low dose of ethinyl estradiol 20 micrograms may be safer for oral contraceptive users who smoke, even for those over 35 years of age who smoke occasionally, but these laboratory results require clinical confirmation Confirmation.""; "" PIP: This article summarizes the activities of a conference in Montreal, Canada entitled ""Oral Contraceptives and Smoking: Current Considerations"".

1322,Oral quinolones in hospitalized patients: an evaluation of a computer-assisted decision support intervention.,"objective. To determine if a computerized decision support system could increase the proportion of oral quinolone antibiotics ordered by hospitalized patients. Design. Prospective discontinuous time series analysis. Setting. University Hospital in the Southeastern United States. Subjects. Quinolone orders placed for inpatients from February 1, 2001 to January 31, 2003. Intervention. A web-based intervention was deployed on February 5, 2002 as part of an existing order entry system at a university hospital. Based on an automated query of medication and diet orders, a suggestion was made to some users who ordered intravenous quinolones to consider choosing an oral formulation. main outcome measure. The proportion of inpatient quinolone orders for oral formulations before and after the use of the intervention. Results. There were a total of 15,194 quinolone orders during the study period, of which 8,962 (59%) were for oral dosage forms. Orders for oral quinolones increased from 4202 (56%) before the intervention to 4760 (62%) after, with no change in overall orders. In the time-series analysis, there was an overall increase in weekly oral quinolone prescriptions due to the intervention of 5.6% (95% CI 2.8-8.4%; P<0.001), with the greatest impact on non-ICU medical units . Conclusions. A web-based intervention increased oral quinolone prescriptions in hospitalized patients. This is one of the first studies to show a significant effect of computer-assisted intervention on the dosing route within an antibiotic class. This model could be applied to other antibiotics or other drug classes with good oral bioavailability.",1,1,

1324,Orbital/periorbital plexiform neurofibromas in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: multidisciplinary treatment recommendations,"TOPIC: Children and adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a common autosomal dominant disease, present with a variety of ophthalmic disorders. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) affecting the eyelid, orbit, periorbital, and facial structures (orbital-periorbital plexiform neurofibroma [OPPN]) can cause significant vision loss in children. Equally important, OPPNs can cause a significant change in physical appearance due to proptosis, ptosis, and facial disfigurement, leading to social embarrassment and reduced self-esteem. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although NF1 is a relatively common condition that requires routine ophthalmological evaluation, there are no formal recommendations for the clinical management of children with OPPNs. Although medical and surgical interventions have been reported, there are no agreed criteria for when OPPNs require therapy and which treatment produces the best outcome. METHODS: Because a multidisciplinary team of specialists (oculofacial plastics, pediatric ophthalmology, neuroophthalmology, medical genetics, and neuro-oncology) guides managerial decisions, the lack of a consistent outcome measure representing visual or aesthetic outcomes complicates evidence design. based studies and feasible clinical studies. RESULTS: In September 2013, a multidisciplinary task force composed of pediatricians from tertiary care centers experienced in caring for children with OPPN was convened to address the lack of clinical management guidelines for children with OPPN. CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement provides recommendations for ophthalmic surveillance, outlines treatment indications and upcoming biologic therapies, and discusses challenges in conducting clinical trials in this complicated disease.",0,0,
1325,Organization of surveillance in GI practice,"BACKGROUND: Several reports have documented inefficient use of available resources and suboptimal compliance with monitoring recommendations. Although evidence suggests that organizational issues can affect the quality of care provided, surveillance protocols are usually based on disorganized approaches. METHODS: We performed a literature search (publication date: 01/2000-06/2016) on PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for guidelines or consensus statements, such as surveys of practice , patient reporting, or provider attitudes and behaviors for intervention studies to improve compliance. Related articles were also scrutinized. Based on the clinical relevance and burden of endoscopy services, this review focused on surveillance for Barrett's esophagus, IBD, and surveillance for colonic adenomas after polypectomy. RESULTS: Existing guidelines generally recognize structural and process requirements that influence the implementation of surveillance interventions, while less attention has been paid to transitions and interfaces in the care process. Available evidence from real-world surveys suggests the need to develop organizational strategies aimed at enabling patients to participate and providers to provide timely and appropriate care. However, well-designed studies evaluating the effectiveness of specific interventions in this setting are lacking. Indirect evidence from screening settings suggests that implementing automated standardized recall systems, utilizing clinical registries, removing financial barriers could improve appropriateness of use and adherence to recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of solid evidence on the utility and methodology of surveillance may help explain the observed variability in provider and patient attitudes and adherence to recommended surveillance.",0,0,
1326,Organizational theory for dissemination and implementation research,"Background Even under optimal internal organizational conditions, implementation can be undermined by changes in organizations' external environment, such as: B. fluctuations in funding, adjustments in contract practices, new technologies, new laws, changes in guidelines and recommendations for clinical practice, or other changes in the environment. Internal organizational conditions are increasingly reflected in implementation frameworks, but implementation research lacks differentiated explanations of how the external environment of organizations influences implementation success. Organizational theories offer implementation researchers a variety of existing, highly relevant, and hitherto largely unexplored explanations for the complex interactions between organizations and their environment. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of organizational theories for implementation research. Discussion We applied four well-known organizational theories (institutional theory, transaction cost economics, contingency theories, and resource dependency theory) to published descriptions of efforts to implement SafeCare, an evidence-based practice to prevent child abuse and neglect. Transaction cost economics theory explained how frequent, uncertain contracting processes for SafeCare may have led to inefficiencies and thus hampered implementation by private child protection organizations. Institutional theory explained how child care systems may have been motivated to implement SafeCare because it aligned with the expectations of key stakeholders in child care system professional communities. Contingency theories explained how efforts such as inter-agency collaborative teams promoted SafeCare implementation by facilitating adaptation to the internal and external contexts of child protection agencies. Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) explained how interagency relationships, supported by contracts, memorandums of understanding, and negotiations, facilitated SafeCare implementation by balancing autonomy and dependence on funding agencies and SafeCare developers. Summary In addition to the retrospective application of organizational theories outlined above, we advocate the proactive use of organizational theories to design implementation research. For example, implementation strategies should be selected to minimize transaction costs, promote and maintain congruence between organizations' dynamic internal and external contexts over time, while attending to organizations' financial needs while preserving their autonomy. We describe implications of applying organizational theory in implementation research to implementation strategies, evaluation of implementation efforts, measurement, research design, theory and practice. We also provide implementation researchers with guidance on how to apply organizational theory.",0,0,
1327,Educating about osteoporosis prevention: behavioral theories and calcium intake,"Osteoporosis is a global health problem. Preventing osteoporosis and subsequent fractures has become a goal of many medical professionals, particularly nutritionists. However, few prevention models have proven effective. The aim of this project was to determine whether an educational, theory-based osteoporosis prevention program would significantly affect calcium intake. This project used a sample of 42 women who participated in an 8-week educational activity similar to a community class. The program included hands-on self-efficacy activities and was based on the Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). The main endpoints were calcium intake and constructs from the Health Belief Model and TRA. Significant changes in the Health Belief Model and TRA constructs after the intervention included an increased perceived susceptibility to osteoporosis (P<0.001), perceived benefits of increased calcium intake (P<0.001), and increased self-efficacy related to calcium intake (P < 0.001). /=.003). Statistically significant regression equations were found for all preintervention intentions related to calcium.

DESIGN Randomized controlled trial embedded in a baseline cross-sectional body mass index (BMI) survey. Randomization and outcome measurement, but not participants, were blinded to group assignment. RECRUITMENT 45 general practitioner practices (66 general practitioners) in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 3,958 children who visited their general practitioner between May 2005 and July 2006 were asked about their BMI. Of these, 258 children aged 5 years 0 months to 10 years who were overweight or obese according to International Obesity Taskforce criteria were randomized to an intervention (n=139) or control (n=119) group. Children who were very obese (UK BMI z-score > or = 3.0) were excluded. INTERVENTION Four standard consultations over 12 weeks aimed at modification of diet, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle supported by specially designed family materials. Main Outcome Parameters The primary parameter was BMI 6 and 12 months after randomization. Secondary measures were the mean activity number/min after 7-day accelerometry, the nutrition score from a 4-day abbreviated food diary, and the child's health-related quality of life. Differences were adjusted for socioeconomic status, age, gender, and baseline BMI. RESULTS Of 781 eligible children, 258 (33%) participated in the study; the fluctuation was 3.1% after 6 months and 6.2% after 12 months. The adjusted mean differences (intervention - control) at 6 and 12 months for BMI were -0.12 (95% CI -0.40 to 0.15, P=0.4) and -0.11 (-0, 45 to 0.22, P=0.5); for physical activity in counts/min, 24 (-4 to 52, P=0.09) and 11 (-26 to 49, P=0.6);"" and for nutritional score, 0.2 (-0.03 to 0.4, P=0.1) and 0.1 (-0.1 to 0.4, P=0.2).There was no evidence of harm to the child.The costs to the health care system were significant in the intervention arm CONCLUSIONS Primary care screening followed by brief counseling did not improve BMI, physical activity, or diet in overweight or slightly obese 5- to 10-year-olds, and it would be very costly if mainstreamed Results conflict with national policy in countries such as the US, UK and Australia TEST REGISTRATION ISRCTN 52511065 (www.isrctn.org).",0,0,

DESIGN Cluster-randomized study embedded in a population-based survey. SETTINGS Three local governments in Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS Parents who participated in 12-month child health checks over a six-month period completed an initial questionnaire. At 18 months of age, children at or below the 20th percentile on an expressive vocabulary checklist participated in the study. INTERVENTION Maternal and child health centers (clusters) were randomly assigned to intervention (modified You Make a Difference program over six weekly sessions) or control (usual care) arms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was Expressive Language (Preschool Language Scale-4) at 2 and 3 years; the secondary outcomes were receptive language at 2 and 3 years, vocabulary checklist raw score at 2 and 3 years, expression vocabulary test at 3 years, and Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 raw score at 2 and 3 years RESULTS 1217 parents concluded completed the baseline survey, 1138 (93.5%) completed the 18-month checklist, while 301 (26.4%) children achieved vocabulary from 1.5 to the 20th percentile and were randomized (158 interventions, 143 controls ) 115 (73%) intervention parents attended at least one session (mean 4.5 sessions) and most reported high satisfaction with the program Intermediate outcomes at age 2 were similar to those at age 3 the adjusted mean differences (intervention-control) -2.4 (95% confidence interval -6.2 to 1.4; p=0.21) for expressive language and -0.3 (-4.2 to 3.7; p=0.90). ) for receptive language; 4.1 (-2.3 to 10.6; P=0.21) for vocabulary checklist; -0.5 (-4.4 to 3.4; P=0.80) for Expressive Vocabulary Test; -0.1 (-1.6 to 1.4; P=0.86) for externalizing behavior problems; and -0.1 (-1.3 to 1.2; P=0.92) for internalized behavior problems. CONCLUSION This community-based program targeting speech-deficient young children was feasible and acceptable, but little evidence was found that it improved language or behavior either immediately or immediately by age 3.

1331,"Overweight and obesity in pregnancy: the evidence-practice gap in relation to staff knowledge, attitudes and practices","BACKGROUND: Statewide (Queensland) clinical guidelines reflecting current best practice have recently become available for the treatment of gestational obesity. However, the dissemination of guidelines alone does not change practice. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the evidence-practice gap in multidisciplinary management of overweight and obesity (ow/ob) in pregnancy to inform an intervention that facilitates the translation of obesity guidelines into practice in a tertiary maternity service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey, available over a three week period (May-June 2011), was distributed to obstetricians, midwives and allied health workers. Outcomes of interest included a 15-point guideline adherence score, knowledge of guideline content, advice given, knowledge of obesity-related pregnancy complications, prior training, and referral patterns. RESULTS: 84 employees completed the surveys (57% response rate). Widespread discrepancy with guideline was noted. The majority (88.1%) identified overweight/obesity (ow/ob) as an important/very important common obstetric problem, with most correctly identifying associated complications. However, only 32.1% of the existing guidelines were known, with only half correctly identifying the BMI categories for ow/ob. Adherence to referral recommendations varied"";"" 20% of employees considered the transfer to be “not their job”. CONCLUSIONS: Staff are aware of the negative consequences associated with maternal pregnancy, although few fully comply with referral guidelines or provide advice as recommended. These outcomes are categorized using scientific methodological frameworks, and effective behavior change interventions are constructed to facilitate the translation of this important guideline into practice.",0,0,
1332,Oxygen therapy in hospitalized patients: the impact of local policies,"OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of local policies on the behavior of nursing and medical staff to optimize oxygen consumption in hospitalized patients. METHODS: The study was conducted in a district teaching hospital. Guidelines included suggested indications, monitoring, use of arterial blood gases (ABGs), and advice on when to stop oxygen therapy. The guidelines were implemented both verbally and in writing to all nursing and medical staff before and after an audit examining the oxygen consumption of patients on medical and surgical wards. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included in the pre-intervention audit and 59 in the post-intervention study. Oxygen prescription did not change with guidelines 30% (27/90) vs 32% (19/59). Nurses administered oxygen better 95% (18/19) vs 70% (19/27) (p=0.043) and monitored it more frequently with oximetry 91% (54/59) vs 69% (62/90) (p= 0.043). 0.001) according to the guidelines. In patients with respiratory disease, blood glucose levels were controlled more frequently 87% (14/16) vs 65% (15/23) on admission and after initiation of oxygen inhalation 68% (11/16) vs 34% (8/23) . CONCLUSION: The oral and written guidelines had no impact on oxygen prescribing but did improve the practice of closely monitoring patients with respiratory disease.

1333,The postoperative pain management practices of pediatric nurses in hospitalized non-ICU settings: a narrative review,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the postoperative pain management practices of pediatric nurses with the goal of identifying the factors associated with inadequately managed postoperative pain in children. DESIGN: Systematic search and review. DATA SOURCES: PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE and hand search. REVIEW METHODS: English peer-reviewed research articles on quantitative, qualitative, or blended methods published between 1990 and 2012 that examined the postoperative pain management practices of pediatric nurses were included. Articles that primarily focused on the pain management practices of nurses in the NICU or pediatric intensive care unit, the recovery room, and/or children with cognitive impairment were excluded. The search terms used were: ""postoperative pain"", nurses*; pediatrics; pediatrics; children; pain assessment; non-pharmaceutical*; analgesics*. Titles and abstracts were used for the initial screening. Two investigators each performed data extraction and rigor assessment RESULTS: Of the initial 248 citations, 27 studies were included. Most studies were descriptive, examining the relationships between personal factors and nurses' pain management practices. Observational data from four papers added insights beyond those provided in self-report studies. Two articles used experimental designs with vignettes. The data were categorized into four themes: pain assessment; pharmacological practices; non-pharmacological practices;"" and factors influencing the practices. Despite improvements in analgesic administration over the past 20 years, practices remain suboptimal. Children's behavior appears to influence nurses' assessment of pain more than validated interventions. In a significant proportion of the children, no pain scores were recorded in the first 24 hours after the operation. Children receive more painkillers when ordered around the clock than when they need them. However, around-the-clock prescription of analgesics did not guarantee administration. Nurses reported routinely using several non-pharmacological strategies, but some are not evidence-based. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicate that nurses' assessment and management of pain in children is inconsistent with published guidelines. The results of studies examining nursing and child-related factors are inconclusive. Research needs to examine the impact of organizational factors on nurses' pain management practices. Intervention studies are needed to identify the most effective strategies to support and improve caregivers' pain management of children.",0,1,
1334,Pain descriptors for critically ill patients unable to self-report,"OBJECTIVE: To examine descriptors used by nurses in two Canadian ICUs to document the presence of pain in critically ill patients who are unable to self-report. BACKGROUND: Systematic documentation of pain assessment is essential for communication and continuity of pain management, allowing for better pain control, maximizing recovery, and reducing physical and psychological sequelae. METHOD: A retrospective, mixed-method observational design in two Level III ICUs of a quaternary academic center in Toronto, Canada. In 2008-2009, data were abstracted by chart review guided by a reference compendium of potential behavior descriptors assembled from existing behavioral pain assessment tools. RESULTS: A total of 679 narrative descriptions were extracted. Behavioral descriptors (232.34%), physiological descriptors (93.14%), and descriptors indicating that the patient was pain-free (117.17%) were used to describe the presence or absence of pain. Reports also described administration of analgesics without descriptors of pain assessment (117.17%) and assessment and administration of analgesics prior to a known painful procedure (30.4%). Emerging themes included life-threatening treatment disorders, decision uncertainty, and a wakefulness continuum. CONCLUSION: Inconsistent or ambiguous documentation was problematic in this sample. This can reflect confusing behaviors and associated security priorities. The development of a lexicon of pain assessment descriptors from critically ill patients unable to self-report for use, combined with valid and reliable measures, can improve documentation and facilitate appropriate pain medication management. Unit protocols or policies that prioritize an attempt at analgesia over the administration of sedatives may reduce decision uncertainty when patients exhibit ambiguous behaviors such as agitation or agitation.",0,0,

1336,Parallel ways to improve heart failure outcomes: Evidence matters,"Gaps and inequalities in education about heart failure by caregivers and in the performance of patients with advanced heart failure in implementing self-care behaviors may be factors in clinical decompensation and unplanned health care utilization. Is nurse-led training conducted effectively prior to hospital discharge? Nurse leaders need to understand the strength of the nurses' knowledge base related to self-care principles and key barriers to best practice. Nurses may not feel comfortable teaching patients about dry weight, meal planning, heart failure medication, or progressive activity and movement steps. Additionally, clinical nurses may not have time to thoroughly educate patients prior to discharge. Equally important is research to identify factors that promote adherence to heart failure behaviors in patients, as adherence to the recommendations of national, evidence-based heart failure guidelines improves clinical outcomes. Therefore, caregivers and patients are on parallel paths to lay the foundation for improved adherence to self-care in advanced heart failure. Through research, we found that nurses were underprepared to be heart failure educators and that patients did not believe they were capable of controlling heart failure. In 2 educational intervention studies designed to teach patients that they could control their fluid management and maintain a strict daily fluid limit, patients showed improved clinical outcomes. Therefore, misconceptions about heart failure can be overcome with interventions that go beyond communicating “which” self-care behaviors are recommended. Research Shows Evidence Matters! Systems and processes are required to support the knowledge, convenience and frequency of caregivers in providing pre-discharge self-care training, increase the accuracy of patients' heart failure control beliefs, and increase patient desire to Adhere to guideline-recommended heart failure self-care behaviors. This article describes the development of the parallel paths of nursing and patient research programs and examines the translation of findings into practice and the development of clinical translational research.",0,0,
1337,Parental presence during invasive procedures and resuscitation: evaluating a change in clinical practice,"Rationale: The presence of parents during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation is a relatively underdeveloped and controversial practice. Much of the concern stems from the concern of the medical community. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether the implementation of formal practice guidelines and appropriate interprofessional training would improve clinicians' sense of preparedness and comfort in providing parents with options during their children's procedures. METHODS: Multi-phase pre-post survey on (1) clinician perceptions and (2) practice from the perspectives of clinicians and parents experiencing the same procedure. Data were collected over a 4-year period from a cardiovascular and critical care program at a US children's hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: More than 70% of the clinicians participated in the perception surveys (n = 782), and 538 clinicians and 274 parents participated in the practice surveys. After the procedure, physicians reported that parents were present for more invasive procedures and reported a greater level of comfort in the practice of offering parents options during CPR events. Comfort was higher for physicians who had practiced skills in a simulated learning environment. In both phases, few physicians reported that parental presence affected their technical performance (4%), therapeutic decision-making (5%), or ability to teach (9%). During the follow-up phase, clinicians reported more active parental behavior during the procedures. Parents who reported receiving information to help them prepare for their children's procedures reported higher levels of procedural understanding and emotional support. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of practice guidelines and interprofessional education had a positive impact on clinician perceptions and practice in offering parents options and support during invasive procedures and/or resuscitation of their children.",0,0,

PARTICIPANTS 153 parents from disadvantaged areas with children aged 36 to 59 months at risk of having a conduct disorder as defined by a score above the clinical cut-off of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory. Participants were randomized on a 2:1 basis, 104 to intervention and 49 to remain on the waitlist (control). Twenty (13%) were not followed up six months later, 18 from the intervention group. INTERVENTION The Webster-Stratton Fundamental Educational Program Incredible Years, a 12-week group-based intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Problem behavior in children and parenting skills as assessed by parental self-reports and by direct observation at home. Self-reported parenting skills, stress, and depression. Standardized and well-validated instruments were used throughout. RESULTS At follow-up, most measures of parenting and problem behavior in children showed significant improvement in the intervention group. Intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome measure, the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, showed a mean difference between groups of 4.4 points (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 6.9, P<0.001) on the problem scale with an effect size of 0.63, and a mean difference of 25.1 (14.9 to 35.2, P<0.001) on the intensity scale with an effect size of 0.89.

DESIGN An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial of the effectiveness of a group parenting program implemented by Sure Start in the community. SETTING Sure Start areas in North and Mid Wales. PARTICIPANTS Parents of 116 children aged 36-59 months (87% of the clinical sample) at risk of developing behavioral disorders as defined by a score above the clinical cut-off of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory). Children were identified by health visitors and recruited by the research team. INTERVENTION The Webster-Stratton Incredible Years basic parenting program or a six month wait list check. KEY OUTCOME MEASURE Incremental cost per unit of improvement on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory Intensity Score. RESULTS The bootstrap point estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £73 (€109, $142) per point improvement in intensity score (95% confidence interval £42 to £140). It would cost 5,486 (8,190 euros, US$10,666) to bring the child with the highest intensity score below the clinical cutoff and 1,344 (2006 euros, US$2,618) to bring the average child in the intervention group within the nonclinical Bringing limits on the intensity value (below 127). With a cap of £100 ($194) per point increase in the intensity score, there is an 83.9% chance that the intervention will be cost-effective. The average cost per child attending the parent group was £1,934 (EUR 2,887, $3,760) for eight children and £1,289 (EUR 1,924, $2,506) for 12 children, including initial costs and materials for training group leaders. When we divided the sample into relatively mild, moderate, and severe behavior groups based on baseline intensity scores, the intervention appeared more cost-effective for those at highest risk of developing a behavioral disorder. CONCLUSION This parenting program improved the child's behavior, as measured by the intensity score of the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, at a relatively low cost and was cost-effective compared to wait-list control. This parenting program has a modest cost and shows strong clinical impact, suggesting it represents good value for public spending.",0,0,

Methods: In a multi-site, randomized, controlled study, the effectiveness of motivational interviewing with brief structured counseling for smoking cessation and reduction in adolescents (n = 355) aged 14-18 years (55% female, 45% black, 12% Hispanic) . Treatment lasted 12 weeks, with follow-up visits at 24 weeks. Treatment completion was defined as the completion of all five counseling sessions. Study retention was defined as the completion of the 24-week assessment. Participant and study variables served as predictors of treatment completion and retention. Results: Overall, 79% of participants completed all five counseling sessions and the same percentage completed the 24-week assessment. Black race, pre-consideration period for reduction, and shorter time between baseline assessment and first counseling session were significantly associated with completion of treatment. For every 7.5 day delay in starting treatment after the baseline visit, the likelihood of completing all five treatment sessions decreased by 50%. Retention at 24 weeks was predicted by black race, younger age, better maternal education, college degree expectations, and structured brief counseling intervention. Conclusions: High treatment completion and study retention rates can be achieved in a multi-session behavioral smoking cessation intervention in adolescents. The results suggest that treatment should begin soon after the intake session to maximize treatment completion. Increased efforts to retain older adolescents and youth with lower academic aspirations and lower family incomes will be important in future studies.

1344,Participatory action research in antimicrobial stewardship: a novel approach to improving antibiotic prescribing in hospitals and long-term care facilities,"Changing the way physicians prescribe antimicrobials is a challenge. Although antimicrobial prescribing is determined by contextual (e.g., lack of guidelines), cultural (e.g., peer practice), and behavioral (e.g., perceived decision-making autonomy) factors, most antimicrobial stewardship programs do not consider these factors in their approach. This can lead to suboptimal effectiveness of the intervention. We present a new approach in antimicrobial stewardship program development that addresses relevant determinants of antimicrobial prescription: participatory action research (PAR). PAR is a collaborative process that aims to transform social situations by producing practical knowledge useful in local practice. It requires significant involvement of relevant stakeholders to address the determinants of the behavior being studied and to facilitate empowerment. PAR is well suited to complex problems in multidisciplinary settings as it adapts to local needs and provides a tailored approach to improve local practice. We describe how PAR can be applied to antimicrobial stewardship and describe the PAR design of two ongoing multicenter antimicrobial stewardship projects in acute care and long-term care, respectively.",0,0,

1347,Patient compliance with primary care physician recommendations for breast cancer screening: a historical cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in Israel, and routine screening is recommended for early detection. In 1997, a primary care center of a health management organization in rural Israel established a year-long program encouraging family doctors to remind their patients to get breast cancer screening. This study evaluates the impact of medical intervention on patient compliance. METHODS: Primary care physicians from two practices were asked to discuss the importance of early breast cancer detection with all eligible patients attending the clinic for any reason and to assist in scheduling an appointment for screening. The files of the patients who received the referral were stamped accordingly. Upon completion of the program, physician records were reviewed and potential breast cancer screening candidates were divided into two groups: those who had received the intervention (n=251) and those who had not received the intervention (n=187)”; The results were also compared to those of a third group of patients who had self-administered (ie, did not require intervention) prior to the study (n=100). A random sample of half the patients also completed an Ad -hoc questionnaire covering sociodemographic variables and the impact of medical intervention on their behavior.RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group showed significantly greater behavioral change related to breast cancer screening than controls (32% versus 13%, P=0.001). This change was particularly evident in the group of women aged 50-74 years who received the recommendation to have mammography (according to guidelines).CONCLUSION: Although this is a two-office study, the results suggest this that general practitioners significantly change the behavior of their patients with regard to regular breast examinations can change. The use of a specific reminder can also help the individual physician ensure that each patient has been properly instructed.",0,0,
1348,Patient representation and proactive care planning in the acute care hospital,"AIM: The aim of this study was to explain the role of patient advocacy in the advance care planning (ACP-ing) process. Nurses rank the prolongation of the dying process through inappropriate interventions as their top ethical concern and are concerned about the protection of patients' rights (Johnston et al. 2002). Paradoxically, codes of ethics assume that nurses have autonomy to uphold patients' healthcare choices. Advance directives (AD) to improve end-of-life care are rarely adopted, and acute care hospitals are generally not geared to the few patients they receive. The Respecting Patient Choices Program (RPCP) improves AD usage by providing a supportive framework for ACP-ing and primarily equipping caregivers as RPC advisors. Assisting patients in this process requires qualities consistent with patient advocacy and stem from the most fundamental principle of nursing, caring for others. DESIGN: Likert-scale survey conducted before and six months after the intervention on pilot and control groups, with matched focus groups. SETTING: Selected wards at a public acute care hospital in South Australia. TOPICS: Nurses at the pilot palliative care, respiratory, renal and colorectal and haem-oncology, coronary, cardiology and neurology/geriatric control wards. INTERVENTION: The RPCP during the 2004-2005 South Australian Pilot Project (RPCP). KEY FINDINGS: The organizational support of ACP-ing gave nurses autonomy to be patient advocates regarding end-of-life care, align clinical practice with their code of ethics, and alleviate the stress of inappropriately prolonging the dying process. RESULTS: Statistically significant survey results in the post-intervention group indicated that caregivers are experienced in: ""Encouragement to ensure patients can make informed decisions about their end-of-life care (84%)""; ability to maintain these desires in practice ( 73%); and job satisfaction from providing appropriate end-of-life care (67%),"" compared to approximately half (42-55%) of respondents in the pre-intervention and control groups. Focus group participants reported that that patients used to be difficult to advocate for, but now they can act legally and feel ethically comfortable about subsequent end-of-life care CONCLUSION: The results suggest that patient advocacy, facilitated by the supportive RPC environment, effects the ACP-ing process It is recommended that the RPCP be used as an integral part of the funding of high-quality security at the end of life and the associated job satisfaction is recognized and developed.",0,0,
1349,Patient and physician reminders to promote colorectal cancer screening: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Screening reduces colorectal cancer mortality, but effective screening tests are still underutilized. Systematic patient and physician reminders could increase screening rates Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial of patient and physician reminders in 11 ambulatory health centers. Participants included 21,860 patients aged 50 to 80 who were overdue for colorectal cancer screening and 110 general practitioners. Patients were randomly assigned to receive mailings that included an educational brochure, fecal occult blood testing kit, and instructions for direct scheduling of flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Physicians were randomly assigned to receive electronic reminders during physician visits with patients whose screening was overdue. The primary outcome was receipt of a fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy for 15 months, and the secondary outcome was detection of colorectal adenomas. Results Screening rates were higher in patients who received mailings than in those who did not (44.0% vs. 38.1%; p<0.001). aged 60-69 and +10.1% aged 70-80 (p=0.01 for trend). 47). However, electronic reminders tended to increase screening rates in patients with 3 or more primary care visits (59.5% vs. 52.7%; P=0.07). P=0.10) and physician recall (6.0% vs. 4.9%; P=0.09). Conclusions E-mail reminders to patients are a powerful tool to promote colorectal cancer screening, and electronic reminders to physicians can increase screening among adults who attend primary care more frequently.",1,1,
1350,Patient education on the subject of coughing: Effects on the counseling behavior of family doctor patients,"The aim of this general practitioner study was to investigate how the counseling behavior of patients with cough is affected when the tasks and responsibilities of patients, nurses and general practitioners are reorganized. The effects of a rational cough practice and a systematic cough education on the counseling behavior of the patients were compared with the patient behavior in four matched control practices in four “average” single-handed general practices. Behavioral changes were measured in 548 patients who consulted for cough at least twice in two consecutive autumn-winter periods. Significantly more patients in the experimental practice changed their behavior to follow practice guidelines than patients in the control practices (56% versus 30%, P<0.001). The proportion of patients who continued to consult in the approved manner was greater among patients who received an intervention (66% vs. 29%, P<0.001). This was equally true for patients who had fewer than four or more than four coughing attacks. The more often the patients received the information, the more effective it was. All patients who consulted the family doctor about cough in the first autumn-winter period filled out a cough diary in the second period. This showed that the intervention did not cause patients to delay consultation if they had a cough that lasted more than three weeks or a cough with ""severe"" symptoms. It appears that rational practice policies and the provision of patient education can encourage patients to change their counseling behavior. This could reduce healthcare costs.",0,0,
1351,Patient education for colorectal cancer screening: a randomized trial of a video sent prior to a physical exam,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer screening is underutilized and primary care physicians face challenges in providing patient education within the confines of busy practices. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of an educational video sent to patients' homes prior to a physical exam on the performance of colorectal cancer screening, particularly sigmoidoscopy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 5 primary care practices in central Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: 938 patients aged 50 to 74 years scheduled for an upcoming physical examination, had no personal history of colorectal cancer and were eligible for lower endoscopy screening under current guidelines. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n=488) or a video about colorectal cancer, the importance of early detection, and screening options (n=450). MEASUREMENTS: Telephone baseline and 6-month follow-up evaluations were conducted. A dependent variable classified as screening since baseline was 1) sigmoidoscopy with or without other tests, 2) another test or combination of tests, or 3) no tests. RESULTS: The overall screening rates were the same in the intervention and control groups (55%). In regression modeling, intervention participants were not significantly more likely to perform sigmoidoscopy alone or in combination with another test (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.70]). The intervention dose (watching at least half of the video) was significantly associated with performing a sigmoidoscopy with or without further testing (odds ratio 2.81 [CI 1.85 to 4.26]). Recruitment records showed that at least 23% of those who presented for regular health assessments were currently being evaluated by a lower endoscopy procedure and were therefore ineligible. LIMITATIONS: The primary care sample studied consisted primarily of white, middle-class individuals who had high screening rates at baseline. The results may not generalize to other populations. The study was conducted at a time of increasing health insurance for lower endoscopy procedures and increasing media attention to colorectal cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Video sent by mail did not affect the overall rate of colorectal cancer screening and only slightly improved sigmoidoscopy screening rates in patients in primary care offices.",0,0,
1352,Patient engagement programs for the detection and initial treatment of depression in primary care,"Significance Encouraging patients in primary care to address symptoms of depression and engage with physicians could improve outcomes, but may also result in unnecessary treatment. Aim To determine whether a depression engagement video (DEV) or customized interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) improves initial depression treatment compared to a control group without increasing unnecessary antidepressant prescriptions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial comparing DEV, IMCP, and control among 925 adult patients treated by 135 general practitioners (603 patients with depression and 322 patients without depression, as defined by Patient Health Questionnaire C9 [PHQ-9] score) ) conducted from June 2010 to March 2012 at 7 primary care clinical sites in California. Gender- and income-targeted interventions DEV, an IMCP tailored to individual patient characteristics, and a sleep hygiene video (control). Key outcomes and measurements Among depressed patients, assessment of the superiority of the composite measure of patient-reported antidepressant recommendation, mental health referral, or both (primary outcome)""; depression at 12 weeks of follow-up, as measured by the PHQ-8 (secondary Outcome). Among non-depressed patients, non-inferiority assessment of clinician- and patient-reported antidepressant recommendations (primary endpoints) with a non-inferiority margin of 3.5%. Analyzes were cluster-adjusted. Results Of the 925 eligible patients, 867 were included in the primary endpoint Analysis (depressed: 559; non-depressed: 308) to 8.9], p=0.79 IMCP vs. control 9.9 [95% CI, 1.6 to 18.2], p=0.02 ) There were no effects on the PHQ-8 measured depression score at 12 weeks of follow-up: DEV vs. control: 0.2 (95% CI, 1.2 to 0.8), IMCP vs. control: 0, 9 (95% KI, Δ0.1 to 1.9). In nondepressed patients, physician-reported antidepressant prescription in the DEV and IMCP groups was non-inferior to the control group (mean percentage point difference [PPD]: DEV vs. 0.0499 for non-inferiority, IMCP vs. control, 3rd .3 [90% CI, 9.1 to 2.4], P=0.02 for non-inferiority); Patient-reported antidepressant recommendation did not reach non-inferiority (mean PPD: DEV vs. control, ≥ 0.9 [90% CI, ≥ 4.9 to 6.7], P ≥ 0.23 for non-inferiority; IMCP vs. control, ≥ 0.3 [90% CI , ?5.1 to 5.7], P?=?.16 for non-inferiority) Conclusions and Relevance Tailored IMCP increased clinical recommendations for antidepressants, mental health referral, or both in depressed patients but had no effect on mental health at 12 weeks follow-up The possibility that IMCP and DEV increased patient-reported clinical recommendations for an antidepressant in non-depressed patients could not be ruled out.",0,0,
1353,Patient perceptions of risky drinking: knowledge of daily and weekly guidelines for low risks and standard drink sizes,"BACKGROUND: An effective intervention for risky drinking requires clinicians and patients to be aware of the daily and weekly low-risk guidelines and what constitutes a “standard drink”. The authors hypothesized that most patients lack this knowledge and that education is needed. METHODS: After primary care visits, patients completed anonymous baseline questionnaires containing the 3 alcohol use detection test-use questions (AUDIT-C): ""How many drinks (containing alcohol) can you safely drink in a day?"" and questions to the size of a standard beverage of wine, beer and spirits in ounces. Descriptive analyzes were performed in Stata. RESULTS: Of 1,331 respondents (60% female, mean age: 49.6, SD = 17.5), 21% screened positive for risky drinking in the AUDIT-C. Only 10% of these low risk estimated daily limits accurate, 9% accurate to weekly limits and half of the low risk estimated limits at or below guidelines. Less than half who ticked 'yes' to 'Do you know what a 'standard drink' is? provided accurate answers for beer, wine or spirits. Patients who screened positive were twice as likely to say they knew what a standard drink is, but only a third gave accurate guesses. When asked about plans to change their drinking habits over the next month, 23% with a positive AUDIT-C said they were at least considering making a change. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients in primary care are unaware of the specifics of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for low-risk alcohol use. Examining patient perceptions of low-risk guidelines and current drinking behavior can reveal discrepancies worth discussing. For high-risk drinkers, most of whom are unfamiliar with daily and weekly low-risk guidelines or standard drink sizes, education can be critical when intervening. The results suggest the need for detailed and explicit social marketing and communication about what exactly safe drinking entails.",0,0,
1354,Patient safety research: a review of the global evidence,"Background Unsafe medical care can result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite inaccurate estimates of the extent of the problem. To better understand the magnitude and nature of the problem of unsafe care, the WHO World Alliance for Patient Safety commissioned a review of the worldwide literature on patient safety research. Methods Important patient safety issues were identified through a consultative and investigative process and categorized within the framework of structure, process and outcomes of unsafe care. Leading experts examined current evidence and identified major knowledge gaps related to issues in developing, transition and developed countries. The report was reviewed by internal and external experts and improved based on the feedback. Results Twenty-three important patient safety issues were examined. Much of the evidence on the consequences of unsafe care comes from developed countries, where prevalence studies show that between 3% and 16% of hospitalized patients are harmed by medical care. Data from transition and developing countries also indicate considerable damage from medical care. However, significant knowledge gaps about the structural and procedural factors underlying insecure care worldwide make finding solutions difficult, especially in resource-poor settings. Interpretation Damage caused by medical care seems to impose a significant burden on the world's population. However, much of the evidence base comes from developed countries. Understanding the scope and solutions for unsafe care for the rest of the world is a critical component to delivering safe and effective care to all citizens of the world.",0,1,
1355,Patient Safety: The Physician's Perspective,"Medical error can be defined as the failure of a planned action to complete as intended, or the use of an incorrect plan to achieve a goal. Aside from their economic and human cost, errors result in a loss of patient confidence in the healthcare system and reduced satisfaction for both patients and healthcare professionals. There are many evidence-based, safety-focused behaviors and interventions that are easy to implement, such as: In vascular access, the development of patient safety research has raised a variety of issues that need to be addressed in order to provide an optimal patient safety approach. Patients are key contributors to their own safety, and therefore physicians should develop a new approach to include them in the decision-making cycle at every step of their treatment. Along this path, there are many opportunities for the patient to engage in safety behaviors and for the access team to ensure such behaviors through the use of simple strategies. The advent of the access center based on multidisciplinary teamwork has increased the potential for improving patient safety by preventing errors in the planning and execution of access surgeries, avoiding delays in treating access disorders, and improving communication between team members. However, significant research efforts are still needed to implement an intervention through evidence-based data with a focus on patient safety.",0,0,
1356,Patient-carried card prompts versus computer-generated prompts to remind general practitioners to perform health maintenance procedures.,"Background: We compared the effectiveness of a computer-generated notice placed on the front of the patient record versus a patient-carried notice card to remind physicians to perform selected health maintenance interventions. METHODS: A randomized, prospective, single-blind study was conducted in private practice in rural eastern North Carolina, involving 28 general practitioners and nine general internists. Twenty-two physicians were randomly assigned to the computer-prompted group and 22 to the card-prompted group. Four physicians in the computer group did not complete the study because of computer software problems, and three physicians did not complete the study because their limited staff was unable to enter patient data into the computer. Prior to the procedure, 20 patient records (10 males and 10 females) were reviewed by each physician for influenza vaccination history, stool occult blood count, pap smear, physician-performed breast exams, and mammograms. One year after the start of the intervention, the record reviews for the above five items were again performed on 20 different patient records for each physician. Results: There was a 7% increase in influenza vaccination performance in the card group (17% vs. 24%) compared to a 6% increase in the computer group (20% vs. 26%). There was a 5% decrease in occult blood stool performance in the card group (28% vs. 23%) compared to a 1% increase in the computer group (30% vs. 31%). Pap smear performance decreased by 11% in the card group (26% vs. 15%) compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (23% vs. 26%). Physician breast exam performance decreased by 2% in the card group (35% vs. 33%) compared to a 3% increase in the computer group (30% vs. 33%). Finally, there was a 3% increase in mammography performance in the card group (22% vs. 25%) compared to an 11% increase in the computer group (15% vs. 26%). Conclusions: Our data show a greater increase in the performance of health maintenance tasks in the computer-assisted group. The performance of stool for occult blood, Pap smear, medical breast exams, and mammograms was increased more in the computer-assisted group than in the card group. However, there was no statistically significant difference after the intervention for any of the tested health maintenance items, neither for the computer group nor for the map group. Overall, health-preserving measures were only carried out in a minority of suitable patients. (Arch Intern Med. 1994"";""154:1957-1960)",0,1,
1357,Patients with gout adhere to curative treatment when adequately informed: proof-of-concept observational study,"INTRODUCTION: Many physicians believe that patients with gout are unwilling to receive uric acid-lowering therapy (ULT) and blame it for poor adherence. AIM: To test the effectiveness of a complex intervention for gout that incorporates key elements of the current guidelines, including full patient information, delivered in an optimal setting (specialist clinic). METHOD: Observational study of patients reporting persistent gout attacks recruited from primary care lists. 106 participants (94 males, 12 females; mean age 61 years) were enrolled in the study. Patients received a predominantly nurse-led intervention that included education, individualized lifestyle counseling, and appropriate ULT. The predefined goal was to achieve serum uric acid (SUA) levels</=360 mumol/L at 1 year in at least 70% of participants. RESULTS: Of the 106 participants at baseline, 16% had tophi, the mean (SD) SUA level at baseline was 456 (98) micromol/L. All participants agreed to a shared aspiration to confirm gout and all wished to receive ULT. At 12 months, 92% of the 106 participants had achieved the therapeutic goal (SUA </=360 micromol);"" 85% had SUA < 300 micromol/L. Allopurinol was the most commonly used ULT and required a mean dose of 400 mg daily, to achieve goal Improvements in Short Form-36 were observed at 1 year (significant for pain) CONCLUSION: A predominantly nurse-led intervention, including education, lifestyle counseling, and ULT, may be the recommended treatment goal in more than 9 out of 10 patients Elaborate explanations and discussions about the nature of gout and its treatment options, as well as the individualization of management, are likely responsible for this success.",0,0,
1358,"Pearls, dangers, and pitfalls in the assessment and treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adolescents","PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: To provide clinicians with an updated overview of important considerations related to the clinical evaluation and management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: The American Psychiatric Association's recently revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 included significant changes in the diagnostic criteria for ADHD in adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recently revised their Clinical Practice Guidelines for ADHD”; While previous guidelines focused on children aged 6-12, the new guidelines extend to 17 years of age. An understanding of these revised diagnostic criteria and clinical guidelines is essential for pediatricians and others caring for adolescents. In addition to an updated overview of the clinical approach to the assessment and treatment of ADHD in adolescents, current knowledge regarding common comorbidities, psychosocial risks and long-term outcomes are briefly described. SUMMARY: Diagnosing and treating adolescents with ADHD presents unique challenges and obstacles. Clinicians must use caution and judgment in evaluating a teenager with recent symptoms suggestive of ADHD, consider other conditions that might mimic ADHD, and common ones investigate comorbid diseases. Regarding the treatment of adolescents, the AAP recommends medication as the first-line intervention, noting that stimulants have a much broader evidence base and greater effect than non-stimulants. Although physicians today have a variety of drug formulations to choose from, they also need to be aware of the possibility of stimulant abuse and diversion.",0,0,
1359,Pediatric nurse managing child anxiety at a rural primary care clinic using the evidence-based COPE program,"INTRODUCTION: Anxiety is the most common mental disorder in children. Many communities have a shortage of mental health providers, and the majority of children with anxiety are not receiving the evidence-based treatment they need. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and impact of a short, seven-session cognitive-behavioral-building intervention, Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE), delivered to anxious children by a pediatric nurse practitioner in a primary care setting . METHODS: A pre-experimental, one-group, pre-test, and post-test design was used. RESULTS: Children who participated had a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms (13.88 points, SD = 17.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.13-28.89) as well as an increase in cognitive-behavioural knowledge coping skills (M=11.38, CI=5.99-8.26, P=0.00) and improved functioning (at school and at home).

DESIGN cluster randomized controlled. RECRUITMENT 20 GP practices in the east of the Republic of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS 395 patients (192 in the intervention group, 203 in the control group) and 29 peer supporters with type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTION All practices have introduced a standardized diabetes care system. The peer support intervention ran over a two-year period and included four elements: peer supporter recruitment and training, nine group meetings led by peer supporters in the participant's own primary care practice, and a peer retention plan -Supporters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES HbA(1c)"", cholesterol concentration, systolic blood pressure;"" and feel-good factor. RESULTS There was no difference between intervention and control patients at baseline. All practices and 85% (337) of the patients were followed up. At the two-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in HbA(1c) (mean difference -0.08%, 95% confidence interval -0.35% to 0.18%), systolic blood pressure (-3.9 mm Hg , -8.9 to 1.1 mm). Hg), total cholesterol concentration (-0.03 mmol/L, -0.28 to 0.22 mmol/L) or well-being (-0.7, -2.3 to 0.8). While at follow-up there was a trend towards decreases in the proportion of patients with poorly controlled risk factors, particularly for systolic blood pressure (52% (87/166) > 130 mmHg at intervention vs. 61% (103/169) > 130 mm Hg in the control), these changes were not significant. The process evaluation showed that the intervention was generally delivered as intended, although 18% (35) of the patients in the intervention group never attended group meetings. CONCLUSIONS A group-based peer support intervention is feasible in general practice, but the intervention was not effective when targeted to all patients with type 2 diabetes. While there has been a trend towards improving clinical outcomes, the results do not support the widespread adoption of peer support.

Resident data also included self-efficacy and outcome expectations related to functional tasks and exercise, social support for exercise, and subjective and objective information about functioning and physical activity. The NA data included self-efficacy and outcome expectations, knowledge, and performance of functional nursing. RESULTS: Residents were predominantly female, white, and widowed; needed support in activities of daily living; and dealt with very little PA based on subjective and objective reports. NAs were predominantly female and black, had more than a decade of nursing experience, had strong self-confidence but limited knowledge of function-based nursing, and performed that nursing in 76% of the observed nursing interactions. There were no site-specific differences between NAs in beliefs, knowledge, or implementation of function-based care. Location-specific differences in the residents were shown with regard to self-efficacy for functioning; functional performance; social support for movement from experts;"" and from family, person-environment fit, and PA, based on subjective surveys. No differences were found, based on actigraphy Locations could benefit from ongoing education on how to increase PA among residents and help them comply with current PA guidelines to optimize overall health.",0,0,
1362,Performance of the TREAT decision support system in an environment with low prevalence of resistant pathogens.,"Objectives To evaluate a decision support system (TREAT) to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy in an environment with low prevalence of resistant pathogens. Methods A retrospective study of TREAT was conducted at the University of Copenhagen, Hvidovre Hospital. The patient cohort included adults with systemic inflammation and suspected community-acquired bacterial infection. The empiric antimicrobial treatment recommended by TREAT was compared to the empiric antimicrobial treatment prescribed by the first attending clinical physician. Results Of 171 recruited patients, 161 (65 with microbiologically documented infections) met the TREAT inclusion criteria. The coverage achieved by TREAT was significantly higher than that achieved by clinical practice (86% versus 66%, P=0.007). There was no significant difference in the cost of future resistance between the treatments chosen by TREAT and those chosen by the physicians. Direct expenditure on antimicrobials was higher in TREAT when patients without antimicrobial treatment were included, while there was no significant difference otherwise. The side effect costs were significantly lower with TREAT. Conclusions The results of the study suggest that TREAT can improve the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy and reduce adverse event costs in regions with low prevalence of resistant pathogens, albeit at the expense of increased antibiotic use.",0,1,
1363,Perioperative care map improves adherence to best practices for morbidly obese people,"BACKGROUND: Morbid obesity can complicate perioperative management. Best practice guidelines have been published but are typically only followed in bariatric patients. Little is known about the awareness of and adherence to these clinical recommendations by non-bariatric surgeons. Our study examined whether an educational effort could improve physician acceptance and adherence to established best practices for all surgically treated patients with morbid obesity. METHODS: In 2013, a best practice care card for morbidly obese patients was distributed to all surgeons and anesthesiologists in 4 teaching hospitals. In 2012 and 2015, pre- and post-intervention surveys were sent to participants to assess changes in clinical practice. A post-intervention chart audit determined physician adherence to distributed guidelines. RESULTS: In the study, 567 physicians completed the survey in 2012 and 375 physicians completed the survey in 2015. After the intervention, statistically significant improvements were seen in the percentage of surgeons and anesthesiologists combined who reported changing their management of morbidly obese patients undergoing surgery Adherence to best practices preoperatively (89% vs. 59%), intraoperatively (71% vs 54%), postoperatively (80% vs. 57%) and overall (88% vs. 72%). Results were similar when surgeons and anesthesiologists were analyzed separately. A chart review of 170 cases from the 4 hospitals revealed that 167 (98%) cases met best practices. CONCLUSION: After distribution of the treatment cards, the percentage of physicians reporting that they had changed their management to conform to best practices improved significantly. These results underscore the positive impact that this educational activity can have on physician behavior. Further research is needed to assess the impact of this intervention on clinical outcomes.",0,0,

Aggression can be particularly difficult to manage because it poses a risk of harm to formal and informal caregivers, and the options for medical intervention are complex and situational. Although several guidelines for anger management in dementia are available in the literature, their scope is widespread and proposed treatments often vary, making decision-making difficult for busy clinicians. Using a composite case as a model, the current article provides guidelines that guide outpatient providers through the steps needed to provide effective treatment for aggression in people with dementia. Shifting the current focus of care for patients with aggressive dementia towards a more person-centred approach will have a positive impact on patient care.

1366,Pharmaceutical care in chronic kidney disease: experience at the University Hospital Grenoble from 2006 to 2010,"BACKGROUND: Clinical pharmacists (CPs) specifically manage follow-up of laboratory tests, adjust drug dosing according to guidelines, and assess cardiovascular risk factors and deterioration in renal function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of clinical-pharmaceutical services in outpatient renal clinics. METHOD: Medical history and current treatment were recorded for each patient. Each intervention has been classified according to the Act-IP document of the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy. This tool provides identifications and guidelines for preventing and resolving drug-related problems (DRPs). RESULTS: From January 2008 to April 2009, 42 patients who saw the CP on at least 2 visits were enrolled in the study. We observed 350 pharmaceutical consultations and 263 interventions. Affected pharmaceutical interventions: untreated indication (30%), underdosing (25.9%) and overdosing (18.3%). The CP interventions consisted of: adjusting doses (42.2%) and adding treatments (31.9%). The major drugs involved were related to the cardiovascular (33.1%), digestive-metabolic (28.6%), and hematopoietic (21.6%) systems. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of a CP in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is necessary for the identification and prevention of DRPs. In addition to the medical improvement of CKD patients, the CP is involved in the development of prescription recommendations and therapeutic education programs for patients. In addition, redefining the roles and practices of clinical team members has proven their effectiveness in optimizing the care of CKD patients. In addition, patients' entry into dialysis is being postponed, leading to a reduction in health insurance costs.",0,0,
1367,Pharmacoeconomic implications of measuring and modifying hospital drug use,"Patterns of drug use impact hospital-based health care in a variety of ways. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) account for about 5% of admissions and compromise care for about 20% of hospitalized patients, while inadequate drug therapy compromises outcomes and prolongs hospital stays. Conversely, the appropriate use of medication can promote recovery and increase the quality of care. Well-documented examples include the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and postoperative wound infections. Accordingly, the optimization of drug consumption represents an important quality assurance issue alongside determining the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. Drug Utilization Review (DUR) requires all elements of the quality assurance process. In practice, therapeutically meaningful and cost-effective exercises can only be carried out if the relationship between drug use patterns and clinical outcomes is known. These measurement methods are currently speed-determining in quality assurance. There are several ways in which hospital drug use can be measured. These range from readily available and relatively cheap quantitative methods to methods that require the availability of skilled personnel. There is a succession of processes that involve increasing costs and increasing resource requirements, resulting in more and more detailed information being obtained. This sequence begins with pharmacy purchases, followed by pharmacy issues related to specific clinical areas, prescription or treatment sheet review, clinical record review, and finally the reports of trained investigators working in the clinical area. The simpler methods can provide useful information and an efficient basis for selecting and planning definitive studies. Once a category of drug use is appropriately earmarked for intervention, drug use can be modified through planned intervention with improvement in clinical outcomes and reduced economic costs in many cases. The intervention strategies for modifying drug use can be classified as re-education, persuasion, facilitation, and power strategies. Other models for implementing behavior change were considered, including the impact of trained investigators and the use of online computer prescribing with interactive software with appropriate guidelines. The challenge is to achieve sustainable change when interventions are implemented. Cost-effective quality assurance of drug use is possible with modest resources if impact-oriented measures are prioritized.",0,0,
1368,Pharmacological treatment of insomnia: An evidence review for a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians,"Background: Pharmacological interventions are often prescribed for sleep disorders. Purpose: To evaluate the benefits, harms, and comparative efficacy of pharmacological treatments for adults with insomnia. Data sources: Multiple electronic databases (2004–September 2015), reference lists and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents. Study selection: 35 randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks duration evaluating pharmacotherapies available in the United States and reporting effects on population or sleep; 11 long-term observational studies reporting harm information; FDA review data for non-benzodiazepine hypnotics and orexin receptor antagonists and product labels for all drugs Data Extraction: Data extraction by a single investigator, endorsed by a second reviewer, assessment of risk of bias by two investigators, consensus determination of weight of evidence Data synthesis: eszopiclone, zolpidem and Suvorexant improved short-term overall and sleep outcomes compared to placebo, although absolute effect sizes were small (low-to-moderate-strength evidence) Evidence for benzodiazepine hypnotics, melatonin agonists, and antidepressants, and for most pharmacologic interventions in older adults was insufficient or low strength. Evidence was also insufficient to compare efficacy within or between pH armacotherapy classes or versus behavioral therapy. The evidence of adverse effects reported in the studies was assessed as insufficient or low.” Observational studies suggested that use of hypnotics for insomnia was associated with an increased risk of dementia, fractures, and serious injury. The FDA documents reported that most pharmacotherapies presented risks for cognitive and behavioral changes, including impaired driving and other side effects, and recommended dose reductions in women and older adults. Limitations: Most studies were small and short-lived, and accepted People who met strict criteria participated. Minimum significant differences in outcomes were often not found or reported. Few data were available for many treatments. Conclusion: Eszopiclone, zolpidem, and suvorexant may improve short-term overall and sleep outcomes in adults with insomnia, but comparative efficacy and long-term efficacy of pharmacotherapies for insomnia are unknown Related are d with rare but serious damage.

1369,Pharmacologic treatment of low bone density or osteoporosis to prevent fractures: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians,"Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the available evidence on various pharmacologic treatments to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. METHODS: Published literature on this topic was reviewed using MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006), the ACP Journal Club database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (without date limitation), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (without date limitation), websites of the United Kingdom National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (without date limitation) and the United Kingdom Health Technology Assessment Program (January 1998 to December 2006). The search was limited to English-language publications and human studies. Search keywords included terms for osteoporosis, osteopenia, low bone mineral density, and the drugs listed in the key questions. This guideline assesses the evidence and recommendations according to the ACP clinical practice guidelines assessment system. Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that physicians offer pharmacologic treatment to men and women with known osteoporosis and those who have sustained fragility fractures (Grade: Strong Recommendation”; high-quality evidence). Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that physicians consider pharmacologic treatment Men and women at risk for developing osteoporosis (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) Recommendation 3: ACP recommends that clinicians Benefit assessment of choosing between pharmacological treatment options for osteoporosis in men and women in individual patients (grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

1371,Pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder in children and adolescents,"It is increasingly recognized that bipolar disorder often first appears in adolescence. Preadolescents with volatile behavior and severe mood swings also represent a large group of patients whose difficulties may lie on the bipolar spectrum. However, the majority of scientific effort and clinical trials for this condition are focused on adults. This overview summarizes the complexity of bipolar disorder and the diagnosis of the disease in young people. It then reviews the principles of pharmacotherapy, assesses current treatment options, and highlights areas where evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Recent developments have expanded the range of possible treatments for bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, differences in the phenomenology, course and consequences of bipolar disorder in young people force greater attention to the benefits and risks of therapy for those affected by the early onset of this disease. By summarizing current research and opinions on diagnostic issues and treatment approaches, this review aims to provide an update on a clinically important but controversial topic.",0,0,
1372,Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder at the turn of the millennium,"In the last 21 years, since SP was included in the diagnostic nomenclature, there has been a significant increase in knowledge about effective pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. The SSRIs have emerged as the first-line pharmacological treatments, although good evidence supports the efficacy of benzodiazepines”; MAOIs;” and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and pregabalin. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of the novel antidepressant venlafaxine and also optimism about the potential benefit of nefazodone and possibly bupropion. However, there are many areas that require further investigation. The publication of the RUPP anxiety study demonstrating the effectiveness of fluvoxamine in socially phobic adolescents has attracted a lot of attention. Given that SP begins in childhood and adolescence, more data are needed to support the use of pharmacotherapy in this age group, as early intervention can prevent the consequences of chronic SP. More research needs to be done on what is required for socially phobic individuals who achieve a good response to pharmacotherapy to progress to complete remission status. Additional research is needed to assess the comparative efficacy of different drug classes and to develop an improved ability to predict treatment response to a particular type of treatment. In addition, further research on treatment resistance is needed. For most anxiety disorders studied, the combination of CBT with a psychopharmacological treatment has shown little benefit over either treatment alone. These results may be due to methodological problems. Research needs to be done into how treatments can be sequenced to maximize the benefits of combining the two types of effective treatments. Finally, many clinicians are seeing an emerging trend of individuals who have had untreated SP their whole lives and are now presenting for treatment in their ""golden years."" The currently established treatments need to be further evaluated in this geriatric population.",0,0,
1373,Pharmacy Asthma Care Program (PACP) improves patient outcomes in the community.,"Background: Despite national disease management plans, optimal asthma management in Australia remains a challenge. Community pharmacists are ideally placed to implement new strategies aimed at ensuring asthma care meets current standards of best practice. The impact of the Pharmacy Asthma Care Program (PACP) on asthma control was evaluated using a multisite, randomized intervention study design versus a repeated measures control study. METHODS: Fifty Australian pharmacies were randomized into two groups: intervention pharmacies introduced PACP (an ongoing cycle of assessment, goal setting, monitoring and review) to 191 patients over 6 months, while control pharmacies provided usual care to 205 control patients. Both groups completed questionnaires and performed spirometric tests at baseline and 6 months later. The main endpoint was asthma severity/control status. Results: 186 of 205 control patients (91%) and 165 of 191 intervention patients (86%) completed the study. The intervention resulted in improved asthma control: patients receiving the intervention were 2.7 times more likely to improve from severe to not severe than control patients (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.64 to 4 .37; p<0.001). The intervention also resulted in improved adherence to therapy (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.30; p?=?0.03), a reduced mean daily dose of reliever medication (difference -149.11 µg, 95 % CI -283.87 to -14.36; p?=?0.03), a shift in the medication profile from reliever therapy alone to a combination of prevention, reliever therapy with or without a long-acting beta-agonist (OR 3.80, 95 % CI 1.40 to 10.32; p?=?0.01) and improved risk of non-compliance scores (difference -0.44, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.18; p?=?0 .04), quality of life (difference -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.00; p?=?0.05), knowledge of asthma (difference 1.18, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.63 ; p<0.01) and perceived control over asthma questionnaires (difference -1.39, 95% CI -2.44 to -0.35; p<0.01). There was no significant change in spirometric measurements in either group. Conclusions: A pharmacist-provided asthma care program based on national guidelines improves asthma control. The sustainability and implementation of the program within the healthcare system has yet to be explored.",0,1,
1374,Physical activity on prescription (PAP) from a general practitioner perspective - a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Prescription physical activity (PAP) is a successful intervention to increase physical activity in patients with sedentary lifestyles. The method appears to be little used by General Practitioners (GPs) and there is limited information on GPs hiring to consult using PAP as a tool. The aim of the study was to explore and understand the importance of prescribing physical activity from the general practitioner's point of view. METHODS: Three focus group interviews were conducted with a targeted sample of 15 Swedish general practitioners in southern Sweden. Participants were invited to share their experiences of using PAP. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified four categories: Tradition makes it difficult to change attitudes, Shared responsibility is needed, PAP has low status and is viewed with suspicion, and Lack of procedures and clear policies. Traditionally, GPs talk to patients about the importance of increased physical activity, but do not prescribe physical activity as a treatment. Medical training focuses on the use of medicines. Responsibility for patients' physical activity levels is shared with other healthcare professionals, patients and society. General practitioners express reservations about prescribing physical activity. A heavy workload is a source of frustration. PAP is viewed with suspicion and seen as a task of lower value and status. Using a prescription to highlight an elevated level is considered redundant, and GPs feel it should be administered by someone else in the healthcare system. Skepticism about the result of the method was also expressed. CONCLUSIONS: There is uncertainty regarding the use of PAP as a treatment due to the physicians' lack of training in non-pharmaceutical methods. GPs do not see the written referral as a priority and rather refer to other professionals in the healthcare system to prescribe the PAP. The GPs pointed out the need to establish routines and precautions in order for the method to gain credibility and become common practice among GPs.",0,0,
1375,Physician counseling for adolescents on smoking: who is counseled and who benefits most?,"PURPOSE: The Clinical Practice Guidelines direct physicians to ask their patients about smoking and to discourage tobacco use. Physicians are urged to pay particular attention to ethnic minorities and youth, as these groups are at increased susceptibility to smoking. Research into race and medical advice against smoking have produced conflicting results. The aim of this study is to clarify the relationships between physician communication about tobacco, race and smoking among adolescents. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined (1) racial differences in rates of physician communication and (2) whether the relationship between physician communication and smoking among adolescents was moderated by race. Multiple measures of smoking status were used (e.g., intention to quit, attempts to quit, relapse status). We used a large (N=5,154), predominantly African American (82.9%) sample of 11th grade students. RESULTS: Regular smokers were more likely to be screened for smoking. African Americans were more often discouraged from smoking than Caucasians. Among African Americans, non-smokers were the most likely to be both screened and counseled"";"" Among Caucasians, normal patients were most likely to be examined and counseled. Overall, medical intervention was associated with greater benefits for young African Americans, including fewer intentions to smoke, a greater likelihood of quitting, and fewer relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Physician communication about smoking may hold particular promise for African-American teenagers because it reduces health disparities due to racial differences in smoking-related mortality and morbidity. Physicians should be encouraged to screen and advise on tobacco in all young people, regardless of race or smoking status.",0,0,
1376,Physician and patient predictors of evidence-based prescribing in heart failure: a multi-stage study,"BACKGROUND: The management of patients with heart failure (HF) must take into account variable and complex individual clinical characteristics. Guidelines recommend the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAAS-I) at target dose. But physicians do not seem to follow this recommendation sufficiently, while little is known about physician and patient predictors of adherence to therapy. METHODS: To study the coherence of knowledge and self-perceived competencies of primary care physicians (PC) regarding RAAS-I with their respective prescribing behavior in relation to patient-associated barriers. Cross-sectional follow-up study after a randomized medical-educational intervention study with a seven-month observation period. PC doctors (n = 37) and patients with systolic heart failure (n = 168) from practices in Baden-Württemberg. Knowledge (blueprint-based multiple choice test), self-perceived competencies (questionnaire on global confidence in the therapy and frequency of use of RAAS-I) and patient variables (age, gender, NYHA functional status, blood pressure, potassium level, renal function). The prescription was collected from the documentation of the studies. The outcome variable consisted of >/=50% of the recommended RAAS-I dosage assessed by two-level logistic regression models. RESULTS: Patients (69% male, mean age 68.8 years) had symptomatic and objectified left ventricular (NYHA II vs. III/IV: 51% vs. 49% and mean LVEF 33.3%) and renal (GFR/=50 %). Determinants of improved prescribing of RAAS-I were patient age (OR 0.95, CI 0.92-0.99, p=0.01), overall physician confidence at follow-up (OR 1.09, CI 1, 02-1.05, p=0.01) and NYHA class (II vs. III/IV) (OR 0.63, CI 0.38-1.05, p=0.08) CONCLUSIONS: A change of physician confidence as a predictor of RAAS-I dose increase is a new finding that may reflect an intervention effect of improved physicians' intent and that may encourage new strategies to improve safe evidence-based prescribing. These should include alignment to knowledge, attitudes and skills.",0,0,
1377,Willingness of physicians and patients to pay for electronic cardiovascular disease management,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important target for electronic decision support. We investigated the potential sustainability of an electronic CVD management program using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Our aim was to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) of physicians and patients for the current and expanded programs. METHODS: Focus groups, expert input, and literature reviews decided the attributes to be evaluated for physician and patient DCEs performed using a web-based program. Estimated preference coefficients from hierarchical Bayesian analysis for each respondent and latent class analysis segmented each sample. Simulations were used to estimate the WTP for each of the attributes individually and for an improved vessel management system. RESULTS: 144 participants (70 physicians, 74 patients) completed the DCE. Overall, speed of access to updated records and monthly payments for a care coordinator were the most important determinants of physician choice. Two distinctly different segments of physicians were identified - one highly sensitive to the monthly subscription fee and the speed of updating the tracker with new patient data, and the other highly sensitive to the monthly care coordinator costs and government billing incentives. Patient choice was most significantly influenced by annual subscription cost. The physician's estimated WTP was slightly above the estimated sustainability threshold, while the patient's WTP was below. CONCLUSION: Current willingness-to-pay for electronic cardiovascular disease management should encourage innovation to achieve economies of scale in program development, delivery, and maintenance, and to meet sustainability thresholds.",0,0,
1378,Physicians' attitudes towards the proliferation of optical spectroscopy equipment for cervical cancer screening: an industrial-academic collaborative study,"BACKGROUND: Optical spectroscopy has been evaluated for biological plausibility, technical efficacy, clinical efficacy, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify healthcare provider attitudes or practices that might act as barriers to the spread of this new technology. METHODS: As part of an academic-industrial partnership, we conducted a series of focus groups to examine the barriers physicians face in optical diagnosis. The study was carried out in 2 stages. First, a pilot group of 10 physicians (8 obstetricians, gynecologists, and 2 general practitioners) were randomly selected from 8 regions of the United States and each physician was interviewed individually. Physicians were presented with the results of a large study (N=980) testing the accuracy of a spectroscopic device in detecting cervical neoplasia. They were also shown a prototype of the device and had time to ask questions and get answers about the device. They were also asked to provide feedback on a questionnaire, which was then revised and submitted to three larger focus groups (n=13, 15, and 17 for a total of N=45). The larger focus groups were conducted during national scientific meetings with 20 obstetrical gynecologists and 25 primary care physicians (GPs and internists). RESULTS: When asked about the dissemination potential of the new cervical screening technology, all study groups tended to rely on established clinical guidelines from their respective professional societies with regard to the screening and diagnosis of cervical cancer. In addition, study participants unanimously agreed that real-time spectroscopy would be viewed favorably by their patients. Participants were positive about the potential of the new technology as an adjunct to colposcopy and agreed that the improved accuracy would result in lower healthcare costs (due to fewer biopsies and fewer visits). Although all participants recognized the potential of real-time diagnostics, there were many perceived obstacles. These obstacles included changes in planning and workflow, liability, documentation, ease of use, length of training, equipment costs, and reimbursement from third-party payers. CONCLUSIONS: There are barriers to the spread of optical technologies in medical practice. These need to be addressed before cervical screening and diagnostic programs can use spectroscopy-based tools to fight cancer.",0,0,
1379,Physician behavior in the management of pediatric chronic conditions: association with health outcomes and treatment adherence,"OBJECTIVE: Physician behavior is an important but understudied influence on child and parent adherence to therapy. METHOD: To address this need, research was reviewed in the following thematic areas: children's and adolescents' perceptions of physician behavior in the management of chronic diseases in children; parents' perceptions of physician behavior in the management of chronic diseases; Physician compliance with pediatric guidelines Management of chronic diseases; the sharing of information by physicians about the management of chronic diseases in children; the relationship between physician behavior and adherence to therapy;"" and interventions to improve physician management of pediatric chronic diseases. RESULTS: The results underscore discrepancies between parental and adolescent needs and physician behavior, as well as inconsistencies in physician behavior, including adherence to practice guidelines, that may limit children's adherence to medical treatment.However, the results of interventions to improve medical management of pediatric asthma have been promising.CONCLUSIONS:Future research should be guided by a comprehensive model of physician behavior in chronic disease management that includes contextual determinants (e.g., culture and socioeconomic status), identified clinically relevant intervention goals, and documented the impact on health outcomes Chronic disease management approaches that involve physicians in active communication, support, and decision-making with children with chronic diseases and their parents should be developed and evaluated.",0,0,
1380,Physician intervention and patient risk perceptions in smokers with acute respiratory disease in the emergency department,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory illnesses account for over 12 million visits to emergency departments in the United States each year. Between a quarter and half of these patients are smokers. We assessed the incidence of physician intervention to quit smoking in patients with acute respiratory disease in the emergency department and examined the impact of physician intervention on patients' perceived risk of smoking and motivation to quit. Methods: This study was conducted in the emergency department of a large inner-city hospital. Adult smokers (n = 63) presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory disease were interviewed in the emergency department through a baseline interview. The frequency and extent of smoking interventions by physicians were studied using the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guidelines as a model. We also assessed patients' perceptions of risk from smoking, the presence of other smokers in the household, and patients' motivation to quit smoking. RESULTS: Emergency department physicians provided an incomplete and conflicting intervention for smoking. While most patients reported being asked if they smoke, only half of smokers were advised to stop smoking. Only 9% were offered help when quitting. Risk perception was generally low, however, the majority of smokers were willing to seek on-site smoking cessation counseling during their stay in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The small sample size in this study requires that the results be interpreted with caution. However, the results of this study suggest that the emergency department can provide a unique “teachable moment” in which to initiate smoking cessation counseling for this high-risk population.",0,0,
1381,The physician's involvement in the management of obesity as a primary condition,"As the obesity epidemic escalates, more and more patients suffer from serious comorbidities associated with being overweight. Obesity should be recognized and treated as a primary disease that is progressive, chronic and relapsing. Effective treatment of obesity has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. Physician involvement is required for medical assessment, management, counseling, and coordination of multidisciplinary management of obesity. Obese patients who are consulted by physicians and engaged for weight management are significantly more likely to participate in weight management programs than those who are not. Obesity treatment guidelines and materials are available from various health organizations. A comprehensive weight management program must include dietary changes, increased physical activity, and behavior changes. Dietary changes should take into account the energy content, composition, and suitability of the diet for the individual patient. The physical activity component should be safe and practical, including aerobic activity, strength training, and increased daily lifestyle activities. Various behavioral strategies allow the patient to make lifestyle changes that promote weight loss and management. Adjunctive therapies can be used to support lifestyle changes in severe or resistant cases of obesity. Models for multidisciplinary care differ depending on whether they are designed for a single doctor's office or as part of the healthcare delivery of a larger facility. Lifestyle changes for healthy weight management must be permanently incorporated into a patient's daily lifestyle to reduce obesity and its associated health risks. Such intervention is necessary if the growing obesity epidemic is to be slowed and reversed.",0,0,

A randomized study of continuing medical education,"To determine the impact of continuing medical education (CME) on compliance with the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel recommendations on high serum cholesterol in adults, we randomly assigned primary care physicians at 174 practices into 3 groups, 2 who adhered to either a standard or subjected to a standard examination intensive CME and a control group. The Standard CME group was offered a free 3-hour High Serum Cholesterol seminar, while the Intensive CME group was offered additional follow-up seminars and free stationery. After 18 months, we reviewed 13,099 medical records from 140 practices. There were no significant differences (P > 0.15) in screening for high serum cholesterol or in compliance with guidelines between the groups that received continuing medical education (51% screening; 33% compliance) and the control group (57% screening;"" 37% agreement). In the pre-specified subgroup of patients with hypercholesterolaemia, there was a trend towards a modest benefit from the further training measures: compliance was 21% in the control group, 23% in the standard CME group and 27% in the intensive care CME group (P=0.07 overall) These results underscore the need for better behavior change opportunities among practicing physicians and the importance of investigating the implementation of health prevention recommendations.",0,0,
1383,Physician remuneration through salary or fee: Effect on the practice behavior of physicians in a randomized prospective study,"We used a local continuity clinic to prospectively compare the effects of salary and fee reimbursement on physician practice behavior. This model allowed physicians to be randomized into salary and fee brackets and to separate the impact of reimbursement from patient behavior. Physicians reimbursed by fees for services scheduled more visits per patient than employed physicians (3.69 visits vs. 2.83 visits, P less than 0.01) and saw their patients more frequently (2.70 visits vs. 2.21 visits, P less than 0.05). the 9-month study. Almost all of the difference was due to fee physicians treating more healthy patients than employed physicians (1.42 visits and 0.99 visits per enrolled patient, respectively, P less than 0.01). Analysis of the visits using the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines showed that fee-based physicians visited more patients for good child care than employed physicians because they missed fewer recommended visits and missed scheduled visits in excess of those recommendations. Fee physicians also provided better continuity of care than salaried physicians by attending a larger percentage of all their patients' visits (86.6% of visits vs. 78.3% of visits, P less than 0.05) and promoting fewer emergencies visits per admitted patient (0.12 visits vs. 0.22 visits, P less than 0.01). Physicians' interest in private practice, as determined by their career plans, correlated significantly with the total number of patients admitted (r = 0.48, p less than 0.05) and the total number of clinic patients served by each resident during the study were seen (r = 0.40 , P less than 0.05).

1385,Doctors' responses to a community-level study promoting prudent use of antibiotics,"PURPOSE: In an environment of numerous campaigns promoting the prudent use of antibiotics in children, it is important to identify effective strategies. We assessed physician responses to community-level intervention in terms of antibiotic prescribing, associated practices, and perceived effectiveness. METHODS: This study was a mixed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of a randomized, controlled, community-wide educational intervention in 16 communities in Massachusetts. Physicians in intervention communities received locally recognized guidelines, group training, and biweekly newsletters. Parents received materials at doctor's offices and in the mail at the same time. After the intervention, we conducted a postal physician survey and individual interviews to assess the effect of the intervention. We compared survey responses from interventional and control physicians and analyzed interview transcripts to provide detailed information on selected topics. RESULTS: Among the survey participants (n=168), 91% of the intervention physicians and 4% of the control physicians reported having received intervention materials. Doctors received information from several other sources. From 2000 to 2003, more intervention physicians than control physicians reported less antibiotic prescribing (75% vs. 58%, P=0.03), but there were no differences between groups in knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors that promote prudent encourage the use of antibiotics. Both groups were concerned about antibiotic resistance and reported ways to reduce their own prescribing. Physicians surveyed suggested frequent repetition of messages, brief written materials on specific topics for themselves and patients, and mass media advertising as the most effective strategies to reduce prescription. CONCLUSIONS: In several communities, an intervention in physician offices to promote prudent antibiotic prescribing reached its intended target audience, but physicians' self-reported attitudes and practices were similar in intervention and control communities. Campaigns that include repeated short, consistent reminders to multiple stakeholders may be most effective in ensuring prudent use of antibiotics.",0,0,
1386,Physician screening for multiple behavioral health risk factors,"BACKGROUND: Screening rates in primary care for individual behavioral health risk factors are well documented. However, such risk factors accumulate among individuals and populations. This article examines the number and types of behavioral risk factors reported by adults in the United States who reported being evaluated at their last routine medical evaluation. METHODS: The sample consisted of 16,818 adults from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey who reported having had a routine physical in the past year. Respondents completed questions about four behavioral risk factors (physical inactivity, obesity, cigarette smoking, hazardous drinking) and provider screening for behaviors related to those risk factors. RESULTS: Half of the sample (52.0%) reported having two or more of the four risk factors, and more than half (59.4%) were assessed for two or more risk behaviors at their most recent routine visit, although 28, 6% said they had been screened for none of them. Respondents who identified at least one risk factor were screened for an average of 57.7% of their own risk factors. Women, adults with lower income and education, and those aged 65 and over said they were screened for fewer of their risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: While guidelines for risk factor screening and intervention typically focus on single behavioral risk factors, most primary care patients have and are screened for more than one.

1387,"Physician, heal thyself: health maintenance behaviors among physicians","The aim of this article is to assess the need for health maintenance intervention programs aimed at physicians and patients. We compared adherence to health maintenance behavior by physicians (as patients) to a control patient population. An online survey was sent to the clinical and non-clinical basic science faculties of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC) School of Medicine and to the non-TTUHSC clinicians of the local county medical society. The survey included questions about basic demographics and recent participation in regular health maintenance strategies, including annual screening, influenza vaccination, colonoscopy, Pap smear, and mammography. Logistic regressions were performed to determine whether being a doctor had a significant association with the likelihood of participating in the health maintenance behavior outcomes listed above. This article shows that physicians are less likely than the general population to adhere to specific health maintenance guidelines: namely, annual checkups, colonoscopies, and mammograms. Pap smear rates did not differ between physicians and a control population, but physicians showed an increased likelihood of receiving an influenza vaccine.",0,0,
1388,Physician-industry relations. Part 1: Individual Doctors,"This is part 1 of a two part paper on ethics and physician-industry relations. Part 1 offers advice for individual physicians"";"" Part 2 gives recommendations to medical training providers and medical societies. Physicians and industry have a common interest in the further development of medical knowledge. Nonetheless, the physician's primary ethic is to promote the patient's best interests, while the industry's primary ethic is to promote profitability. While partnerships between physicians and industry can lead to impressive medical advances, they also create opportunities for bias and can lead to unfavorable public perceptions. Many physicians and medical trainees believe that they are not exposed to commercial influences. However, recent studies show that accepting hospitality and industry gifts, even drug samples, can affect judgments about medical information and subsequent decisions about patient care. It is up to the doctor to judge whether a gift is acceptable. A very general guideline is that it is ethical to accept modest gifts that advance medical practice. It is clearly unethical to accept any gift or service that obliges the physician to provide something in return. Conflicts of interest may arise from other financial ties between physicians and industry, whether with outside companies or their own companies. These ties include fees for speaking or writing about a company's product, payments for participating in clinical research, and referrals to medical resources. All of these relationships have the potential to influence a physician's attitudes and practices. This paper examines the ethical issues involved and provides guidelines for ethical business relationships.",0,0,

1390,Doctors' health habits are linked to lifestyle advice for hypertensive patients,"BACKGROUND: The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VII) recommended lifestyle interventions, either with or without pharmacologic treatment, for all patients with hypertension. The aim of this study is to determine the association between physicians' personal habits and their attitudes and behaviors in relation to the JNC VII lifestyle modification guidelines. METHODS: One thousand primary care physicians completed DocStyles 2010, a voluntary web-based survey designed to gain insight into physician attitudes and behaviors toward various health issues. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 45.3 years and 68% were male. In terms of medical behavior, 4.0% smoked at least once a week, 38.6% ate >/= 5 cups of fruit and/or vegetables >/= 5 days/week and 27.4% smoked >/= 5 days/ week sports. When asked about specific types of advice for their hypertensive patients, physicians said they would advise their patients to eat healthily (92.2%), reduce salt (96.1%), or achieve or maintain a healthy weight ( 94.8%). or limit alcohol consumption (75.4%) or be physically active (94.4%). Overall, 66.5% made all 5 lifestyle change recommendations. Non-smoking physicians were more likely to recommend any lifestyle intervention to their hypertensive patients. Those who exercised at least 1 day per week were more likely to recommend limiting alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who did not smoke and exercised at least 1 day per week were more likely to recommend all 5 JNC VII interventions.",0,0,
1391,Doctors' response to victims of domestic violence: towards a model of care,"While current domestic violence guidelines, such as those released by the AMA in 1992, attempt to relieve physicians of the ""full burden of intervention,"" they continue to urge physicians to play a large role in detection, intervention, and follow-up partner abuse. In this paper, we define a limited role for domestic violence physicians that advances the direction recommended by the AMA and complements exemplary programs. We propose simplifying and restricting physicians' responsibilities to ""question"" patients about abuse,"" provide affirmative notices, acknowledge beatings are wrong and affirm patient value, document signs, symptoms, disclosures, and sacrifice to specialists for Domestic Violence (AVDR) Using the literature and our own experience, we show how focusing the role of the physician on these four tasks is consistent with exemplary programs and expands healthcare professionals' ideas on addressing domestic violence, barriers to physician interventions casualties reduced; provides a realistic approach to physicians and reduces unrealistic educational requirements;"" and complements managed care trends in modern healthcare.",0,0,
1392,Physicians' understanding of the consent requirements for Phase I clinical trials in cognitively impaired or highly vulnerable populations,"We examined physicians' attitudes to enrolling patients who are unable to provide informed consent or who belong to a vulnerable population into clinical trials. A survey tool asked a nationwide sample of practicing physicians whether ten hypothetical patients could be enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial. The impact of demographic variables on the number of scenarios considered fully or reasonably acceptable was analyzed via Student's t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate. All significant (p<0.01) variables were entered into a multiple logistic regression model. 84% of respondents indicated that at least one case study was acceptable. A majority of those conducting clinical trials (62%), who had training in clinical research ethics (78%) and who sit on institutional review boards (IRBs) (83%) supported at least one case study. Physicians approved the participation in clinical trials of some patients who cannot give informed consent or who belong to a vulnerable population. Practitioners, residents and medical students should receive more effective education about clinical research guidelines. It should also be ensured that physicians conducting clinical trials or sitting in IRBs have the necessary knowledge of clinical research ethics.",0,0,

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Patients at risk for cardiovascular events who might benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were enrolled in a managed care system using electronic data -Organization identified and randomly divided into 2 groups. An information sheet with the relevant patient data and recommendations for prescribing the indicated medication was faxed to the outpatient physicians in the intervention group. In the control group, the data sheet did not contain the recommendation. Dispensed prescriptions were compared between the groups. RESULTS: More than 4000 visits were observed for each medication type. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers were dispensed at 7.1% of visits in the intervention group versus 5.7% in the control group (p=0.048) after the initial patient-physician contact. No significant difference was observed for statins (intervention, 8.1% vs. control, 7.7%). Data for all patient-physician encounters and both medications were combined in a logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was 1.19 for a prescription issued in the intervention group and 1.54 for 2 or more visits versus 1 visit. CONCLUSIONS: An automated system providing relevant data and tailored recommendations for care at the point-of-service slightly increased prescription dispensing rates. Targeting patient-provider encounters to change provider behavior is a challenge"";"" however, even small effects over time can lead to clinically important results.",0,1,
1395,"Electronic prompts at the point of care: a powerful way to increase compliance, demonstrate quality and improve outcome","BACKGROUND: Incentives based on quality indicators such as the core measures of the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP 1) promote the consistent implementation of evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice. Information systems with point-of-care electronic prompts (POCEPs) can facilitate the implementation of processes and benchmarking services. We evaluated the effectiveness of POCEPs on the rate of antibiotic administration within 60 minutes after surgical incision and the effect on outcome in a prospective observational study. METHODS: SCIP 1 compliance and the corresponding outcome variable (Surgical Site Infection [SSI]) were prospectively assessed over 2 consecutive 6-month periods before (A) and after (B) POCEPs implementation in a regional healthcare system. The secondary analysis extended the observation to two 12-month periods (A' and B'). A 2-year (C and D) sustainability phase followed. RESULTS: The 19,744 interventions included 9,127 and 10,617 interventions before (A) and after (B) POCEPs implementation, respectively. POCEPs increased adherence to SCIP indicators by 31% (95% CI, 30.0%-32.2%) from 62% to 92% (P 95%) in period B, with the mean SSI rates for all Periods were lower than the SSI rates before POCEPs (0.8%, 0.7% and 0.5% vs. 1.1% "";"" P 30% and were associated with an absolute risk reduction of 0.4% at the Incidence of SSI associated.",1,1,
1396,"Population-based interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection","BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 1999 there were 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also widespread in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV as of December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviors such as B. Frequent unprotected sex with multiple partners puts people at high risk for both infections, and there is strong evidence that traditional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have shown a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is also biological evidence that the presence of an STI increases HIV shedding and that STI treatment decreases HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute significantly to HIV prevention. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the incidence of HIV infection, the incidence of STIs, and the quality of STI management. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomized trials or reviews:1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 2003 using the search terms ""sexually transmitted diseases"" and ""human immunodeficiency virus infection""2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, in the latest edition of the Cochrane Library3) The subject registry of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.4) EMBASE Relevant conference abstracts were searched and reference lists of all reviews and primary studies were scanned . Finally, the authors of the included studies and other experts in the field were contacted as needed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in which the randomized entity is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies in which people were randomized were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies, with all disagreements resolved through discussion. The studies were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the same two reviewers, with details of randomization method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis, and number of patients lost to follow-up recorded using standard Cochrane Infectious Diseases guidelines became group. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment for all community members for STIs, the rate ratio of HIV infection was 0.97 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating that the intervention had no effect. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (increased syndromic management of STIs in primary care hospitals) was 1.2% compared to 1.9% in the control groups (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42– 0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95% CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. In the latest study by Kamali et al. the rate ratio of behavioral intervention and STI management compared to HIV incidence control was 1.00 (0.63-1.58, p=0.98). These are consistent with the Rakai data, which show no effects of the intervention. Incidence of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms in the intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95% CI 0.71-0.89), of trichmoniasis 0.59 (0.38-0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis 0.87 ( 0.74-1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis was 5% in the intervention community compared to 7% in the control community at the end of the study (adjusted re7% in the control community at the end of the study (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95% CI 0.54 -0.93).In Kamali et al., there was a significant decrease in the incidence of gonorrhea and active syphilis.Rate ratio for gonorrhea was 0.29 (0.12–0.71, p=0.016), active syphilis was 0, 53 (0.33–0.84, p=0.016) trend towards significance with intervention for condom use with the last casual partner""; rate ratio 1.27 (1.02–1.56, p=0.036) Quality of treatment: In Lima after training the Pharmacy assistants in the treatment of STI syndromes identified symptoms as attributable to an STI in 65% of standardized simulated patients (SSPs) who attended interventions and in 60% of SSPs who attended control pharmacies (p = 0.35) medications were in the me without a referral to a doctor most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p=0.61). Of the SSPs who offered medications, only 1.4% who attended intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those who attended control pharmacies (p=0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Likewise, only 15% and 16% of SSP visits offered any recommended medication. However, SSPs who attended intervention pharmacies were more likely to receive education and counseling (40% vs. 27%, p=0.01). No SSPs received partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, after intervention for caregivers in primary care clinics (reinforced STI syndrome management and provision of packs of recommended medications, condoms, partner cards, and patient information booklets), SSP were more likely to receive recommended medications in intervention clinics (83% vs. 12%, p<0.005 ) and more likely to have correct case management [with correct medication, partner cards, and condoms] (88% vs. 50%, p<0.005). There were no significant differences in the proportions who received appropriate advice (68% vs. 46%, p=0.06), experienced good staff attitudes (84% vs. 58%, p=0.07), and received confidential advice (92% vs. 86%, p=0.4). There was no clear evidence of an effect on treatment-seeking behavior, service utilization, or sexual behavior in any of the four studies. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterized by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly increasing prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and STIs are common. There is no evidence of any significant benefit from treating all members of the community. The addition of the Kamali trial to the existing evidence supports the data from the Rakai trial to no effect. However, there are other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that an accepted intervention can significantly improve the quality of services provided. The Kamali study shows an increase in condom use, a marker of improved risk-taking behavior. Further community-based randomized controlled trials testing a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such studies should aim to measure a range of factors, including health-oriented behavior and quality of care, as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.",0,0,

1398,Population-level intervention strategies and examples for childhood obesity prevention,"With obesity affecting approximately 12.5 million American youth, population-level interventions are warranted to support healthy behaviors. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of population-level intervention strategies and specific examples of interventions that illustrate ways to prevent and control childhood obesity through improving diet and physical activity behaviors. Information is aggregated into the environments in which children live, learn and play (early care and education, school, community, health care, home). Intervention strategies are activities or changes aimed at promoting healthy behaviors in children. They were identified from (a) systematic reviews; (b) evidence- and consensus-based recommendations, guidelines, or standards from non-governmental or federal agencies; and finally (c) peer-reviewed synthesis reports. Examples of interventions illustrate how at least one of the strategies was used in a specific setting. To identify examples of interventions, we considered (a) peer-reviewed literature and (b) additional sources with research-tested and practice-based initiatives. Researchers and practitioners can use this review when setting priorities and promoting integration across different settings and to find research- and practice-proven examples of interventions that can be replicated in their communities for childhood obesity prevention.",0,0,

The trophoblastic neoplasia of pregnancy is quite unique in its biological behavior and clinical management. Our preliminary results suggest that FDG-PET is potentially useful in selected trophoblastic neoplasms of pregnancy by providing accurate metastatic mapping of tumor extent in advance, monitoring response, and locating viable tumors after chemotherapy. The evaluation of a diagnostic tool like PET is usually done by comparing diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity, specificity, etc.), by using a more sophisticated receiver operating curve method, or by changing the treatment fraction. Evaluation of PET for clinical benefit is specific to the individual tumor and is an attractive new endpoint.",0,0,

DESIGN Epidemiological modeling study. ADJUSTMENT Data from National Diet and Nutrition Survey, Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey, Office of National Statistics, and health economic data from other published studies PARTICIPANTS Adults 25 years of age stratified by fifth socioeconomic circumstances. ACTION Total ban of trans fats in processed foods; improved labeling of trans fats; Ban trans fats in restaurants and takeaways. KEY TARGET ACTIONS Prevent or delay deaths from coronary artery disease; years of life gained; quality-adjusted life years gained. Political costs to government and industry;' political savings from cuts in direct health care, informal care and lost productivity. RESULTS A total ban on trans fats in processed foods could prevent or delay about 7,200 deaths (2.6%) from coronary heart disease between 2015 and 2020 and reduce inequality in mortality from coronary heart disease by about 3,000 deaths (15%). Actions to improve labeling or simply remove trans fats from restaurants/fast food could save between 1800 (0.7%) and 3500 (1.3%) deaths from coronary heart disease and reduce inequality by 600 (3%) to 1500 (7th %) reduce fatalities, making them half as effective at best. A full ban would have the largest net cost savings of around £265m ($361m, $415m) excluding reformulation costs, or £64m if significant reformulation costs occur outside of the normal cycle. CONCLUSIONS A regulatory policy to eliminate trans fats from processed foods in England would be the most effective and equitable policy option. Intermediate policies would also be beneficial. However, simply continuing to rely on industry to voluntarily reformulate products could have negative health and economic consequences.",0,0,

The MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from January 2000 to October 2014 were searched for peer-reviewed publications of PCTs with at least 100 subjects per treatment arm. Most PCTs in psychiatry assessed mental health services or psychosocial interventions rather than specific pharmacotherapies. Of 157 PCTs in psychiatry, 30 (19%) were in psychopharmacology, with a median of 2 publications per year and no increase over the observation period. The sample size ranged from 200 to 18,154"";"" only 11 studies randomized 500 patients or more. Psychopharmacology PCTs were equally likely to be funded by industry as public bodies. There were 10 PCTs with antidepressants in a total of 4206 patients (compared to at least 46 PCTs with antihypertensive drugs in a total of 208,014 patients). Some psychopharmacology PCTs used suicidal behavior, treatment discontinuation, or mortality as primary endpoints and provided efficacy and safety data that have influenced both practice guidelines and regulatory decisions. Real-world clinical trials can be an important source of information for clinicians, patients, regulators, and policy makers, but have been relatively underexploited in psychopharmacology. Electronic medical records and integrated practice research networks offer promising platforms for conducting PCTs more efficiently.",0,0,

To standardize and improve care for family members of these veterans, health care researchers worked with program leaders and rehabilitation specialists to implement a collaboration to improve the quality of family care. OBJECTIVE: To describe practice changes associated with the Family Care Collaborative intervention. DESIGN: Cross-site, mixed-method evaluation. PARTICIPANTS: Members of the interdisciplinary rehabilitation team (n=226) working at the four participating sites. INTERVENTIONS: The collaboration developed and implemented a web-based tool to standardize and promote family-centered care in a 6-month pilot project. RESULTS: Survey of family care providers, satisfaction with family care and perceived competence in working with families; specific changes in practice at each site; perception of collaborative work by providers and moderators; and a validated measure to predict the probability of success of the selected intervention. MAIN RESULTS: Family-centered practices and satisfaction improved at sites with lower baseline scores (P<0.05) and were equivalent at all sites after the pilot. Providers initiated specific family-centered practices, often starting in one location and spreading to the others through collaboration. Sites standardized family building and collaboration. Providers felt that the collaboration brought about a “culture shift” from patient-centered to family-centered care and saw the involvement of program leaders and health service researchers as critical to success. Values for the measure predicting successful implementation of the intervention beyond the pilot project were encouraging. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborations that bring together clinicians, program leaders, and researchers can be useful to facilitate complex change with interdisciplinary teams.",0,1,

This paper provides an overview of a method for improving evidence-based practice. It reports on the evaluation of a new type of occupational therapy agency, research leadership based on clinical practice, and suggests that the agency has the potential to bridge the gap between research and practice. Based on clinician feedback, research findings and implications for practice, the findings provide insight into the role of the research leader in promoting and improving the use of evidence-based practice. It is hoped that these findings will also benefit other areas considering the strategies and support needed to improve and invest in evidence-based practices.",0,1,
1407,Practice doesn't always make perfect: A qualitative study that explains why trying an educational toolkit hasn't improved quality of care,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a chronic disease commonly managed by primary care physicians, with the most common complication being cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical practice guidelines were developed to support physicians in the care of diabetics. We conducted a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a printed educational toolkit aimed at improving CVD management in diabetes in primary care and found no effect and indeed the possibility of some harm. We performed a qualitative assessment to examine the strategy used in this study to implement the guidelines and to understand its impact. This paper focuses solely on the qualitative results, as the quantitative results of the RCT have been reported elsewhere. METHODS AND RESULTS: All primary care practices in the province of Ontario were randomized to receive the educational toolkit in the mail in either Summer 2009 (intervention arm) or Spring 2010 (control arm). A subgroup of 80 primary care physicians (approximately 10% of the randomized and contacted practices with datasets on 1,592 randomly selected patients with diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease) then participated in a chart audit and reflective feedback exercise related to their own practice compared to the guideline recommendations. They were asked to fill out two forms (a pre-audit and a post-audit) to understand their level of knowledge of the guidelines before the exam, their expectations about their individual performance before the exam, and their thoughts on their exam results. In addition, individual interviews were conducted with thirteen other general practitioners. Textual data from interview transcripts and written comments from the pre- and post-examination forms were subjected to qualitative descriptive analysis to identify common themes and patterns. The analysis revealed four main themes: impressions of the toolkit, awareness was not the problem, 'It's not me, it's my patients', and chart audit as a more effective intervention than the toolkit. Participants did not consider the toolkit content or its dissemination strategy to be effective, indicating that they were aware of the guidelines prior to the process. However, their accounts also indicated that they may struggle to prioritize CVD management amid competing demands for their attention. When they received their chart audit results, many participants expressed surprise that they hadn't done better. They reported that the audit results would be an important motivator for behavioral change. CONCLUSIONS: The qualitative findings outlined in this paper provide important insights into why the intervention was not effective. They also show that physicians have an unperceived need for CVD management and that the chart audit served to identify deficiencies in their practice that they were previously unaware of. The results also indicate that new methods of intervention development and implementation should be explored. This is important given the high prevalence of diabetes worldwide"";"" Appropriate CVD management is critical to address the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.",0,0,
1408,Practice Feedback Interventions: 15 Suggestions for Optimizing Effectiveness,"Electronic practice records are increasingly being used to provide feedback to improve practices. However, there is evidence that, despite decades of experience, the effects of such interventions vary widely and do not improve over time. While there are guidelines on how to provide more effective feedback, they are spread across a wide range of disciplines and theoretical perspectives. and experience in providing, assessing, and receiving practice feedback identified 15 suggestions thought to be associated with effective feedback interventions. These suggestions are intended to provide practical guidance for quality improvement professionals, information technology developers, educators, administrators, and practitioners who receive such interventions. Designing interventions with these suggestions in mind should improve their impact, and examining the mechanisms underlying these suggestions will advance a stagnant literature.",0,0,

1410,Practice nurses' intentions to apply clinical guidelines,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that while nurses are increasingly using clinical guidelines to ensure higher quality of care, adherence to them varies widely. The utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to explain this variability in community care has not previously been explored. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports a study whose primary objective was to examine the usefulness of TPB in explaining variations in practice nurses' intentions to provide smoking cessation counseling in accordance with coronary artery disease guidelines. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a postal questionnaire. A 52-item questionnaire was sent to 48 nurses in England. The questionnaire was designed to assess the components of the TPB and included measures of intent to offer smoking cessation advice, self-reported past behavior, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral controls (PBCs), behavioral beliefs and evaluations, normative beliefs, and motivation Fulfill and control beliefs and evaluations. RESULTS: The TPB explained up to 40% of the discrepancies in the intention to offer smoking cessation advice. Attitudes and PBCs were the top predictors of intent. Among other elements of the TPB, indirect attitudes and indirect PBCs made significant positive contributions to explaining the variance in intent. DISCUSSION: Future studies of interventions to improve nurse adherence to clinical guidelines could attempt to address the elements identified as important factors in this study. Further studies are needed to examine the utility of the TPB in predicting office nurse behavior.",0,0,
1411,Practice parameters for the non-pharmacological treatment of chronic insomnia. A report from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint reported to doctors. Treatment traditionally involves medication. Behavioral approaches have been available for decades, but lack of physician awareness and training, difficulties in obtaining reimbursement, and questions about effectiveness have limited their use. These practice parameters review the current evidence for a variety of non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia. The available literature was analyzed using an accompanying paper that provides a background overview. The evidence was reviewed using previously reported American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria with reference to American Psychological Association criteria. Treatments contemplated include: stimulus control, progressive muscle relaxation, paradoxical intention, biofeedback, sleep restriction, multicomponent cognitive-behavioral therapy, sleep hygiene education, imagery training, and cognitive therapy. An improved experimental design has significantly advanced the process of evaluating non-pharmacological treatments for insomnia using guidelines outlined by the American Psychological Association (APA). Recommendations for individual therapies using the respective recommendation levels of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine are: Stimulus Control (Standard)"", Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Paradoxical Intention, and Biofeedback (Guidelines); Sleep Restriction, and Multicomponent Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (Options);"" Sleep hygiene education, imagery training, and cognitive therapy did not have sufficient evidence to be recommended as individual therapies. Optimal duration of therapy, who should administer the treatments, long-term outcomes and safety concerns, and the effect of treatment on quality of life are questions that warrant future research.",0,0,

To assess the practice-level impact of (1) a peer-leader physician intervention and (2) peer-leader interventions combined with the introduction of asthma nurses to facilitate care. And to compare the results to previously reported patient-level results from study participants. study setting. Data were included on children aged 5 to 17 years with asthma in 40 primary care practices affiliated with managed healthcare plans participating in the Pediatric Asthma Care Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) randomized study. study design. GP practices were randomly assigned to one of two care improvement arms or usual care. Automated claims data were analyzed for 12-month periods using a repeated cross-sectional design. The primary endpoint was to demonstrate that patients with persistent asthma were receiving at least one control drug. Secondary endpoints included controller delivery in all identified asthmatics, evidence of chronic controller use, and oral steroid delivery. Health service utilization outcomes included the number of outpatient visits and hospital events. main results. The proportion of children with persistent asthma prescribed controllers increased in all study arms. No effect of the interventions on the proportion of receiving controllers was found (peer leader intervention effect 0.01, 95 percent confidence interval [CI]: -0.07, 0.08""; planned nursing intervention effect -0.03, 95- Percent CI: -0.09, 0.02) A statistical trend towards an increased number of oral corticosteroid bursts delivered in interventional offices was noted Significant adjusted increases in outpatient visits from 0.08 to 0.10 Visits per child per year were observed in the first year of intervention, but only a statistical trend in these outcomes persisted in the second year of follow-up.No differences in in-hospital events were noted.Conclusions.This analysis showed a slight increase in outpatient asthma visits as an outcome of interventions to improve asthma care using automated data The lack of demonstrable effects on medications Practice-level practice-level use differs from the positive intervention effect observed in patient self-reported data from study participants. Analysis of automated data on non-participants adds information on the impact of practice-level strategies to improve care. The benefits of practice-level interventions may disproportionately benefit the subset of people participating in the study. The impact of such interventions may be less obvious at the practice or health plan level.",0,1,

1414,Upfront commitment to choosing low-value services wisely: a graded wedge cluster randomized trial.,"Background Little is known about how to discourage physicians from ordering low-value services. Our goal was to test whether clinicians who commit their future self (ie, pre-commit) to following Choosing Wisely's recommendations with decision aids could reduce potentially low-value orders. Methods We conducted a randomized 12-month step-wedge cluster study involving 45 primary care physicians and experienced practice providers in six adult primary care clinics of a group practice in the US, imaging uncomplicated headache and unnecessary antibiotics in acute sinusitis. Pre-committed clinicians received 1-6 months of pre-commitment point-of-care reminders, as well as patient education handouts and weekly resource emails to support communication about low-value services. The primary outcome was the difference between the percentages of control and intervention period visits with potentially low-value orders. Secondary outcomes were differences between the percentages of control and intervention period visits with possible alternative orders, and differences between the percentages of control and 3-month post-intervention follow-up periods of visits with potentially low-value orders. Results The intervention was not associated with a change in the percentage of visits with potentially low-value orders overall, for headache or acute sinusitis, but was associated with an overall increase of 1.7% in alternative orders (p=0.01). For low back pain, the intervention was associated with a 1.2% decrease (p=0.001) in the percentage of visits with potentially low-value orders and a 1.9% increase (p=0.007) in the percentage of visits with alternative instructions . No changes were maintained in follow-up. Conclusion The physician's upfront commitment to follow Choosing Wisely's recommendations was associated with a small, non-sustained decrease in potentially low-value orders for only one of three target conditions, and may have resulted in an increase in alternative orders.",1,1,
1415,Predicting physician guideline compliance: an assessment of motivators and perceived barriers,"BACKGROUND: Although clinical practice guidelines are widely recognized as best practices, provider compliance remains low. OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between providers' behavioral intentions and their adherence to practice guidelines; assessing the impact of perceived barriers that most impede compliance;"" and to examine the ability of factors in the Physician Guideline Compliance Model to predict intent to adhere to and comply with guidelines implemented at specific practice locations. METHODS: Survey research methods were used to assess the Effects of past histories (attitudes, subjective norms, past behaviors, and perceived behavioral control) on providers' intentions to comply with clinical practice guidelines and assessing compliance Provider Survey I was conducted at the time of guideline introduction and Survey II at 4 months performed after implementation.RESULTS:Behavior history and behavioral intention scores reflected positive responses to guideline use.Mean self-reported compliance behavior was 65%, while co mpliance was 54% according to chart review. Approximately 68% of the variance in physicians' behavioral intentions was explained by variables included in the Physician Guideline Compliance Model. A significant negative correlation was found between perceived barriers and self-reported behavior, but not between perceived barriers and behavior assessed by chart reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Some variables, particularly perceived barriers to guideline implementation, predicted a provider's practice intentions and self-reported behavior. Future guideline intervention efforts should identify and reduce these barriers to guideline adherence prior to implementation.",0,0,

DESIGN Prospective open-label cohort study using routinely collected data from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the score. PARTICIPANTS 2,540,753 patients aged 25-79 in the derivation cohort who contributed 16,436,135 person-years of follow-up and of whom 78,081 had an incidental diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; 1,232,832 patients (7,643,037 person-years) into the validation cohort with 37,535 onset cases of type 2 diabetes OUTCOME MEASURES A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the impact of risk factors in the derivation cohort and a risk equation for Males and females inferred in the final model were self-assigned race, age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend Deprivation Score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of Corticosteroids;' the outcome of interest was incident of diabetes recorded in general practice records. Calibration and discrimination measures were calculated in the validation cohort. RESULTS There was a four- to five-fold variation in type 2 diabetes risk between different ethnic groups. Compared to the white reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio was 4.07 (95% confidence interval, 3.24 to 5.11) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) for Pakistani women and 2.54 (2.20). to 2.93) for Pakistani men. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher risk rates than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women were at increased risk compared to the corresponding white reference group. In the validation data set, the model explained 51.53% (95% confidence interval 50.90 to 52.16) of the variation in females and 48.16% (47.52 to 48.80) of the variation in males. The risk score showed good discrimination with a D-statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) in females and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) in males. The model was well calibrated. CONCLUSIONS The QDScore is the first risk prediction algorithm that estimates the 10-year diabetes risk based on a prospective cohort study and takes into account both social disadvantage and ethnicity. The algorithm does not require laboratory testing and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public via a simple web calculator (www.qdscore.org).",0,0,
1417,Predicting hip fractures in older women: a prospective study,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relative importance of osteoporosis of the os calcis, cognition and mobility in the risk of later hip fracture in older women. DESIGN Prospective study of elderly women in residential care over two years. FACILITIES 21 private or 38 community residential homes for the elderly and 4 geriatric hospitals in Doncaster and Hull. PARTICIPANTS 1414 outpatient women aged over 69 in private, community or elderly care. Those who had bilateral hip surgery were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation Index (BUA), Clifton Assessment Procedure for the Elderly (for cognition), and mobility on a six-point scale and hip fracture over the following two years. RESULTS 73 women fractured their hips during the two years. Their mean age was not significantly different from that of the non-fracture women (85.3 (SD 5.6) vs. 83.9 (6.3)""; p=0.07), but their mean BUA index (40, 3 (19.3) vs. 50.9 (22.2) db/MH2) and the score for cognition (median 19 (interquartile range 10.5-27.0) vs. 24 (17-30)) were significantly lower (both p<0.001).These variables had independent associations with hip fractures.Women with fractures had a significantly lower score on the psychomotor component of the cognition test (4.5(1-8) v 7(2-10); p less than 0 .0025 and were significantly more mobile (1(1-3) v 3(1-6); p less than 0.02) Division of women into high, medium, and low scores on the BUA index and the awareness test yielded one group high risk (118 women) with low BUA index and low consciousness score, whose fracture incidence was 12.8%;"" in the lowest risk group (136 women) with high BUA index and high consciousness score re ug fracture incidence was only 1.5% (relative risk 8.4 (95% confidence interval -2.0 to 35.5). Further analysis showed that those at highest risk were additionally the most mobile, but that less mobile, well-aware women had a low incidence of fractures regardless of the BUA index (1.2%, high index, v 0.9%, lower Index). CONCLUSIONS Older women who were most at risk of hip fracture were those with a low BUA index, a low cognition test score, and high mobility. Improving bone strength and awareness in older women may reduce the incidence of hip fractures.",0,0,
1418,Predictors of colorectal cancer screening of patients enrolled in a managed care health plan,"BACKGROUND: Despite increasing recognition of the importance of colorectal cancer screening in reducing cancer mortality, national screening rates are low, indicating an urgent need to understand the barriers and remedies to underutilization of CRC screening tests. METHODS: Using results from independent cross-sectional telephone surveys of patients aged > or = 50 years who entered before (2000""; n = 498) and after (2003; n = 482) a quality improvement intervention for CRC screening within a large managed care plan, trends and predictors of CRC screening with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and/or endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) were examined from the patient perspective for each test, 23% for endoscopy and 22% for FOBT. In 2003, screening rates increased to 50% for all tests, 39% for endoscopy, and 24% for FOBT After discussing CRC with a doctor, the likelihood of having CRC screened (FOBT : odds ratio [OR], 2.09 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.47-2.96] Endoscopy: OR, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.67-3.26]; and each test: OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 2.06-3.96]) and reporting Ba Errors for CRC generally reduced the likelihood of being screened (FOBT: OR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60-0.95]; Endoscopy: OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60-0.92];” and each test: OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.80]). The 2 strongest determinants for obtaining CRC screening were provider influence and patient barriers associated with CRC screening in general, indicating the need for multi-level interventions targeting both provider and patient.",0,0,
1419,Predictors of fatigue 30 days after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline plus taxane in breast cancer,"PURPOSES/OBJECTIVES: To identify the predictors of fatigue 30 days after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and whether differences are observed between a behavioral sleep intervention and a healthy diet control group in predicting fatigue. DESIGN: Descriptive, exploratory secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Oncology outpatients in a Midwestern city. SAMPLE: 96 women, aged 29-83 years, 72% married, 95% white, diagnosed with stage I-IIIA breast cancer, receiving adjuvant anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a behavioral sleep intervention group or an attentional control group. Participants performed data collection before and during the peak and rebound days of the initial chemotherapy treatment cycle and after the last treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Fatigue, circadian activity rhythms, objective and subjective sleep-wake and objective and subjective activity-rest rhythms. RESULTS: Predictors of fatigue were shorter total sleep time before treatment, higher pre-treatment and peak fatigue, and less energy after waking on rebound days. In the control group, the predictors of higher fatigue were higher pre-treatment fatigue, higher body mass index, higher number of positive lymph nodes, and fewer daytime dysfunctions. For the intervention group, lower peak activity at the peak of initial treatment was a different predictor of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that participants in the sleep intervention group whose activity was sleep-balanced at the peak of initial treatment benefited most from the intervention. NURSING IMPLICATIONS: Nurses should screen for fatigue prior to initial chemotherapy and periodically, continue to screen for poor sleep in patients reporting fatigue of 4 or greater (on a 0-10 scale), and use evidence-based guidelines to select use appropriate interventions.",0,0,

To guide intervention efforts, this study examined predictors of participant-reported physician recommendation for HPV vaccination in young US adults. METHODS: Females and males (N=223) aged 18-26 years were recruited online through Craigslist, a popular classified advertising website. Ads ran from September 2013 to March 2014 in the 25 largest US cities. Participants completed a survey that evaluated demographic and sociopolitical characteristics, sexual history, HPV vaccination history, and whether they had ever received a recommendation for HPV vaccination from a doctor or healthcare provider. RESULTS: 53% reported receiving a referral for HPV vaccination and 45% had received >/= 1 dose of HPV vaccination. Participants who received a referral were over 35 times more likely to receive >/= 1 dose of HPV vaccine than participants without a referral. Bivariable and multivariable correlates of provider recommendation were identified. The results of the multivariable model indicated that younger (aged 18-21 years), female, white participants with health insurance (i.e., employer or other type, such as . CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the recommendations of the Physicians for HPV vaccination vary based on patient characteristics.The results underscore the key role of the healthcare provider in advancing HPV vaccination and have important implications for future HPV vaccine interventions in young adults.",0,0,
1421,Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015: Elaboration and Explanation,"Logs of systematic reviews and meta-analyses enable planning and documentation of review methods, protect against arbitrary decision-making during review conduct, allow readers to assess the existence of selective reporting based on completed reviews, and, when made publicly available, reduce duplication and possibly encourage collaboration. Evidence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar issues is mounting, and calls have been made for support of documentation and public availability of review logs. Several efforts have been made in recent years to address these issues, including the development of an international registry of prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and the launch of the first open-access journal dedicated solely to the publication of systematic review products, including Protocols, dedicated (Systematic Reviews by BioMed Central). . To further this effort and building on the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses), an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness and frequency of documented systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols – PRISMA -P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered essential and minimal components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol, full understanding and evidence of the necessity of each item, and a prime example from an existing published protocol. This paper should be read in conjunction with the PRISMA-P 2015 Statement. Authors and reviewers of systematic reviews are strongly encouraged to use PRISMA-P when creating and evaluating review protocols.",0,0,
1422,Prescribing habits of general practitioners when selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen for lower respiratory tract infections in adults in Sicily,"The survey was conducted between September 1995 and May 1996 to describe the prescribing behavior among Sicilian General Practitioners (GPs) when choosing an empiric antibiotic regimen for LRTIs in adult patients and to initiate an educational process involving the same GPs in decisions regarding their prescribing and in enforcing local policies. Each doctor filled out a questionnaire for each therapeutic intervention, which ended with a prescription of antibiotics. The questionnaire also asked about the patient's characteristics, the diseases to be treated and the prescription of medication. Physicians were asked to provide an opinion on the infectious disease severity rating prior to selecting antibiotic treatment, in order to evaluate physicians' prescribing behavior in relation to the patient's symptoms. Of all the Sicilian GPs contacted, 76 doctors from 25 Sicilian cities with a patient population of 96,630 agreed to participate. The GPs used 49 different molecules and six different combinations of two antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics were cephalosporins (55.0%). Penicillins (11.7%), fluoroquinolones (11.4%), macrolides (10.1%), and combinations of penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors (7.9%) together accounted for 41.1% of the remaining antibiotic prescriptions out of. The choice of route of administration was significantly influenced by the patient's age, symptoms and signs of the disease, and the presence of comorbidities rather than bacteria suspected of causing the disease. The rather marked variation in antibiotic prescribing pattern for LRTIs among Sicilian GPs reflects the lack of availability or knowledge of local or national guidelines for treating these diseases.",0,0,
1423,Prescription data as an aid in the pharmacotherapy audit (I). General Considerations,"This article discusses how prescription data provided by pharmacies can be used as a tool to support the improvement of prescribing behavior. For the optimal use of prescription data in the pharmacotherapeutic audit, the specific objective of the audit meeting must be clear. Next, appropriate measures (quality of drug selection, volume, cost) for presentation and discussion of the prescription must be selected. For some of the objectives of the audit meetings, suggestions for appropriate measures are made. For each stage of behavior change, the article describes why and how prescribing data can make a useful contribution. Finally, recommendations are given on the prerequisites for the optimal use of recipe data. Important factors are that the prescription data should adequately cover the physicians' patient population, information is needed on the extent of repeat prescriptions and the prescription of drugs with multiple indications can cause difficulties in the interpretation of the graphs. With this information in mind, prescribing feedback can be tailored to the needs of the study groups and targeted to the intended intervention.",0,0,
1424,Prescribing of non-occupational HIV prophylaxis after exposure by emergency physicians: An analysis of prescribing accuracy and compliance,"We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a prospective nPEP (non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis) registry based on patient consultations in an academic emergency department in Brussels, Belgium. Here we review 1,357 consultation cases from January 2011 to December 2013. The aim of the study is to determine whether emergency physicians prescribe nPEP according to national guidelines with the support of IDS (infectious disease specialists). Since this procedure is associated with high costs, we wanted to verify the correct assignment of treatment to high-risk patients. In addition, we wanted to determine whether adherence to nPEP when prescribed by an emergency physician differs from literature reports. Finally, we wanted to describe the population counseling for nPEP in our center. EMS physicians were more likely to prescribe nPEP for high-risk exposures (98.6%) compared to moderate-risk exposures (53.2%)"";"" appropriate allocation of resources from a public health perspective. The adequacy of the prescription when assessed according to the Belgian nPEP guidelines was 98.8%. Adherence to nPEP prescribed by emergency physicians was 60% in our study. Compliance was highest among MSM (men who have sex with men), while victims of sexual assault showed the lowest compliance. Overall, this study suggests that emergency physicians can safely and appropriately prescribe nPEP when supported by comprehensive guidelines. Recognizing intrinsic differences within heterogeneous populations counseling for nPEP can improve compliance with this costly public health intervention.",0,0,
1425,Prescription omega-3 fatty acids: a review for caregivers,"Nurse practitioners (NPs) often take a multidisciplinary approach to treating and educating patients. Working with a registered dietitian is not uncommon when treating patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides [TGs] >/=500 mg/dL). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia should be managed and treated to normalize TG levels (TG levels < 150 mg/dL). Treatment for severe hypertriglyceridemia is often threefold, including lifestyle modifications, diet modification, and pharmacotherapy. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are generally the first step in lowering TG levels. Registered Dietitians promote a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. There is growing evidence supporting the consumption of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid to lower TGs. When lifestyle and dietary changes do not effectively lower TGs, the NPs recommend pharmacological therapy as the next step. A viable pharmacological option includes prescription omega-3 (P-OM3) fatty acid ethyl esters. Each 4 g/day dose of P-OM3 provides 465 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg docosahexaenoic acid. Clinical studies show that P-OM3 can safely and effectively lower TGs by 45% in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Nurses play an important role in managing severe hypertriglyceridemia and educating patients about lifestyle and dietary changes that can have a profound impact on patient health.",0,0,

1428,Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women with cervical swab,"OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in patients with normal and abnormal cervical swabs. DESIGN A prospective study of asymptomatic women with normal cervical swabs visiting their general practitioner and newly referred patients with abnormal swabs visiting a colposcopy clinic. SETTING A colposcopy clinic and urban general practice (list size 5500) in north west Glasgow. PARTICIPANTS 197 asymptomatic women visited their general practitioner for cervical swab testing and 101 randomly selected patients visited the colposcopy clinic for abnormal swab testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of various sexually transmitted infections as determined by culture and serological testing. RESULTS Of the 101 women with cytologic abnormalities, six had current chlamydial infection demonstrated by culture and none had gonococcal infection"";"" Of the 197 women with normal swabs, 24 (12%) had chlamydial infection and two had gonorrhea. Serological studies of Chlamydia trachomatis-specific antibodies also showed that a large proportion of patients in both groups were exposed to this agent. There was no significant difference between the groups in the prevalence of any sexually transmitted disease examined. CONCLUSION There is a high prevalence of chlamydial infection in women in north-west Glasgow, regardless of their cervical cytologic status.",0,0,
1429,Prevalence of nonpolypoid (flat and depressed) colorectal neoplasms in asymptomatic and symptomatic adults,"Context Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Prevention has focused on the detection and removal of polypoid neoplasms. Data on the significance of nonpolyposis colorectal neoplasms (NP-CRNs) are limited. Objectives To determine the prevalence of NP-CRNs in a veteran hospital population and to characterize their association with colorectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients Cross-sectional study at a California Veterans Hospital of 1819 patients who underwent elective colonoscopy from July 2003 to June 2004. Results The overall prevalence of NP-CRNs was 9.35% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.05%-10.78%; n=170). The prevalence of NP-CRNs in the subpopulations for screening, surveillance, and symptoms was 5.84% (95% CI, 4.13%-8.00%; n=36), 15.44% (95% CI, 12 .76%-18.44%; n=101) and 6.01% (95% CI, 4.17%-8.34%; n=33).The overall prevalence of NP-CRNs with in situ or submucosal invasive carcinoma was 0.82% (95% CI, 0.46%-1.36%; n=15), in the screening population the prevalence was 0.32% (95% CI, 0.04% -1.17%;n=2). Overall, NP-CRNs were more likely to contain carcinomas (odds ratio, 9.78; 95% CI, 3.93-24.4) than polypoid lesions, regardless of size. The positive size-adjusted association of NP-CRNs with in situ or submucosal invasive carcinomas was demonstrated also observed in subpopulations for screening (odds ratio 2.01; 95% CI 0.27-15.3) and surveillance (odds ratio 63.7; 95%). CI, 9.41-431). The depressed type had the highest risk (33%). Nonpolypoid colorectal neoplasms containing carcinoma were smaller in diameter compared to the polypoid ones (mean [SD] diameter, 15.9 [10.2] mm vs. 19.2 [9.6] mm). The procedure times have not changed significantly compared to historical controls. Conclusion In this group of experienced patients, NP-CRNs were relatively common lesions diagnosed during routine colonoscopy and had a greater association with carcinoma compared to polypoid neoplasms, regardless of size.",0,0,
1430,"Prevalence of war-related mental illness and association with displacement status in post-war Jaffna District, Sri Lanka","Context Almost 2.7 million people worldwide are internally displaced (they seek refuge in safe areas of their own countries) each year by armed conflict. Although the psychological effects of war are well documented, less is known about the psychological symptoms of forced displacement among internally displaced people. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of the most common war-related mental illnesses, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, anxiety and depression and to assess the association between displacement status and these disorders in post-war Jaffna District, Sri Lanka. Design, setting and participants Between July and September 2009, a multi-stage cross-sectional cluster sample survey was conducted among 1517 households in Jaffna district, including two IDP camps. The response rate was 92% (1448 respondents, 1409 eligible respondents). Two percent of participants (n=80) were currently displaced, 29.5% (n=539) were recently relocated, and 68.5% (n=790) were long-term residents. Bivariable analyses, followed by multivariable logistic regression models, were performed to determine the association between displacement status and mental health. Main Outcome Parameters Symptom criteria for PTSD, anxiety and depression as measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist C25. Results The overall prevalence of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety and depression was 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1% - 9.7%), 32.6% (95% CI, 28.5% - 36 .9%) and 22.2% (95% CI, 18.2%–26.5%). Currently displaced participants were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD (odds ratio [OR], 2.71"", 95% CI, 1.28-5.73), anxiety (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.89- 4.48) and depression (OR, 4.55; 95% CI, 2.47-8.39) compared to long-term residents. Recently resettled residents were more likely to report symptoms of PTSD (OR, 1.96; 95% KI, 1.11-3.47) compared to long-term residents. However, displacement was no longer associated with mental health symptoms after controlling for trauma exposure. Conclusion Among residents of Jaffna district of Sri Lanka, the prevalence of symptoms of war-related mental illness was significant and significantly associated with displacement status and underlying trauma burden.",0,0,
1431,Preventing and dealing with unprofessionalism in medical schools,"Professionalism is a required competency for medical students, residents, practicing physicians, and academic faculty. Faculty members must adhere to codes of conduct or risk disciplines. The authors describe problems of unprofessionalism, culminating in allegations of scientific misconduct or the filing of complaints in academic medicine, and outline strategies for early intervention and prevention. The authors, vice and associate deans and executive directors of the office of faculty affairs at a major US medical school, have dealt with many allegations of unprofessional conduct over the past decade. They present case studies based on behaviors such as disrespect, inappropriate language and behavior, lack of cooperation with healthcare team members, and sexual harassment/discrimination. They discuss factors that make evaluating these behaviors difficult, including variable definitions of respect, different cultural norms, and false accusations. The authors provide recommendations for prevention and intervention, including early detection, performance management, sexual harassment education and referrals to professional coaches, anger management classes, and teacher support programs.",0,0,
1432,Caries prevention in young children of Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York: Maternal and pediatrician perspectives,"OBJECTIVE: Childhood caries is common in South Asian immigrant families. Few children visit a dentist by the age of 12 months as recommended by current guidelines. The pediatric visit has important potential to connect children to preventative care. The aim of this study was to understand the barriers and promoters of caries prevention for young children of Bangladeshi immigrant families in New York. Qualitative data were collected as a preliminary step in developing an oral health counseling intervention for South Asian children. BASIC DESIGN: Qualitative interviews on child nutrition and oral health prevention were conducted with mothers from Bangladesh. Qualitative interviews were conducted with paediatricians on their experiences with care. The data were analyzed using standard qualitative approaches. SETTING: Pediatric practices for low-income Bangladeshi immigrants in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 26 mothers of children aged 6-24 months receiving services in five pediatric facilities and 15 pediatricians serving these facilities. RESULTS: Both mothers and their pediatricians described risky feeding practices, communication problems, and lack of compliance. The oral health of young children has been a low priority for some mothers. However, most were concerned about childhood tooth decay but lacked the skills or resources to reduce the risk of tooth decay. CONCLUSIONS: The results support our plan to develop an empowerment-based counseling intervention to address the risk of caries in children. Pediatric dentists should be aware of the barriers to caries prevention in this group.",0,0,
1433,Preventing Child Abuse and Neglect with a Nursing Home Visitation Program: The Disabling Effects of Domestic Violence,"Context Home visits to families with young children have been promoted as an effective means of preventing child abuse, but few studies have examined the conditions under which such programs achieve this goal. Aim To investigate whether the presence of domestic violence limits the impact of nursing home visits on reducing reasonable reports of child abuse and neglect. Design Fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized trial. A semi-rural community in upstate New York. Participants Of 400 socially disadvantaged pregnant women with no previous live births who were consecutively admitted between April 1978 and September 1980, 324 mothers and their children participated in the follow-up study. Interventions Families were randomized to receive routine perinatal care (control group; n = 184 attended follow-up), routine care plus home visits by nurses during pregnancy (n = 100), or routine care plus home visits by nurses during pregnancy assigned and until the child's second birthday (n = 116). Key Outcome Measures Number of substantiated reports over the entire 15-year period involving the study child as a subject regardless of the offender's identity or the mother as an offender regardless of the child's identity extracted from state records and analyzed by treatment group and extent of domestication Domestic violence as measured by the Conflict Tactics Scale. Results Families who received home visits during pregnancy and infancy had significantly fewer reports of child abuse involving the mother as the perpetrator (p=0.01) or the study child as the subject (p=0.04) than families who did not receive home visits. The number of reports of abuse in mothers who received home visits only during pregnancy did not differ from the control group. For mothers who received visits up to the child's second birthday, the treatment effect decreased with increasing levels of domestic violence. Of those women who reported 28 or fewer incidents of domestic violence (79% of the sample), home-visiting mothers had significantly fewer incidents of child abuse over the 15-year period than mothers who did not receive longer-term intervention (p=0.01). However, this intervention did not significantly reduce child abuse among mothers who reported more than 28 incidents of domestic violence (21% of the sample). Conclusions The presence of domestic violence can limit the effectiveness of interventions in reducing incidents of child abuse and neglect.",0,0,
1434,Prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke with aggressive statin therapy in older adults using a team management model,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to highlight recent results from clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of statin therapy in adults aged 65 years and older and to examine how Nurses Practitioners (NPs) and Doctor Assistants (PAs) work with physicians as collaborators team to better address the needs of this fastest-growing subset of the US population, which is at high risk for cardiovascular events, including stroke. DATA SOURCES: This report was compiled by reviewing the scientific literature on the safety and efficacy of statin therapy, including impact on cardiovascular, coronary, and stroke endpoints, with particular reference to clinical trial results in elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Recent guidelines emphasize that age alone is not a reason to discontinue statin treatment in older adults. Despite the evidence highlighted in this review showing that older patients can safely benefit from statin therapy, studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between age and treatment propensity. Older patients often have multiple risk factors and many chronic comorbidities that appear to complicate and hinder treatment in many busy clinical practices. More comprehensive guidelines for statin use in older patients, including recommendations for treatment goals and developing a framework for statin use in stroke prevention, would assist healthcare providers in treating this high-risk population. Finally, NPs and PAs are both well trained and well positioned to treat patients with chronic stable cardiovascular disease (CVD). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Implementing a multidisciplinary team approach to identifying those at risk and providing them with education, counseling and effective statin treatment will support efforts to reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality in older adults.",0,0,
1435,Prevention of depression in at-risk youth: a randomized controlled trial,"Initial situation Adolescent offspring of depressed parents have a significantly increased risk of developing depressive disorders. Although some smaller targeted prevention studies have found that the risk of depression can be reduced, these findings have yet to be replicated and extended to large at-risk populations in different settings. Aim To determine the impact of a group cognitive-behavioral (CB) prevention program compared to usual care in preventing onset of depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multicenter, randomized, controlled study conducted in 4 US cities, enrolled 316 adolescent (aged 13-17 years) offspring of parents with current or previous major depressive disorders from August 2003 to February 2006 were recruited. Adolescents had a history of depression, current elevated but sub-diagnostic depressive symptoms, or both. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after the 8-week intervention, and after the 6-month extension period. Intervention Adolescents were randomly assigned to the CB prevention program, which consisted of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions, or were assigned to usual care alone. Main outcome measures Rate and hazard ratio (HR) of a probable or definite depressive episode (i.e. depressive symptom score of ≥ 4) for at least 2 weeks, as diagnosed by clinical interviewers. Results During follow-up after the continuation session, the rate and heart rate of depressive episodes were lower in participants in the CB prevention program than in those in usual care (21.4% vs. 32.7%; HR 0.63; 95% confidence interval [ CI ], 0.40–0.98) Adolescents in the CB prevention program also showed significantly greater improvement in self-reported depressive symptoms than those in usual care (coefficient, ?1.1; z = ?2.2; P = 0 ,03). Baseline moderated intervention effects (HR, 5.98; 95% CI, 2.29-15.58; P=0.001) In adolescents whose parents were not depressed at baseline, the CB prevention program was more effective in preventing onset of depression than the usual treatment (11.7% vs. 40.5%; HR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.11-0.50) during the CB prevention program in adolescents with a currently depressed parent was no more effective than usual treatment in preventing depression (31.2% vs. 24.3%; HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.76-2.67). Conclusion The CB prevention program had a significant preventive effect based on both clinical diagnoses and self-reported depressive symptoms during the 9-month follow-up period, but this effect was not evident in adolescents with a currently depressed parent.",0,0,
1436,Fall prevention among older adults in shared accommodation: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement,"DESCRIPTION: Update to the 1996 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation Statement on Advice on the Prevention of Home and Leisure Injuries, Including Falls. METHODS: The USPSTF reviewed emerging evidence on the effectiveness and harms of primary care interventions for fall prevention among older adults living in communities. Interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactorial clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home hazard modification, and exercise or physical therapy. RECOMMENDATIONS: The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in ambulatory adults aged 65 years and older who are at increased risk of falls. (Grade B Recommendation) The USPSTF does not recommend automatically conducting an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and older because the likelihood of benefit is low. In deciding whether this service is appropriate in an individual case, patients and clinicians should weigh the benefits and harms based on the circumstances of previous falls, comorbid conditions, and the patient's values.

1437,Preventive Care Advised (PCA)/ Operative Care Advised (OCA) - Categorization of caries by management option,"number of systems and classifications are currently used by clinicians, epidemiologists and clinical researchers to classify carious lesions into various grades. These systems are based on the depth of the lesion and/or the presence/absence of macroscopic cavitation. In order to improve the validity and comparability of such systems in the face of increasing knowledge about disease course, lesion behavior and caries management options, the authors propose a new categorization system that distinguishes between lesions that usually require surgical intervention and those that do not require surgical intervention. In the future, it is proposed that diagnostic systems, in addition to the existing conventional criteria, also include the reporting of results in the form of 1) lesions for which appropriate non-invasive preventive treatment is recommended (PCA lesions) and 2) lesions for which surgery is performed should allow caution (OCA lesions). For certain specific applications, locally acceptable subdivisions may need to be developed and agreed. The adoption of this additional nomenclature and approach in the future should support communication between the different groups involved in caries diagnosis and research. It can facilitate the dissemination of research results and help ""drive"" researchers working on caries diagnostic methods to focus on techniques that help in the accurate assessment of lesion activity and behavior. Such a focus should also improve our understanding of treatment decisions and encourage the development of clinical guidelines. The possibility to keep existing criteria in parallel for local and other purposes would preserve comparability with previously collected data.",0,0,
1438,Preventive Evidence into Practice (PEP) Study: Implementation of Guidelines for the Prevention of Primary Vascular Diseases in the General Practice Protocol for a Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: There are significant gaps in the implementation and uptake of evidence-based guideline recommendations for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in Australian general practice. This study protocol describes the methodology for a cluster-randomized study to assess the effectiveness of a model designed to improve implementation of these guidelines in Australian general practice, developed by a collaboration between researchers, NGOs and the profession. METHODS: We anticipate that the intervention will change physician and patient behavior, resulting in improved assessment of lifestyle and physiological risk factors (by 20%) and increased adherence to guideline recommendations for: the management of cardiovascular and diabetic Risk factors (by 20%)"" and lifestyle and physiological risk factors of at-risk patients (by 5%). Thirty-two primary care practices will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either receive the intervention or continue usual care, after stratification by state. The Intervention is delivered through: small group instruction; review of patient records to determine preventive treatment;"" and practice facilitation visits adapted to the needs of practices. Outcome data is extracted from electronic medical records and patient questionnaires, and a qualitative assessment from provider and patient interviews is performed. DISCUSSION: We plan to disseminate the study results widely and directly inform implementation strategies of governments, professional associations and non-governmental organisations, including partner organisations.",0,0,
1439,Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis,"BACKGROUND: Postnatal psychosis is a life-threatening condition worldwide, affecting one to two in 1000 new mothers. It has an abrupt onset within a month of birth. Affected young mothers quickly develop overt psychosis, cognitive impairment, and disorganized behaviors. Factors that increase the risk of postnatal psychosis include being a single mother, elderly women, or women with a psychiatric history and family history of mood disorder, prenatal depression, and autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. The risk of future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%. Preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis aim to identify women with risk factors, to detect an impending psychosis early through screening, and to carry out preventive drug therapy. Mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hormonal therapy may be helpful in preventing postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk. OBJECTIVES: To examine the best available evidence for interventions to prevent postnatal psychosis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2012 using the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group search strategy. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors checked all citations to ensure reliable selection. When we included relevant studies, we planned to assess the methodological quality of the identified studies using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors independently extracted data. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and number required to show benefit/harm of treatment (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention-to-treat basis . MAIN RESULTS: There were no included studies in this review. The electronic search yielded three relevant references, among which we identified two old planned studies that appeared never to have started and one that we excluded as a study because it was a case series report. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions. Despite the growing interest in women's mental health, the literature in the field of postnatal psychosis is still very limited. It appears that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practice, which is guided solely by differing clinical judgements. Women at risk of postnatal psychosis and their families are entitled to be disappointed in the medical/research community. A post hoc PubMed topic search (not method specific) identified mainly case series. Policy makers have no trial-based evidence to base their policies on. Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-documented randomized trials. Available publications suggest that such studies are possible, and research funders may wish to make this work a priority.",0,0,
1440,Adherence to guidelines for the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain by primary care physicians: results of the study on the effectiveness of a collaborative pain approach,"OBJECTIVE: We assessed the standard of care provided by the primary care physician as documented in patients' medical records, predictors of documented standard of care, and their association with pain-related functioning. The patients were participants in a randomized study of the cooperative treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. The intervention included patient and primary care physician education, symptom monitoring, and intervention team feedback to physicians. METHODS: To assess compliance with the evidence-based treatment guidelines on which our intervention was based, we developed an 8-point chart review tool, the Pain Process Checklist (PPC). We then reviewed the electronic medical records of 365 long-term patients treated by 42 general practitioners over a 12-month period. Intervention status, demographic, and clinical variables were tested as predictors of PPC scores using generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE was also used to test whether PPC scores predicted treatment response (>/=30% decrease in Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire score). RESULTS: The rates of documented guideline-compliant care varied widely between the PPC items, from 94% of patients with pain to 17% of patients on opioids with addressed adverse events. Intervention status was unrelated to item scores, and PPC-7 total scores were not significantly different between intervention and treat-as-usual patients (61.2%, standard error [SE] = 3.3% vs 55.2%, SE = 2.6%, P = 0.15 ). In a multivariate model, higher PPC-7 scores were associated with opioid prescription (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07, P = 0.007) and lower PPC-7 scores with patient age (10-year difference OR = 0.97, P = 0.004). Finally, intervention patients who received quantitative pain and depression assessments were less likely to respond to treatment (assessed vs. not: 18% vs. 33%, P=0.008 and 13% vs. 28%, P=0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As measured by medical record review, additional training and clinical feedback did not result in improved delivery of documented, guideline-compliant pain care, and adherence to guidelines by primary care physicians did not improve clinical outcomes for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.",0,0,
1441,Experiences of primary care physicians prescribing HIV preexposure prophylaxis at a specialty community health center in Boston: lessons from first-time users,"INTRODUCTION: An estimated 1.2 million Americans have indications for the use of preexposure antiretroviral prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. For many of these at-risk individuals, the best opportunity to learn about and receive PrEP is during routine visits to their general practitioners. However, few general practitioners have prescribed PrEP, mainly due to practical concerns about the provision of PrEP in primary care. The experiences of specialist primary care physicians who have prescribed PrEP may shed light on the feasibility of general practitioner provision of PrEP. METHODS: From January to February 2015, 35 primary care physicians at a Boston community health center specializing in the care of sexual and gender minorities completed anonymous surveys regarding their experiences and practices with the provision of PrEP. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-two physicians (response rate = 91%) completed the surveys. Almost all physicians (97%) had prescribed PrEP (median 20 patients, interquartile range 11-33). Most clinicians reported risk reduction testing and counseling practices that follow US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for PrEP. Clinicians noted that drug toxicity was uncommon in patients using PrEP and adherence was generally reported to be high. However, the practices of some clinicians deviated from guideline recommendations, and some clinicians observed patients with increased risk behaviors. Most clinicians (79%) rated PrEP care as easy to achieve, and 97% thought they were likely to prescribe PrEP in the future. CONCLUSIONS: At a primary care hospital with specialized expertise in HIV prevention, clinicians felt that PrEP administration was safe, feasible, and potentially effective for a large number of patients. Efforts to involve general practitioners in PrEP care could facilitate the scale-up of this effective intervention.",0,0,
1442,Primary care guidelines on counseling practices: The effectiveness of computer-based versus paper-based versions. A cluster-randomized controlled trial among newly qualified general practitioners.,"Aim: To compare the impact of computer-based and paper-based versions of guidelines on the office practice of newly qualified physicians. METHODS: Two-arm, randomized, controlled study. Physicians were randomized to receive computerized or textbook-based versions of the same guidelines for a 4-week study period. Physician compliance with guideline recommendations on laboratory, radiological, physical and other examinations, procedures, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, physical therapy, and referrals was measured by reviewing case notes. Results: The study involved 139 recently qualified physicians working in 96 primary health care centers in Finland. Data on 4,633 patient contacts were abstracted, of which 3,484 were suitable for further analysis. Physician compliance with guidelines was high (over 80% using laboratory, radiology, physical exams and referrals). There were no significant differences in the physicians' counseling practices on any of the measured outcomes between the computer and textbook groups. Conclusion: Guidelines are a useful source of information for newly qualified physicians working in primary care. However, how the guidance is presented (electronically or on paper) does not affect the use of the guidance or its impact on decisions. Other factors should be considered when choosing the method of presenting guidelines, such as: B. Time to search for information, ease of use during the consultation, ability to be updated, cost of production and the doctor's own preferences.",1,1,
1443,Response of general practitioners to the dissemination of practice guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Much effort has been expended to produce guidelines for clinical practice, but relatively few studies address dissemination issues. If no guidelines are used, little is gained. This study evaluates the effect of three methods of disseminating asthma guidelines on physician behavior and attitudes towards educational strategies. METHODS: Asthma guidelines were mailed to 60 physicians at three Area Health Education Centers in Arkansas. One-site dissemination efforts included a brief synopsis, phone calls from physicians with ""details,"" and a medical education conference. Computer strategies were used at the second site and a multi-media approach was used at the third site with faxes, posters, videocassettes, audiocassettes and a medical education conference. A fourth location with 22 participants served as a comparison. Data were collected through mailed questionnaires, outpatient medical records, and physician interviews. Changes between baseline and posttest assessments after a 4-month intervention were calculated for medication intake and peak flow monitoring was compared to the control group (general linear model). Regression analyzes were used to identify physician and practice factors associated with specific training techniques. RESULTS: Each site improved with use of medication or peak flow monitoring, but none improved in all areas. The multimedia, continuous-recall approach was well accepted, but there was little support for the computational strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts to disseminate clinical guidelines should include a variety of formats, with an emphasis on short, concise summaries and frequent reminders. Social influence seems to play a role and will be a fertile area for further research.",0,1,
1444,Use of lumbar spine imaging tests by general practitioners: impact of guidelines and feedback on practice patterns,"OBJECTIVE: To reduce variability in primary care physician use of lumbar spine imaging techniques. DESIGN: Controlled intervention using clinical practice guidelines and feedback on practice patterns. STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty-seven internists and 28 general practitioners in a large group model HMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians in the intervention group received the clinical practice guideline for low back pain, followed by three bimonthly feedback reports on their current usage rates of lumbar spine radiographs and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. Physicians in the control group received neither the guideline nor the feedback reports. Automated radiology usage data was used to compare changes in usage rates and variability in usage rates among intervention- and control-group physicians over the study period. Neither guideline alone nor guideline plus feedback was associated with a significant decrease in usage rates or variability in usage rates for the lumbar spine imaging modalities studied. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice guidelines and practice pattern feedback fail to achieve their goals if characteristics of the practice environment and patient expectations and behaviors are not identified and considered.",0,0,
1445,GP recruitment is associated with smoking cessation counseling and referral,"OBJECTIVE: Most primary care providers (PCPs) support the importance of smoking cessation, but rates of counseling are low. We assessed the consistency of PCP's attitudes towards smoking cessation counseling and corresponding smoking cessation behaviors. DESIGN: This was a post-interventional analysis of a population-based sample from a randomized controlled group study of improving adherence to smoking cessation guidelines. SETTING: A total of 18 VA locations in the Southwest and Western United States participated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 primary care physicians completed a survey 12 months after implementing a quality improvement (QI) program for smoking cessation. Their patients also completed 12 (n=1080) and 18 months (n=924) follow-up surveys. INTERVENTION: The quality improvement intervention included setting local priorities, developing, implementing and monitoring quality improvement plans. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: GPs at intervention sites were more likely to report having counseled patients on smoking cessation (P=0.04), but no referral. PCP attitudes to smoking cessation counseling were strongly associated with reported counseling (P<0.001) and with referral (P=0.01). Other associations with counseling were the perceived barrier ""patients are not interested in quitting"" (P=0.01) and fewer years in practice (P=0.03)""; other associations with referral were specialist consultation (P<0.0001) and the perceived barrier of “not convenient referral” (P=0.001) (negative association). PCP attitudes were associated with higher rates of counseling, referral, and program participation. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs had attitudes consistent with their reported smoking cessation behaviors regardless of intervention participation, and more positive attitudes were associated with higher rates of patient-reported smoking cessation behaviors. The results suggest that primary care physicians who advocate smoking cessation counseling and referral may provide more treatment recommendations and have higher rates of smoking cessation.",0,1,
1446,Smoking cessation interventions by primary care physicians and smoking cessation among participants in the National Lung Screening Trial,"IMPORTANT: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) found a reduction in lung cancer mortality in participants screened with low-dose computed tomography compared to chest radiography. In February 2015, Medicare announced its decision to cover annual lung screening for patients with a significant history of smoking. These guidelines encourage smoking cessation treatment as an adjunct to screening, but the incidence and effectiveness of clinically delivered smoking cessation interventions administered after lung screening is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the reported physician-provided 5As (ask, advise, assess, support [talk about quitting or recommend smoking cessation medication, or recommend counseling] and arrange follow-up) after lung screening and changes in smoking behavior. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A matched case-control study (cases were quitters and controls were continued smokers) of 3336 NLST participants who were smokers at enrollment examined the rates and patterns of participants' 5A administration after lung screening and reported on smoking cessation behavior. MAIN FINDINGS AND MEASURES: Prevalence of physician-delivered 5As and associated smoking cessation after lung screening. RESULTS: The delivery of the 5As 1 year after screening was as follows: ask, 77.2%; advise, 75.6%; rate, 63.4%; support, 56.4%; and arrange aftercare, 10.4%. and assessment was not significantly associated with quitting in multivariate models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, screening outcomes, nicotine dependence, and motivation to quit. 95% CI, 1.21-1.63), and organizing was associated with a 46% increase in the likelihood of quitting (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.19-1.79). Smoking GPs who participated in the NLST were associated with increased cessation rates; less intensive interventions (questioning, counseling, and rating) were not. However, rates of support and arranged follow-up were relatively low. Our results confirm the need and benefit of physicians to take more active intervention steps to help patients undergoing screening to quit smoking.",0,0,
1447,The responsiveness of general practitioners to unhealthy behavior in adolescent patients,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physician responsiveness to unhealthy behaviors reported by adolescent patients during a comprehensive visit to clinical screening services. DESIGN: Non-probability sample of adolescent patients scheduled for routine physical examination. SETTING: Seven clinical sites in the Chicago, Illinois area. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen general practitioners and 95 adolescent patients between 11 and 18 years of age. INTERVENTION: Providers provided comprehensive clinical preventive services to adolescent patients using the model of adolescent preventive services guidelines. This model includes screening, counseling, a physical exam, and immunizations. Prior to the visit, the adolescent patients completed a screening questionnaire that included a 52-item health risk behavior profile. The responses to the screening questionnaire were discussed during the visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each provider's responsiveness to reported unhealthy behaviors was determined by comparing the adolescent patient's responses on the screening questionnaire to those reported during a debriefing session with the adolescent to determine whether specific topics were discussed. Responsiveness to highly sensitive behaviors was determined by comparing the screening questionnaire and medical record. RESULTS: On average, each adolescent patient reported 10 risk behaviors, 7 of which were discussed. The severity of the reported risky behavior, the number of reported biological health concerns, and the gender of the adolescent patient were significant predictors of provider responsiveness. The number of unhealthy behaviors reported, length of visit, physician's job role and gender, whether the adolescent was a new patient, and the age of the adolescent patient were unrelated to responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Providers responded to most unhealthy behaviors reported during a single visit, but responsiveness decreased when 3 or more biological health concerns or relatively serious problems were reported. Steps can be taken to increase vendor responsiveness.",0,0,

1449,"Primary care-based, multifaceted, interdisciplinary medical education intervention for patients with systolic heart failure: lessons from a cluster-randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Chronic (systolic) heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling condition. Adherence to evidence-based guidelines in primary care has been shown to improve health outcomes. The aim was to investigate the impact of a multidisciplinary training intervention for general practitioners (GPs) (Train the Trainer = TTT) on patient and performance outcomes. METHODS: This paper presents the key findings from the study and discusses the lessons learned during the conduct of the TTT study. General practitioner practices were randomly assigned to the TTT intervention or the control group. 37 general practitioners (18 TTT, 19 controls) were randomized and 168 patients with diagnosed CHF (91 TTT, 77 controls) were included. GPs in the intervention group participated in four meetings to provide clinical practice guidelines and feedback on pharmacotherapy. The primary endpoint was patient self-reported quality of life at seven months using the SF-36 physical functioning scale. Secondary endpoints included other SF-36 scales, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, prescription, major depressive disorder (PHQ-9), behavior change (European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale), patient -Perceived quality of care (EUROPEP) and heart failure improvement using NT-proBNP values. As the recruitment goals were not met, an exploratory analysis was performed. RESULTS: For many endpoints, there was high baseline power in both groups. At seven months, there was no significant mean difference between groups for the primary outcome measure (-3.3, 95% CI -9.7 to 3.1, p=0.30). The only difference in secondary outcomes related to primary care physician prescription of aldosterone antagonists in the intervention group, with significant differences between groups at follow-up (42 vs. 24%, adjusted OR = 4.0, 95% CI 1.2- 13"";"" p=0.02). CONCLUSION: The intervention did not change the primary endpoint or most of the secondary endpoints. Recruitment goals were not met, and under-recruitment of practices and patients, and selection bias among participating general practitioners preclude firm conclusions, but the CI indicates ineffectiveness of the intervention in this sample. We describe lessons learned from conducting the study for future planning and conduct of confirmatory studies in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN08601529.",0,0,
1450,Smoking interventions in primary care,"Primary care is an important venue for promoting smoking cessation. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing the effects of brief smoking interventions and comprehensive programs in a primary care setting provide excellent evidence that such interventions significantly increase patients' smoking cessation rates and that the effect increases with increasing dose of the intervention. Unfortunately, despite the widespread dissemination of guidelines for prevention services and the positive attitudes of physicians towards such services, the current level of delivery of smoking cessation interventions by physicians in real settings is not high, making this a major research and public health concern . Interventions to increase implementation rate Provider-delivered brief smoking interventions can be broadly classified into the following groups: provider education, clinical systems and procedures (e.g., patient screening and follow-up); and organizational policies (e.g., reimbursement, coverage, performance measurements). Given the significant impact that primary care interventions can have on smoking cessation, it is important to investigate methods to increase their delivery rate and impact. Examples of research questions to motivate intervention are: What are the best incentives or combinations of incentives for physicians? What are the most effective strategies for reminding vendors to intervene? How can these best be implemented in different types of environments and systems? How can a step care and patient treatment matching model be used? Examination of factors such as reimbursement policies and services covered does not lend itself well to tightly controlled randomized trials. Therefore, the use of quasi-experimental designs and the application of qualitative strategies are required. These designs present a different challenge for the research community.",0,0,
1451,Primary coronary intervention (PCI) within the heart attack network system in a German city (Essen),"In a large German city (Essen, 490,000 inhabitants), a new network system for patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was set up in 2004. This included a so-called integrated care model (IV model) with the participation of health insurance companies. In a cooperative structure between invasive and non-invasive hospitals, general practitioners and cardiologists as well as emergency services, it was possible to ensure that every patient with STEMI is treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as quickly as possible in accordance with the current guidelines. The patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity, medication) were comparable to other studies and registries. The primary success rate was high (96.4%). Acute in-hospital outcomes showed low mortality (7.6%). The delay times were comparable to other registers. The symptom-to-balloon time was 239 min, the medical contact-to-balloon time 95 min, the door-to-balloon time 60 min and the puncture-to-balloon time 18 min (median values). The STEMI network system in Essen demonstrates the possibility of modern therapy for patients with heart attacks (primary PCI) in a cooperative modality between all participants in the healthcare system.",0,0,
1452,Primary prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease with a cognitive behavioral program targeting lifestyle modifications in at-risk individuals: design of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The number of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is growing rapidly. A large part of this increase is due to lifestyle-related risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet. Changing these risk factors has the potential to delay or prevent the development of T2DM and CVD. It is hypothesized that a cognitive behavioral program (CBP) specifically focused on motivation and self-management in individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease and/or T2DM will improve their lifestyle behaviors and, as a result, reduce their risk of developing T2DM and CVD. METHODS: 12,000 residents aged 30 to 50 years living in several communities in the semi-rural region of West Friesland are invited by their general practitioner (n = 13) to measure their own waist circumference with a tape measure. Individuals with abdominal obesity (male waist >/= 102 cm, female waist >or= 88 cm) will be invited to participate in the second step of the screening, which includes blood pressure, a blood sample, and anthropometric measurements. T2DM and CVD risk scores are then calculated according to the ARIC and SCORE formulas, respectively. Individuals with a score indicating high risk of developing T2DM and/or CVD are then randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=300) or the control group (n=300). Participants in the intervention group follow a CBP goal in changing their diet, physical activity, and smoking behavior. Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST) are used as counseling methods, which are aimed in particular at intrinsic motivation for change and self-management of problems on the part of the participants. The CBP is administered by trained nurses in the participant's general practice and consists of a maximum of six individual 30-minute sessions, followed by 3-month refresher sessions via telephone. Control group participants receive booklets with health guidelines on physical activity and diet, and smoking cessation. The primary outcome measures are changes in T2DM and CVD risk scores. Secondary outcome measures are changes in lifestyle behavior and cost-effectiveness and value for money. All relevant direct and indirect costs are measured and followed up for 24 months. DISCUSSION: Behavior change is difficult, requiring time, significant effort, and motivation. The combination of the two counseling methods MI and PST, followed by refresher sessions, can lead to a lasting change in behavior.

1453,Preparing for hand hygiene compliance in clinical settings,"Introduction: Effective hand hygiene is the single most important measure to prevent nosocomial infections. Traditional information/education-based interventions have shown only modest benefits for compliance. This study aimed to investigate whether priming via olfactory and visual cues affects hand hygiene compliance. Method: Randomized controlled trial in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of a teaching hospital in Miami, Florida. The primary outcome data included observations – a mix of healthcare professionals and service users were observed entering the SICU by two trained observers and their hand hygiene compliance was independently verified. Interventions included either an olfactory primer (clean citrus smell) or a visual primer (male or female eyes). The primary endpoint was hand hygiene compliance (HHC) as measured by the visitor using the hand gel dispenser. Results: At the 5% level, there was significant evidence that a clean citrus smell significantly improved HHC (46.9% vs. 15.0%, p=0.0001). A significant improvement in HHC was observed when an image of “male eyes” was superimposed over the hand gel dispenser compared to the control group (33.3% vs. 15.0%, p<0.038). No significant improvement in HHC was observed when an image of female eyes was overlaid on the same hand gel dispenser (10.0% vs. 15.0%, p=0.626). Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to show that priming can affect HHC in a clinical setting. The results suggest that priming interventions could be used to change other behaviors relevant to public health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",1,1,
1454,Printed educational materials: Implications for professional practice and health care outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Printed educational materials (PEMs) are widely used passive dissemination strategies to improve knowledge, awareness, attitudes, skills, professional practice, and patient outcomes. Traditionally presented in paper formats such as monographs, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and clinical guidelines, they appear to be the most commonly used method of disseminating information. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of PEMs in improving process outcomes (including healthcare professional behavior) and patient outcomes. To investigate whether the impact of characteristics of PEMs (e.g., source, content, format, mode of delivery, timing/frequency, complexity of desired behavior change) can affect process outcomes (including healthcare professional behavior and patient outcomes). SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched up to July 2006: (a) The EPOC Group Specialized Register (including the database of studies to be assessed (see “Specialised Register” under “Group Details”)”; (b) The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness;"" (c) MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CAB Health. An updated search of MEDLINE was conducted in March 2007. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series analyzes (ITS) that assessed the impact of printed educational materials on healthcare professional practice and/or patient outcomes.There was no language restriction.Any objective measure of professional performance (e.g. number of tests ordered, prescriptions for a particular drug) or di e Health outcomes of the patient (e.g. B. blood pressure, number of caesarean sections) are included again. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four reviewers independently performed data abstraction using a modified version of the EPOC data collection checklist. Any disagreements were resolved through discussions between the assessors and arbitrators. The statistical analysis was based on considering dichotomous process outcomes, continuous process outcomes, dichotomous patient outcome measurements, and continuous patient outcome measurements. We have presented the results for all comparisons using a standard presentation method whenever possible. We reported separately for each study the median effect size for each outcome type and the median of these effect sizes across studies. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three studies were included in this review. Evidence from this review indicated that PEMs appear to have little positive impact on professional practice. RCTs comparing PEMs with no intervention observed a median absolute risk difference: +4.3% for categorical process outcomes (eg, x-ray requests, prescription, and smoking cessation activities) (range -8.0% to +9.6% , 6 studies) and a relative risk difference +13.6% for continuous process outcomes (eg, medication change, X-ray requests per practice) (range -5.0% to +26.6%, 4 studies). These results are similar to those reported for the ITS studies, although significantly larger effect sizes were observed (relative risk difference ranges from 0.07% to 31%). In contrast, the median effect size for categorical measures of patient outcome (eg, screening, return to work, smoking cessation) was -4.3% (range -0.4% to -4.6%, 3 studies)). Two studies reported worsening patient outcomes (eg, depression score, smoking cessation attempts) of -10.0% and -20.5%, respectively. A study comparing PEMs to educational workshops found minimal differences. Two studies comparing PEMs and educational work showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. It was not possible to investigate potential effect modifiers across studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review suggest that PEMs, when used alone, can have a positive effect on process outcomes compared to no intervention, but not on patient outcomes. Despite this wide range of effects reported for PEMs, the clinical significance of the observed effect sizes is unknown. There is insufficient information on how educational materials can be optimized. The effectiveness of educational materials compared to other interventions is uncertain.",0,1,
1455,Printed educational messages fail to increase the use of thiazides as first-line drugs for hypertension in primary care: a randomized controlled cluster study [ISRCTN72772651,"BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of printed educational messages in helping increase evidence-based clinical practice. Nonetheless, this news is flooding doctors' offices to promote treatments that can reduce costs while improving patient outcomes. This study evaluated the ability of printed educational messages to encourage the choice of thiazides as first-line treatment for people with newly diagnosed hypertension, a practice supported by good evidence and incorporated into guidelines that could reduce costs to the healthcare system. METHODS: The study used a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial (randomized by physician office group). DISCONTINUATION: The discontinuation affects all general/family doctor practices in Ontario. Bulletins recommending the use of thiazides as first-line treatment for hypertension were sent to each doctor, along with a well-read professional newsletter. Physicians were randomized to receive different versions of printed educational messages: an ""insert"" (two-page evidence-based article) and/or one of two different versions of an ""outsert"" (short, instructional message pinned to the outside of the newsletter). ). One outsert was developed with no explicit theory and one with messages that developed targeting factors from planned behavior theory or neither (newsletter only, no mention of thiazides). The percentage of patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed hypertension who were prescribed a thiazide as their only primary prescription. The effect of the intervention was estimated using a logistic regression model estimated using generalized estimating equation methods to account for the clustering of patients within physician offices. RESULTS: Four thousand five hundred four physicians (with 23,508 patients) were randomized, providing a power of 97%, to detect an absolute 5% increase in thiazide prescribing. No intervention effect was found. Thiazides were prescribed to 27.6% of patients visiting control physicians, 27.4% of patients with inserts, 26.8% of outsert patients, and 28.3% of patients visiting insert + outsert physicians, p=0 ,54. CONCLUSIONS: The study clearly failed to demonstrate any impact of printed educational messages on the increase in prescribing of thiazide diuretics for the first-line treatment of hypertension.

Psychiatric and psychiatric nursing practices have evaded the development of a unified medical-ethical standard for PRN drug administration. This paper reviews the evidence supporting PRN drug administration and proposes in the context of evidence-based best practices, current mental health guidelines, and professional ethics standard Australian PRN administration protocol. The procedures and circumstances leading to a nurse administering psychiatric drugs are broken down into five simple steps, namely (i) medical prescription; (ii) assessment of the patient's indications for intervention by the nursing staff; (iii) consideration of therapeutic options by nursing staff; (iv) obtaining the patient's consent;"" and (v) documenting the results of PRN administration. The literature associated with each step is presented together with national and international professional ethics, guidelines and documents on patients' rights in relation to the care of patients with mental disorders Conditions reviewed. Recommendations for best practice care are discussed at each step. There is a gap in published evidence supporting the use of PRN drugs in inpatient psychiatric inpatients. However, there is published evidence that PRN drugs increased co-morbidity Risks of morbidity and misuse may result in over-recommended dosages or polypharmacy, and complicate the assessment of the efficacy of regularly scheduled medications Alternative non-pharmacological treatment options to PRN medication are effective and associated with fewer side effects There are n.a an explicit national standard, operational criteria, or quality assurance for the use of PRN drugs in inpatient mental health facilities. Current PRN practices are largely unregulated and driven by essentially anecdotal evidence, leaving clinicians and the service vulnerable to claims of poor accountability and misuse (intentional and unintentional) of psychotropic drugs. The development of best practice guidelines for the use of PRN administration is essential.",0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of the effect of consensus guidelines agreed between GPs and specialists on GP behavior. SETTING: Southampton and South West Hampshire Health District, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 179 GPs working in 45 practices in the Borough of Southampton out of 254 eligible GPs, 107 in the control group and 78 in the study group. KEY MEASURES: Referral and screening rates and prescription costs for dyspepsia in the six months before and after the guidelines were introduced. RESULTS: Consensus guidelines were created with relative ease. After their introduction, referral rates for upper GI symptoms decreased significantly in both the study and control groups, but no significant changes occurred in either group in terms of the use of endoscopy or radiology, neither in terms of referral rates that patient selection or the test results. No difference in the number of items prescribed was observed between the control and study groups, but prescription costs increased by 25% in the study group (from £2,634 to £3,215 per GP) almost entirely due to an increased prescription rate of ulcer-remedies. CONCLUSION: The development of district guidelines for the management of dyspepsia in consensus between general practitioners and specialists was feasible. However, their acceptance and acceptability have varied, and their measured impact on some aspects of clinical behavior has been relatively weak and not necessarily associated with reduced costs or improved quality of care.",0,0,

RESULTS: Occupational health practitioners (n = 7) partially implemented the guideline at the environmental level, but performed well at the individual level. Behavior change counseling was provided “to a certain extent”. Employees (n=274) demonstrated high reach (86%), satisfaction (7.1), and attendance rates (4.4 out of 5 sessions). Significant effects on waist circumference (-1.5 cm to -2.1 cm) and body weight (-0.9 kg to -1.4 kg) were found in workers with higher attendance and satisfaction rates.

1465,Process assessment of complex interventions: Medical Research Council guidance,"Process evaluation is an essential part of designing and testing complex interventions. New MRC guidelines provide a framework for conducting and reporting process assessment studies Attempts to address problems such as smoking and obesity use increasingly complex interventions. These are commonly defined as interventions that involve multiple interacting components, although additional dimensions of complexity include the difficulty of their implementation and the number of organizational levels they target.1 Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for determining the effectiveness of interventions. Randomization is randomization possible. However, effect sizes do not provide policymakers with information about how an intervention might be replicated in its specific context or whether study results are reproduced. Previous MRC guidelines evaluating complex interventions focused on randomized trials and made no mention of process evaluation.2 Updated guidelines recognized the value of process evaluation within trials, stating that it can be used to assess the accuracy and quality of implementation, clarifying causal mechanisms and identifying contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes.â‚¬Â 3 However, it did not provide guidance on how to conduct the process evaluation. #### Summary In 2010, a workshop funded by the MRC Population Health Science Research Network discussed the need for guidance on process assessment.4 There was consensus that researchers, funders and...",0,0,
1466,"Procrastination, Deadlines und Performance: Self-Control by Precommitment","Procrastination is all too familiar to most people. People are delaying writing their research (that's what we're hearing!), repeatedly declaring that they'll start their diets tomorrow, or putting it off until next week to do odd jobs around the house. However, sometimes people try to control their procrastination by setting themselves deadlines. In this article, we ask three questions: (a) Are people willing to set themselves meaningful (ie, costly) deadlines to overcome procrastination? (b) Are self-imposed deadlines effective in improving task performance? (c) When people set deadlines for themselves, are they setting them optimally for maximum performance improvement? A number of studies have examined these questions experimentally and shown that the answer to the first two questions is yes and the third is no. People have self-control problems, they recognize them and try to control them by setting themselves costly deadlines. These deadlines help people control procrastination, but they're not as effective as some externally imposed deadlines in improving task performance.",0,0,
1467,Professional and lay social support for hysterectomy patients,"This article describes a study of social support for women undergoing hysterectomy and shows how initial research plans had to be altered when early interviews revealed the women's need for, and desire to receive, basic information from the researcher . The modified design allowed for comparisons between a group of women who received information as part of the research interview and a second group who received no such help. Hysterectomy follow-up at 3 months showed significant differences between the two groups, with the 'information group' being less hostile but more critical of their hospital treatment. The study also confirms previous findings by the same author of generally high levels of satisfaction, health, and return to activity after hysterectomy. Regarding social support, it is pointed out that full-time housewives are particularly dependent on support from carers due to their relative isolation from other sources of support and information. However, all respondents would have liked more information and support from medical professionals.

1468,Professional interventions for general practitioners to treat musculoskeletal disorders,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders require special management skills. Identifying interventions that equip general practitioners (GPs) with such necessary skills could lead to improved health outcomes for patients and reduced health care and societal costs. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of professional interventions for general practitioners aimed at improving the management of musculoskeletal disorders in primary care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), 2010, Issue 2""; MEDLINE, Ovid (1950 - October 2013); EMBASE, Ovid (1980 - October 2013); CINAHL, EbscoHost (1980 - November 2013) .) and the EPOC Specialized Register. We performed cited reference searches using ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar, and hand-searched selected editions of Arthritis and Rheumatism and Primary Care-Clinics in Office Practice. The last search was conducted in November 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA : We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time-series studies (ITS) of professional interventions for primary care physicians delivered in an outpatient setting aiming to improve the management (including diagnosis and treatment) of MSDs and to provide all objective measures of behavior in H Physician, patient, or economic outcomes report length, duration, intensity, and complexity compared to active or inactive controls. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently abstracted all data. We calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) of adhering to the desired practice for dichotomous outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes. We examined whether the direction of the intended behavior change influences the effectiveness of interventions. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria. Of 11 studies on osteoporosis, a meta-analysis of five studies (high-certainty evidence) showed that a combination of a GP alert system for a patient's increased risk of osteoporosis and a patient-directed intervention (including patient education and a reminder to see their GP ) improves the general practitioner's behavior regarding diagnostic tests of bone mineral density (BMD) and prescribing of osteoporosis drugs (RR 4.44; (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.54 to 5.55; 3 studies; 3386). participants)) for BMD and RR 1.71 (95% CI 1.50 to 1.94; 5 studies; 4,223 participants) for osteoporosis medications. The meta-analysis of two studies showed that alerting the general practitioner alone probably also increased the osteoporosis guideline-compliant behavior of the general practitioner (RR 4.75 (95% CI 3.62 to 6.24; 3,047 participants)) for BMD and RR 1.52 (95% CI 1.26 to 1.84; 3.047 participants) for osteoporosis medications) and that adding the patient-directed component is unlikely to result in a larger effect (RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.09 ; 2,995 participants)) for BMD and RR 0.93 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.10). ;“ 2,995 participants) for osteoporosis medication. Of the 10 studies on back pain, seven showed that the dissemination of guidelines and the provision of information for GPs can lead to little or no improvement in terms of guideline-compliant behavior by GPs. Two studies showed that the combination of guidelines and GP feedback on the total number of tests requested can affect GP behavior and lead to a slight reduction in the number of tests, while one of these studies showed that the combination of guidelines and GP r Radiology report reminders can result in a small but sustained reduction in the number of exam requests. Of the four studies on osteoarthritis, one study showed that the use of physicians with an educational influence can lead to an improvement in guideline-compliant behavior by general practitioners. Another study showed slight improvements in patient outcomes (pain control) after primary care physicians were trained in pain management. Of three shoulder pain studies, one reported that patient outcomes (functioning) may have improved little or not at all after general practitioner training in shoulder pain and injection training. Of two studies on other musculoskeletal disorders, one study on pain management showed that patient outcomes (pain control) may be worse after hands-on training in using validated rating scales. The 12 remaining studies on all musculoskeletal disorders showed little or no improvement in primary care physician behavior and patient outcomes. The direction of the desired behavior (ie, increasing or decreasing a behavior) does not appear to affect the effectiveness of an intervention. The majority of the studies did not examine the potential side effects of the interventions, and only three included a cost-benefit analysis. Overall, there were important methodological limitations in the evidence, with only a third of the studies reporting adequate attribution concealment and blinded outcome assessments. While our confidence in the pooled estimate of effects of interventions to improve diagnostic testing and prescription of medications in osteoporosis is high, our confidence in the reported estimates of effects in the remaining studies is low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is good-quality evidence that a GP alert system with or without patient-centred osteoporosis education improves guideline-compliant GP behavior, leading to better diagnosis and treatment rates. Interventions such as GP reminder messages and GP performance feedback combined with guideline dissemination may result in modest improvements in guideline-compliant behavior by GPs regarding back pain, while educating GPs on OA pain and employing pedagogically influential physicians lead to a slight improvement in patient outcomes or guideline-compliant behavior. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of such interventions in improving GP behavior and patient outcomes.",0,1,
1469,Prognostic Research Strategy (PROGRESS) 1: a framework for research into clinical outcomes,"Understanding and improving the prognosis of a disease or health condition is a priority in clinical research and practice. In this article, the authors present a framework of four interrelated themes in prognostic research, describe the importance of the first of these themes (understanding future outcomes in relation to current diagnostic and treatment practices), and present recommendations for the field of prognostic research in the clinical In medicine, the term prognosis refers to the risk of future health outcomes in people with a specific disease or health condition. Prognostic research is thus the study of relationships between future outcomes (endpoints) in people with a given baseline health status (starting point) to improve health (see supplemental figure at bmj.com). The study of prognosis has never been more important, as more people worldwide are living with one or more diseases or conditions that affect their health than ever before.1 As a result, governments around the world are becoming increasingly interested in health care outcomes for people with disease. 2 Similarly, research funders and researchers are increasingly focused on transferring new interventions and technologies from the laboratory to clinical practice and then into health policy to establish and implement new standards of quality care and improve patient outcomes to enhance. The results of prognostic research should therefore be an integral part of clinical decision-making, health policy and the discovery and evaluation of new approaches to patient management. However, there is a worrying gap between the potential and actual health implications of prognostic research. Prognostic research studies all too often fall far short of the high standards required in other areas such as therapeutic studies and genetic epidemiology. In the PROGnosis RESearch Strategy (PROGRESS) series (www.progress-partnership.org) we propose a framework of four distinct but interrelated forecasting research themes:",0,0,
1470,Promising developments in neuropsychological approaches to detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease: a selective review,"Recently published guidelines suggest that the best time to treat people with Alzheimer's disease is in the preclinical phase of the disease. This is a phase when individuals are defined as clinically normal but show signs of amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, and subtle cognitive/behavioural decline. While our standard cognitive tests are useful for detecting cognitive decline in the mild cognitive impairment stage, they were not designed to detect the subtle cognitive changes associated with this biomarker stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. However, neuropsychologists are attempting to address this challenge by designing newer cognitive measures and questionnaires derived from translational efforts in neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical/experimental neuropsychology. This review is a selective summary of several new, potentially promising approaches being explored for detecting early cognitive signs of preclinical Alzheimer's disease in presymptomatic individuals.",0,0,
1471,Promotion of evidence-based psychosocial care for cancer patients,"With numerous studies showing that mental health care reduces stress and improves quality of life, physicians have an obligation to treat cancer patients in a manner consistent with this evidence. Although the rationale is simple, there are major challenges in achieving the goal of translating research into clinical practice. One challenge has been the nature of the evidence, with many studies of psychosocial interventions characterized by poor methodological quality, a lack of eligibility criteria specifying increased burden, and minimal consideration of dissemination potential. A second challenge was to bring relevant evidence to the attention of practitioners. Targeted dissemination efforts, such as issuing clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based recommendations and distributing intervention materials over the Internet, appear to be more effective than passive efforts to provide physicians with useful information. Perhaps the most difficult aspect was persuading practitioners to change their practice. An approach currently under development would allow practitioners and healthcare organizations to conduct self-assessments of the quality of their mental health care based on medical record reviews. Feedback showing that the quality of care is not optimal is likely to inspire change, especially if the quality indicators assessed are considered important and reliable and point to concrete actions that can be taken. Using evidence to drive change in clinical practice is one of the key ways in which the field of psycho-oncology can realize its full potential to positively impact the lives of people living with cancer.",0,0,
1472,Promote hand hygiene compliance,"BACKGROUND: The German “Clean Hands Campaign” (an adaptation of the WHO Clean Care is Safer Care program) to promote hand hygiene among hospital staff at Hannover Medical School (MHH), known as Clean Hands Campaign (ASH ), had first Successes. However, by 2013, hygienic hand sanitiser compliance rates at the hospital's ten intensive care units (ICUs) and two hematopoietic stem cell transplant units (HSCTUs) had returned to baseline values (doctors: 48%; nurses: 56%). . The PSYGIENE cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether tailored interventions suggested by behavioral psychology research could produce more sustained improvements than ASH. Methods: The compliance model ""Health Action Process Approach"" (HAPA) specifies important psychological determinants of compliance. These determinants were collected from the nursing staff in the intensive care units and HSCTUs of the MHH by questionnaire (response rates: doctors: 71%; nurses: 63%) and by interviews with the responsible ward doctors and head nurses (100%). In 2013, 29 tailor-made techniques for behavior change in Training sessions and feedback sessions implemented in the six wards constituting the intervention arm of the study, while ASH training sessions were offered in the control arm (Results of the study) were determined by nonparticipant observation of World Health Organization gold standard hygienic hand disinfection. RESULTS: The two groups differed in 2013 not in their baseline compliance rates (intervention: 54%, control: 55%, p=0.581). Control arm rose to 68% in 2014 (p<0.001) but fell back to 64% in 2015 (p=0.007). The increases in compliance from 2013-2015 and the compliance rate in 2015 were higher in the intervention arm (p<0.005). This was mainly due to the behavior of the nurses, since the corresponding parameters for physicians in the stratified analysis did not differ significantly between the two study arms. CONCLUSION: Tailored interventions based on behavioral principles resulted in a more sustained increase in hand hygiene compliance than ASH training. This applied to nurses and thus to hospital staff as a whole (ie nurses and doctors together). Further studies are needed to identify more targeted interventions that may improve physician compliance.",0,1,
1473,Promoting recovery in schizophrenic patients: gap between routine practice and evidence. The SIEP-DIRECT project,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to show the main discrepancies between the evidence-based NICE guidelines for schizophrenia and the usual practices of the Italian psychiatric services, demonstrated by the SIEP-DIRECT'S project, to promote the recovery of patients with schizophrenia . METHODS: 41 indicators were developed based on the main NICE recommendations for promoting recovery. These were tested in 19 participating Italian psychiatric departments (MHD) or psychiatric services through self-evaluation of the activities carried out to promote patient recovery, with the aim of assessing the degree of compliance with the recommendations. The data required for most of the indicators were obtained from the psychiatric information system or from the management of the MHD. In addition, specific research was carried out on medical records and representative patient samples. In addition, for 14 indicators, an assessment was requested from 'multidisciplinary' or 'technical' focus groups, which then assigned a score according to a defined 'ad hoc' scale. RESULTS: According to the data received, while psychiatric services seem to care about the physical condition of their patients, they do not routinely assess key parameters such as blood pressure, blood glucose, etc., and collaboration with GPs is often complex or practiced inconsistently. Most psychiatrists and psychologists have the basic communication skills but lack sufficient competence in cognitive-behavioural therapy"";"" Such treatments, and any other form of structured individual psychotherapy, are rarely undertaken and seem to have become marginal activities within the services. Family psychoeducational interventions are also underused. The services are very active in caring for multi-problem schizophrenia patients, who make up a large percentage (almost a quarter on average) of the patients in their care. These patients are offered specific and integrated treatment plans involving other health services and social organizations operating in the area. The strategies used by the services for pharmacological treatment in relapse prevention and for patients with frequent crises or with treatment-resistant schizophrenia are all in line with the NICE recommendations. Finally, the services encourage vocational training and supported employment activities, the results of which, however, are often unsatisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study paint a picture of Italian mental health services with bright but also dark areas in relation to recovery promotion activities. Services seem to guarantee appropriate pharmacologically evidence-based treatments, integrated care and good management of multi-problem patients. However, they face difficulties in monitoring patients' physical health, psychotherapeutic activities, including for families, and promoting supported employment. In addition, they still show problems in structuring and formalizing care processes. To improve this situation, they should make more use of professional guidelines, protocols and written procedures.",0,0,
1474,Promotion of screening mammography in inner-city settings: a randomized controlled trial using computer-assisted reminders as part of a mammography facilitation program,"In a one-year randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of a computerized mammography reminder system as part of a program to increase the use of mammography screening at three health care facilities serving inner-city women in Detroit, Michigan (two locations of a health department, an HMO location and two locations of a private hospital). 4,401 women over the age of 40 who had attended a study center in the previous year were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Limited intervention (LI) included training physicians and staff on breast cancer control, simplified mammography scheduling procedures, and eliminating patient costs for mammography (at three of five sites). The full intervention (FI) included all of the components of the limited intervention plus an additional set of cues-to-action. These included a mammography reminder form to be placed in the medical records of women scheduled for mammography to increase physician referrals for mammography appointments, and patient reminders to be used to encourage mammography for referred women raise. During the one-year intervention period, 2,725 randomized women attended one study center. 6-month mammography visits in FI women vary from 38% to 65%, and the FI rate exceeds the LI rate at each site with differences ranging from 13% (95% CI, 6 to 20) to 29% (21 to 38). . The annual completed mammography rate in FI women ranges from 43% to 64% and exceeds the LI rate at each site by 12% (5 to 19) to 25% (16 to 34). After age adjustment, the effect sizes of the mammography intervention were not significantly different between the five sites. The average increase in FI compared to LI was 18%. The computerized reminder system is effective in increasing the use of mammography at each of the study sites, and the primary effect is physician referral for mammography.",0,1,
1475,Promoting self-management through adherence in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals: a study protocol,"UNLABELING: Background Heart failure is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in adults, resulting in prolonged morbidity, recurrent hospitalizations and an enormous economic burden on the healthcare system. Heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals or primarily critical access hospitals have higher 30-day readmission and mortality rates compared to patients discharged from urban hospitals. Self-management improves heart failure patient outcomes and reduces rehospitalizations, but adherence to self-management guidelines is low. We propose a home post-acute care service led by experienced nurses to improve patient activation and lead to improved self-management compliance in heart failure patients discharged from rural hospitals. Aim This article describes the study design and research methods used to conduct and evaluate the intervention. Method Our intervention is a 12-week Patient Activated Care at Home [PATCH] to improve self-management compliance. Patients were randomized into two parallel groups (12-week PATCH intervention + usual treatment vs. usual treatment only) to assess the effectiveness of this intervention. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Discussion This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a rural theory-based, nurse-led, activation-enhancing intervention on self-management compliance in heart failure patients living in rural areas. Our expectation is to facilitate heart failure patients' adherence to self-management behavior after discharge from rural hospitals, and reduce complications and hospital readmissions, resulting in a reduction in economic burden.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an intervention targeted at physicians and their patients on CRC screening rates. DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial involving general practitioners and their patients. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four community primary care physicians were randomly assigned to an intervention consisting of academic detailing and direct mailings to patients or a control group. Patients aged 50 to 79 years in the doctors in the intervention group received a letter from their doctor, a booklet on CRC screening, and a packet of fecal occult blood (FOBT) testing cards. MEASUREMENTS: At 1 year, we measured receipt of: (1) FOBT in the past 2 years, (2) flexible sigmoidoscopy (SIG) or colonoscopy (COL) in the past 5 years, and (3) any CRC screening. We report the percent change from baseline in both groups. RESULTS: 9,652 patients were enrolled for 2 years and 3,732 patients for 5 years. There was no increase in CRC screening that occurred in the intervention group for patients enrolled for 2 years (12.7 increase versus 12.5%, P=0.51). Similar results were observed for each CRC screening in patients enrolled for 5 years (9.7% increase vs. 8.6%, P=0.45). The only outcome affected by the intervention was the patients' screening SIG rate (increase of 7.4% vs. 4.4%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: With the exception of an increase in SIG rates in the intervention group, the intervention had no effect on CRC screening rates. Future interventions should evaluate innovative approaches to increase rates of CRC screening.",0,1,
1477,Promotion and prescription of hormone therapy according to the Women's Health Initiative harm report,"Context Little is known about how the pharmaceutical industry responds to evidence of harm related to their products, such as: Dose Prempro dealt significant damage and lacked net benefit. Objective To study the pharmaceutical industry's response to the GHI E+P results by analyzing hormone therapy advertising spending before and after July 2002. Design and Setting Nationally representative and prospectively collected longitudinal data (January 2001 to December 2003) on the prescription and promotion of hormone therapy were collected sourced from IMS Health and Consumer Media Reports. Key Outcome Measures Trends in quarterly hormone therapy prescriptions and spending for 5 forms of drug advertising: sample, practice-based detailing, hospital-related advertising, magazine advertising, and direct mail. Results Prior to the WHI E+P report, prescription rates and advertising spend for hormone therapy were stable. In the quarter preceding the GHI E+P report (April-June 2002), 22.4 million hormone therapy prescriptions were filled and US$71 million was spent on advertising (annualized US$350 per year per US physician). Within 9 months of the report's publication (Q1 2003), there was a 32% decline in hormone therapy prescriptions and a nadir in advertising spending (37% decline compared to pre-GHI E+P). levels). Spending on all advertising and most hormone therapies went down. Overall, the largest decreases were in samples (36% decrease from Q1 2003) and direct mail (100% decrease). The largest decreases in production occurred for standard-dose Prempro (61% decrease from Q1 2003), the compound mentioned in the GHI E+P report. More recently, there has been an increase in promotional activity, particularly for lower-dose Prempro, a resurgence that has been associated with slightly increased prescriptions for this newer compound. Conclusions Consistent with its widespread use, hormone therapy was one of the most heavily advertised drugs prior to the WHI E+P report. Following the reporting of the evidence of harm from this study, there has been a significant decrease in advertising spending for hormone therapy, particularly for the compounds most directly involved in the study. Coupled with the impact of the study results themselves and subsequent media coverage, reduced advertising may have contributed to a significant decrease in hormone therapy prescriptions.",0,0,
1478,Proper antibiotic therapy. From penicillin to pharmacogenomics,"Antibiotics have always been considered one of the miracle discoveries of the 20th century. Flaming's use of penicillin ushered in the golden era of antibiotics and is now an integral part of antibiotic-free medical practice. Life-threatening infections such as meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremic pneumonia, sepsis would in turn prove fatal. Aggressive chemotherapy and transplant procedures would also prove impossible. Another real miracle was the rise in antibiotic resistance shortly after the clinical use of penicillin in hospitals and communities. Several studies have shown overprescribing of antibiotics for community and inpatients, and in some hospitals up to 50% of antibiotic use is inappropriate: the benefits of antibiotic treatment come with the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. In hospitals, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are associated with higher mortality, morbidity, and longer hospital stays compared to infections caused by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria. A variety of strategies have been proposed to reduce costs and improve the quality of drug use. Education, guidelines and evidence-based recommendations are considered essential elements of any prescribing influencing program and can provide a knowledge base that improves and increases the acceptance of stewardship strategies. Evidence-based recommendations, a clinical practice approach that helps make decisions based on clinical expertise and a thorough knowledge of the individual patient's situation, beliefs, and priorities, improve antimicrobial management, including appropriate selection, dosage, type, and Duration of antibiotic therapy can maximize clinical cure or infection prevention while limiting unintended consequences such as emergence of resistance, adverse drug reactions and costs. These evidence-based guidelines are not a substitute for clinical judgment and clinical discretion is always required in their use. Genomic studies have identified hundreds of genetic polymorphisms that are important determinants of therapy efficacy, and several studies have demonstrated the successful use of pharmacogenomic testing to reduce the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in patients. If a patient's phenotype is known prior to therapy, drugs can be prescribed at the optimal dose and type to achieve better patient care.",0,0,
1479,Infection prophylaxis after appendectomy: a review of current surgical practice,"Two hundred and eighty questionnaires were sent to junior surgical staff across England asking about their use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, topical antibacterial agents and surgical drainage in appendectomy. One hundred seventy-five (63%) responses were received from 81 of the 87 hospitals included in the survey. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics were used by 78 surgeons (46%) when operating on a normal appendix, but by 168 (99%) when the organ was perforated. Most surgeons started antibiotics before surgery, but proportionately fewer did so when the appendix was gangrenous or perforated. Patients with severe contamination tended to receive longer courses of antibiotics, although the duration of administration varied significantly. Metronidazole was included in over 95% of all prophylactic therapies and was often combined with other drugs when the appendix was gangrenous and perforated. Topical antibacterials were routinely applied to the wound by only 45 surgeons (26%), although 106 (61%) sometimes used them. Povidone iodine was the most commonly used agent. Only 98 surgeons (56%) ever drained appendectomy wounds, while 135 (77%) sometimes drained the peritoneal cavity. There is evidence that current methods of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis should be continued, but that topical agents and surgical drains may be unnecessary if surgeons are confident of the effectiveness of the systemic treatment being used.",0,0,

METHODS - A randomized pilot study using three systems with an independent randomized follow-up study using two of these systems was conducted in 186 patients who were on long-term treatment or who had recently started and been discharged from warfarin treatment. RESULTS - All three computerized systems appeared to provide satisfactory control compared to the traditional dosing method. In patients receiving more intensive treatment with an assigned target range of 3.0-4.5, computerized dosing programs achieved significantly better control"";"" medical staff undertreated such patients in almost 50% of cases. CONCLUSION – Computerized programs can support outpatient anticoagulant control with warfarin during both early and long-term treatment. In most patients, the control achieved is as good as that achieved by the usual method of dosing by experienced clinical physicians, although the latter tend to be overly conservative when treating patients within the intensive target range of 3.0 to 4.5 Dose International Normalized Ratio (INR). .

DESIGN Prospective study with completion of questionnaires before coronary artery bypass graft and three months, one year and five years after. ADJUSTMENT Regional Cardiothoracic Center. PATIENTS 100 male patients, all under 60 years of age at the time of surgery, who were patients of two cardiothoracic surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Patient assessment of their health status in relation to functional capacity and aspects of burden according to the Nottingham Health Profile and outcome of surgery in relation to changes in symptoms, work life and daily activities determined by self-completed study questionnaires prior to surgery as well as three and six months after. RESULTS One year interim results are reported. The differences between the Nottingham Health Profile scores before surgery and three months after surgery were significantly different (p<0.01), indicating a noticeable improvement in general health, and compared favorably with those of a normal male population at one year. The analysis of the answers to the study questionnaire showed that 65 of 89 patients (73%) were employed one year after the operation, another seven (8%) stated that they were able to work but could not find a job. The proportion of patients complaining of chest pain decreased from 90% (88/98) before transplantation to 19% (17/89) one year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, with 91% (81/89) of patients maintained their condition as either completely better or definitely improved. The significant positive factors influencing return to work and home activities were work prior to surgery, short wait times for surgery, absence of dyspnoea, and a low score for physical mobility in the Nottingham health profile (all p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Improvements in general health, symptoms and activity were seen three months and one year after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Interventions likely to influence outcomes included reducing wait times for surgery, rehabilitation initiatives, and paying more attention to the quality of information given to patients, their families, and the community.",0,0,

We anticipate that the algorithm will increase the rate and timeliness of blood lactate and blood culture sampling, chest x-rays and antibiotic delivery. Methods A prospective before-and-after study with consecutive recruitment evaluated an algorithm that automatically identified adult patients who had 2 or more Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria and 2 or more blood pressure measurements less than or equal to 90 mm Hg during their accumulated Emergency Department (ED) stay. In phase 1, the system collected information but did not alert caregivers. In phase 2, the nursing staff were informed about the patient's possible illness via alphanumeric paging and a text entry in the electronic patient file and provided with specific recommendations. Results Patients (33,460) were screened over a 6 month period; 398 patients activated the system, including 184 (46%) who were appropriately identified as severely septic. The algorithm had a positive predictive value of 54% and a negative predictive value of 99% in detecting severe infections with acute organ dysfunction. The median time for patients to accumulate SIRS and blood pressure criteria was 152 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 71 to 284 minutes), underscoring the dynamic nature of emergency critical illness diagnosis and the need for detection algorithms Repeatedly assess patients during their evaluation After performance, 2 procedures were performed more frequently, pre-admission chest X-ray (odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.5) and blood culture collection (odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 7.7) Only blood culture tests were performed significantly faster when a decision aid was present (median time to culture before inter-invention 86 minutes, IQR 31, 296 minutes; mean time to culture after intervention 81 minutes, IQR 37, 245 mi groove P=0.032 after Cox proportional hazards modelling).

In 2012, the Chinese Ministry of Health issued a regulation on antibiotic prescriptions, limiting it to <20% of all outpatient prescriptions, but no operational details on the implementation of the guidelines were released. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a multidimensional intervention aimed at reducing antibiotic use in children (aged 2 to 14 years) with acute upper respiratory tract infections in rural primary care settings in China by reducing prescribing behavior of the doctors are changed and the parents/carers are educated. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a pragmatic, parallel-group, controlled, cluster-randomized superiority study with blinded interpretation of outcomes and data analysis and open-label treatment. From two counties in Guangxi province, 12 township hospitals will be randomized to the intervention arm and 13 to the control arm. In the control group, treatment of antibiotic prescriptions continues through usual treatment through clinical consultations. In the intervention arm, a provider- and patient/carer-centered intervention will be embedded in routine primary care practice. Provider intervention includes operational guidelines, systematic training, peer review of antibiotic prescribing, and provision of health education to patient caregivers. We will also provide patient caregivers with printed training materials and training videos.

1490,Protocol for a systematic review of assessment research for adults who participated in the SMART recovery mutual support program,"INTRODUCTION: Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) offers an alternative to the prevailing 12-step approaches to mutual aid (e.g., anonymizing alcoholics). Although the principles (e.g. self-efficacy) and therapeutic approaches (e.g. motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy) of SMART Recovery are evidence-based, further clarity is needed regarding direct evidence of its effectiveness as a mutual support package. Compared to methodologically rigorous reviews supporting the effectiveness of 12-step approaches, SMART Recovery's reviews to date have been descriptive. Our aim is to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the evidence for SMART recovery in adults with problematic alcohol, substance and/or behavioral dependence, including a commentary on the outcomes assessed, potential mediators, feasibility (including economic results) and a critical assessment of the methods used. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The methods follow the Cochrane guidelines for systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Statement. 6 electronic peer-reviewed and 4 gray literature databases were identified. Preliminary searches of SMART recovery literature were performed (liberal inclusion criteria, not limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), exclusively qualitative designs excluded).

If followed, medication can reduce relapse. However, despite compliance, relapse remains common and functional outcomes often remain compromised. Compliance is also usually low. Cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality are also increased, along with several important modifiable health risk behaviors. Access to psychosocial interventions is therefore important but currently limited. Telephone interventions represent a promising solution, although further clarity is needed. Accordingly, we aim to provide an overview and critical analysis of the current evidence for telephone-delivered psychosocial interventions that target important health priorities in adults with a psychotic disorder, including (1) relapse, (2) psychotropic drug adherence, and/or (3) modifiable risk behavior for cardiovascular health.

Attitudes towards PrEP by healthcare providers will be critical to translating this insight into effective public health adoption programs. In a sample of 186 healthcare providers in Peru, we assessed knowledge, barriers, and attitudes about prescribing and monitoring HIV PrEP for high-risk MSM and transgender women, the populations with the highest incidence of HIV in this setting. A total of 57.5% reported awareness of PrEP, and awareness was independently associated with caring for more than 50 MSM (OR: 3.67, p<0.002). The lack of local guidelines, concerns about increased risk behaviors, antiretroviral drug resistance, and the limited availability of antiretroviral drugs for HIV-infected individuals were the most common barriers to prescribing PrEP. Of all physicians, 44.6% said they are now likely to prescribe oral PrEP"";"" the likelihood of prescribing was higher when PrEP was supported by local guidelines (70.3%, p<0.001), when more studies demonstrated its effectiveness (68.5%, p<0.001), and when intermittent use was shown to be effective ( 62.2%, p<0.001). =0.019).

1494,Vendor Details: An Intervention to Reduce Prescription Opioid Deaths in Utah,"BACKGROUND: Utah has embarked on a multifaceted effort to reverse an epidemic of deaths among patients taking prescription opioids. This article describes the part of the effort that details the provider. METHODS: Presentations highlighting six recommended prescribing practices were developed and presented to healthcare workers. Participants were encouraged to use the state prescribing database and complete a series of surveys that assessed changes in confidence and behavior at 0, 1, and 6 months after presentation. Credits for continuing medical education encouraged participation. RESULTS: Utah's drug-related overdose deaths decreased 14.0% in 2008 compared to 2007 after program implementation. A total of 581 doctors and numerous non-medical health professionals were reached in 46 presentations. Follow-up surveys on the level of acceptance of practice changes were completed by 366 participants at 0 months, 82 participants at 1 month, and 29 participants at 6 months. Combined results for all three assessments showed that 60-80% of responding physicians reported that they no longer prescribe long-acting opioids for acute pain or with sedatives”; 50% reported using the Utah Controlled Substances Database during patient care and using lower starting doses and slower escalations;"" and 30-50% reported receiving ECGs and sleep studies in eligible patients, using patient education tools, and prescribing guidelines of Utah. CONCLUSIONS: Provider disclosure was associated with a decrease in the mortality rate from prescription opioids in Utah and improvements in the provider's self-reported prescribing behavior. Other concomitant interventions may have contributed to the decrease in mortality rates. The effect of this intervention was enhanced by short-term funding limited.",0,0,
1495,Provider training to promote the implementation of clinical practice guidelines,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although interest in and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines has increased significantly over the past two decades, concerns remain about their actual implementation. This article focuses on one strategy to promote guideline implementation at the clinical level: clinician education. The aims of the article are to review educational strategies, to place them in the context of complementary strategies carried out at the organizational and clinical levels, and to outline challenges and recommendations for continuing education of clinicians. METHODS: Experience and data from relevant randomized clinical trials within an educational setting are reviewed. COMMENTS: The implementation of clinical practice guidelines requires a variety of skills including assessment, adequately describing a treatment and monitoring plan, patient tracking, and patient counseling and education. Learning strategies need to reflect the content and teaching methods that best fit the learning objectives. The pressures of today's practice limit the resources, particularly the clinician's time, that are available for continuing education. Organizational resources must be allocated to build the complementary support systems needed for improved clinical practice. In addition to physicians, training must target non-physician clinical staff, office staff, and administrators who are also responsible for implementing the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: To meet the challenges of developing clinician motivation, balancing competing demands, and treating patients with complex diseases, clinical leaders must design educational activities that are supported by leadership, reflect compelling evidence, and employ multiple strategies and teaching techniques, and engage learners in skill building and problem solving.",0,0,
1496,Providing feedback on social norms for high antibiotic prescribers in general practice: a pragmatic national randomized controlled trial.,"Background Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to antibiotic resistance. In this study we aimed to reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics by General Practitioners (GPs) in England. Methods In this randomized, 2 × 2 factorial study, publicly available databases were used to identify GP practices whose antibiotic prescribing rate was in the top 20% for their local National Health Service (NHS) team. Eligible practices were randomly (1:1) divided into two groups by a computer generated matching sequence layered by the NHS Local Area Team. Participants, but not investigators, were blinded to group assignment. On September 29, 2014, each GP in the feedback intervention group received a letter from the UK Chief Medical Officer and a leaflet on antibiotics for use in patients. The letter states that the practice prescribes antibiotics more than 80% of the practices in its local NHS team. Primary care physicians in the control group received no communication. The sample was again randomized into two groups and in December 2014 GP practices either received patient-centred information encouraging reduced antibiotic use or received no notification. The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotics dispensed per 1000 weighted population, accounting for past prescriptions. The analysis was intended to treat. This study is registered and completed with the ISRCTN registry under number ISRCTN32349954. Results Between September 8 and 26, 2014, we recruited 1581 primary care practices and assigned them to feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups. Letters were sent to 3227 general practitioners in the intervention group. Between October 2014 and March 2015, the rate of antibiotics dispensed per 1000 population was 126·98 (95% CI 125·68–128·27) in the feedback intervention group and 131·25 (130·33). ""132 x 16) in the control group, a difference of 4 x 27 (3 x 3%"", incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0 x 967 [95% CI 0 x 957-0 x 977]; p<0 x 0001), which represents an estimated 73–406 fewer antibiotics dispensed.As of December 2014, primary care practices were assigned to the patient-centered intervention groups (n=777) or the control group (n=804) between December 2014 and March 2015 had no significant impact on the primary outcome measure (antibiotics dispensed per 1000 inhabitants: 135 00 [95% CI 133 77–136 22] in the patient-oriented intervention group and 133 98 [133 06–134 90] in the control group, IRR for difference between the groups 1 01, 95% CI 1 00 – 1 02, p = 0 105) Interpretation of social norm feedback from a high-profile messenger can significantly reduce antibiotic p prescribing at low cost and at the national level;"" This finding makes it a useful adjunct to antimicrobial stewardship programs.",1,1,
1497,Providing mothers of babies in the ICU with recorded conversations with neonatologists: randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether providing mothers of babies in the NICU with tapes of their conversations with a neonatologist improves information recall and psychological well-being. DESIGN Randomized, single-blinded study. SETTING Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, North Queensland, Australia. PARTICIPANTS 200 mothers of babies in a neonatal intensive care unit. INTERVENTIONS Mothers gave (n=102) or not (n=98) tapes of their conversations with a neonatologist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Recall of information, attitudes towards the tape and its use, satisfaction with interviews, postnatal depression, anxiety, general health status, and stress related to parenting at 10 days and four and 12 months. RESULTS 91% (n=93) of the mothers in the cassette group listened to the cassette (once at day 10, twice at four months, and three times at 12 months; range 1-10). At 10 days and four months, mothers in the tape group remembered significantly more information about diagnosis, treatment, and outcome than mothers in the control group. At four months, mothers in the tape group were 75% more likely to remember all information about treatment as mothers in the control group (59% vs. 34%; risk ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.4). Six mothers, all in the control group, could not remember their conversations. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in interview satisfaction (10 days), postnatal depression and anxiety scores (10 days, four, and 12 months), and parenting stress (12 months). CONCLUSION Providing mothers of babies in the NICU with tapes of conversations with a neonatologist improved their recall of information (up to four months). The recorded conversations did not affect the mothers' well-being or satisfaction with the neonatologist. STUDY REGISTRATION Australian Clinical Trials Registry 12606000478516.",0,0,

1499,Psychoeducation: Improving Outcomes in Bipolar Disorder,"BACKGROUND: A relevant paradigm shift in the treatment of bipolar disorder began several years ago"";"" Critical evidence on the usefulness of psychological interventions clearly supports the shift from an exclusively pharmacological approach to therapy to a combined but hierarchical model in which pharmacotherapy plays a central role, but psychological interventions can help bridge the gap that exists between theoretical efficacy and effectiveness in the ""real world"". We hereby examine the effectiveness of several concomitant psychotherapies in the maintenance therapy of bipolar patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search on this topic was conducted using the MEDLINE and CURRENT CONTENTS databases. The keywords entered were “bipolar”, “psychotherapy”, “psychoeducation”, “cognitive-behavioural” and “relapse prevention”. RESULTS: Psychological treatments specifically designed for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder are useful tools in conjunction with mood stabilizers. Most recently published psychotherapy studies report positive results for maintenance as an add-on treatment and effectiveness in treating depressive episodes. Interestingly, several groups from around the world reported similar positive results and came to very similar conclusions"";"" Almost every intervention tested contains important psychoeducational elements, including both improving compliance, early detection of prodromal signs—emphasizing the importance of a regular lifestyle—and exploring patients' health beliefs and disease awareness. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of psychotherapy in improving adherence and clinical outcome in bipolar patients is now undisputed, and future treatment guidelines should encourage its regular use among clinicians. As clinicians, our primary mission is to provide our patients with the best available treatment, and this includes both evidence-based psychoeducational programs and newer pharmacological agents.",0,0,
1500,Psychological and behavioral interventions for the treatment of insomnia disorders: An evidence review for a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians,"BACKGROUND: Psychological and behavioral interventions are commonly used for sleep disorders. PURPOSE: To assess the benefits and harms of psychological and behavioral interventions for sleep disorders in adults. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsycINFO through September 2015, supplemented by manual search. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of psychological or behavioral interventions published in English and included adults with insomnia that lasted 4 or more weeks. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction by a single reviewer, confirmed by a second reviewer""; Risk of bias assessment by two reviewers;"" Consensus determination of the strength of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty studies with low to moderate risk of bias compared psychological and behavioral interventions with inactive controls or other psychological and behavioral interventions. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) improved global and most post-treatment sleep outcomes, often compared to informational or wait-list controls (moderate-strength evidence). CBT-I use improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low-to-moderate-strength evidence). Multicomponent behavioral therapy improved several sleep outcomes in older adults (low-to-moderate-strength evidence). Stimulus control improved 1 or 2 sleep outcomes (low-strength evidence). There was insufficient evidence for other comparisons and for harm to draw any conclusions. LIMITATIONS: A large number of comparisons limited the ability to summarize data. Studies did not always report global outcomes and rarely performed remitter or responder analyses. Comparisons were often to informational or wait-list groups, and publication bias was possible. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CBT-I improves most outcomes compared to inactive controls. Multicomponent behavioral therapy and stimulus control may improve some sleep outcomes. Evidence on other outcomes, comparisons, and long-term efficacy was limited.",0,0,
1501,Psychological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder: recommendations for the clinician based on a literature review,"This article provides an overview of available research data supporting the use of psychotherapy in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors highlight how this evidence could inform clinical decisions in the management of PTSD and show how assumptions based on gaps in the available literature can be misleading. The authors first discuss results on a range of interventions commonly used in the treatment of trauma victims or patients with PTSD: stress debriefing of critical incidents, psychoeducation, exposure therapy, eye movement desensitization, reprocessing, stress vaccination therapy, trauma management therapy, cognitive therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and hypnotherapy. They also discuss a number of treatment strategies that have recently been explored in PTSD, including imagery exercises, memory structure interventions, interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. PTSD is associated with significant symptomatic morbidity, although the desired outcomes in clinical practice are more typically related to reducing social, interpersonal, and occupational impairments. The most methodologically sound studies, which have typically examined cognitive or behavioral treatments, show that psychotherapy helps reduce the severity of symptoms”; However, there is no consistent information on whether these interventions are helpful in improving other areas of impairment and associated disability, although these issues are often the greatest concern for patients. Also, the available evidence does not indicate when and to whom different psychotherapeutic interventions should be provided, or whether different treatment modalities can and should be combined or offered sequentially, as is often the case in specialized treatment programs. Clinicians should keep these issues in mind when reviewing the literature for current (and future) clinical research. Unfortunately, the current evidence base on psychotherapy for PTSD provides only limited guidance for clinical decisions in the management of PTSD. The authors therefore provide some literature-based clinical guidelines for clinicians treating patients with PTSD.",0,0,
1502,Psychometric analysis of the R18V2 three-factor diet questionnaire in adolescent and young adult-aged central nervous system tumor survivors,"PURPOSE: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors are an understudied population at risk of developing adverse health outcomes such as obesity. Long-term follow-up guidelines recommend monitoring of those at risk for obesity, which justifies the need for an eating behavior questionnaire. An abbreviated online version of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18v2) has been developed, but its applicability to this population is not yet known. This study examined the factor structure and reliability of the instrument in this population. METHODS: CNS tumor survivors of AYA age (n = 114) aged 15 to 39 years completed the TFEQ-R18V2 questionnaire online. The fit of the three-factor structure (uncontrollable eating, cognitive restraint and emotional eating [EE]) and reliability (internal consistency of the TFEQ-R18v2) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis. Associations between the three factors and body mass index (BMI) were assessed by linear regression. RESULTS: The theorized three-factor structure was supported in our population (RMSEA = 0.056 and CFI = 0.98) and showed good reliability (alpha of 0.81-0.93). EE (beta = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02-0.13) was positively associated with BMI, while the other two subscale scores were not. CONCLUSION: The TFEQ-R18v2 instrument shows promise for research and clinical use in AYA-aged CNS tumor survivors. The instrument can be a useful tool for researchers to develop tailored weight management strategies. It can also be a valuable tool for clinicians to monitor and facilitate referral of survivors at risk for obesity. Our results also suggest that EE should be further explored in this population as a potential target for intervention.",0,0,

1504,Psychosocial aspects in cardiac rehabilitation: from theory to practice. A position paper from the Cardiac Rehabilitation Section of the European Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation of the European Society of Cardiology,"Numerous empirical studies show that psychosocial risk factors (PSRFs) such as low socioeconomic status, social isolation, stress, type D personality, depression and anxiety increase the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and also contribute to poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and Prognosis in patients with existing CHD. PSRFs can also act as barriers to lifestyle changes and therapy adherence, and mitigate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). In addition, there appears to be a bidirectional interaction between PSRFs and the cardiovascular system. Stress, anxiety and depression affect the cardiovascular system through immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral pathways. In turn, CHD and associated treatments can cause conditions in patients, including anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, PSRFs can be assessed using single-item screening questions, standardized questionnaires, or structured clinical interviews. Psychotherapy and medication can be considered to alleviate any PSRF-related symptoms and improve HRQoL, but the evidence for a clear beneficial effect on cardiac endpoints is inconclusive. Comprehensive CR should include a multimodal behavioral intervention that integrates counseling for PSRFs and disease management. Patients with clinically significant symptoms of distress should be referred for psychological counseling or psychologically focused interventions and/or psychopharmacological treatment. In summary, the success of CR can critically depend on the interdependence of mind and body, and this interdependence needs to be addressed through the assessment and management of PSRFs consistent with sound scientific evidence by trained personnel integrated into the CR core team is to be reflected.",0,0,

1506,Putting evidence into practice: Evidence-based interventions in sleep-wake disorders,"Symptom management is an essential aspect of oncology nursing practice. The Oncology Nursing Society has identified outcomes that are responsive to nursing interventions, known as care-sensitive patient outcomes. This article provides information on sleep-wake disorders seen in cancer patients and provides recommendations for evidence-based interventions to improve patients' sleep. Sleep-wake disorders occur in 30-75% of cancer patients and negatively impact other symptoms and quality of life. Despite the frequency and severity of sleep-wake disorders, limited research has tested interventions to improve sleep-wake outcomes. Although no intervention currently receives the highest recommendations for implementation in practice, several non-pharmacological interventions are showing early positive results in promoting quality sleep and daytime functioning. Oncology nurses can examine sleep-wake disorders and suggest tailored interventions. Four categories of promising interventions are cognitive behavioral therapy, complementary therapies, psychoeducation and information, and exercise. Clinicians can use the Putting Evidence Into Practice (PEP) card and PEP resources at www.ons.org/outcomes to improve sleep-wake outcomes.",0,0,
1507,Put prevention into practice,"In primary care institutions, disease prevention services are provided at lower prices than recommended. Additionally, practitioners tend to overestimate the speed at which they perform them. There are two main steps in delivering evidence-based prevention services: (1) knowing the evidence for performing various detection and intervention maneuvers, and (2) integrating prevention services into daily practice. The first is a scientific process and is conducted in Canada by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. However, after a decade of experience with evidence-based guidelines, we know that guidelines are not enough. Integrating clinical prevention into busy practices is a political and logistical process. This truth is best captured by the joke, ""An ounce of prevention takes a pound of office system change."" A number of studies have shown that continuing education courses and workshops for physicians are not sufficient to anchor clinical prevention in practice. According to Lomas, the traditional CME educational approaches need to be complemented by strategies from such paradigms as the social impact model, the diffusion of innovation model and the adult education model. In “From Science to Practice”, Battista points out the complexity of the communication process required for the dissemination of innovation in practice. Walsh's systems model of clinical prevention best captures the interacting factors that mediate between physicians' intentions and their actions when it comes to the delivery of clinical preventive services. This paper reports on a practical example of supporting GPs in developing a ""supporting practice system in prevention"" that minimizes barriers, focuses energy and integrates clinical prevention into everyday practice. The key components are (i) a practice coordinator for prevention, (ii) clear clinical prevention-related job descriptions for everyone involved with patients, (iii) an information management system that reinforces prevention, and (iv) a practice feedback and problem-solving strategy.",0,0,
1508,Qualitative data collection and analysis methods: the INSTINCT study,"Patient care practices often lag behind current scientific knowledge and professional guidelines. The failure of such knowledge translation (knowledge translation, KT) efforts may reflect inadequate assessment and addressing of specific barriers faced by both physicians and patients at the treatment level. Effective KT in this setting can benefit from using qualitative methods to identify and overcome these barriers. The qualitative methodology allows for an in-depth study of the barriers associated with adopting practice changes and has rarely been used in emergency medicine research. The authors describe the methodology for the qualitative analysis as part of the INCreasing Stroke Treatment through INteractive Behavioral Change Tactics (INSTINCT) study. This includes processes for valid data collection and reliable analysis of the text data from focus group and interview protocols. INSTINCT is a 24-hospital, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate a systems-based barrier assessment and an interactive educational intervention to increase the appropriate use of tissue plasminogen activators (tPA) in ischemic stroke. Intervention hospitals undergo a basic barrier assessment using both qualitative and quantitative (survey) techniques. Investigators will receive data on local barriers to tPA use, as well as information on local attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding acute stroke management. Target audiences at each site include emergency physicians, emergency room nurses, neurologists, radiologists, and hospital administrators. Transcript analysis using NVivo7 with a predefined barrier taxonomy is described. This will provide both qualitative insight into thrombolytic use and the importance of specific barrier types for each site. The qualitative findings then steer the form of professional further education efforts and system interventions at treatment centers.",0,0,
1509,Qualitative research within trials: development of a standard operating procedure for a clinical trials department,"BACKGROUND: Qualitative research methods are increasingly used in clinical trials to answer broader research questions than can be addressed with quantitative methods alone. These methods enable healthcare professionals, service users, and other stakeholders to contribute their views and experiences to the evaluation of healthcare treatments, interventions, or policies, and to influence study design. Qualitative data often provides information that is better suited to reforming policy or influencing design. METHODS: Healthcare researchers, including study participants, clinicians, and qualitative researchers, collaborated to develop a comprehensive portfolio of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the West Wales Organization for Rigorous Trials in Health (WWORTH), a clinical trials unit (CTU). from Swansea University, which recently received registration with the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC). Although the UKCRC requires a total of 25 SOPs from registered CTUs, WWORTH chose to add an additional SOP for qualitative methods (QM-SOP). RESULTS: The SOP for qualitative methods (QM-SOP) defines best practices in the design and implementation of qualitative components of studies while allowing flexibility in approach and method. Its basic principles are: Qualitative researchers should contribute with qualitative potential from the beginning of studies; the qualitative component should have clear objectives;' and the main study publication should report on the qualitative component. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend CTUs to consider developing a QM-SOP to improve the execution of quantitative studies by adding qualitative data and analysis. We believe this will enhance the value of quantitative studies and contribute to the future development of multi-method studies.",0,0,

Methods Collaborative design of a quality score within the French clinical research project NosoQual. Feasibility and observational study in 46 surgical departments visited between November 2002 and March 2003 according to standardized procedures. A bibliographic review followed by expert consultations, a field test, an analysis and a final review leading to the definition of a consensual score. Results 138 variables comprised the score. They were divided into seven dimensions, each representing a different aspect of the quality of care in surgery. According to the threshold and weight assigned to each variable, scores were calculated for each division. The average degree of fulfillment of the scores varied between 42% and 71% of the theoretical maximum values. The variability of the scores related to the seven dimensions was greater and more significant than that expressed by the total score (coefficient of variation = 0.1). Conclusion This analytical work contributed to the design of a surgical quality score. However, the progress of the score should still take into account all observed obstacles and meet the high demands of the actual topic of patient safety.",0,0,

DATA SOURCES: Data collected from electronic medical records before and after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The sample size was smaller than expected, contributing to a lack of statistical significance from preintervention to postintervention in patient outcome measures. System-level variables that were under the direct control of clinicians (e.g., pneumococcal vaccine administered) showed a large improvement. Before the intervention, the percentage of “yes” responses to the system-level variables ranged from 8 to 24 and jumped to 16 to 95 after the intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This project has clearly demonstrated that system-level changes result in improved patient care"";"" However, these had minimal impact on patient outcome variables. It is difficult to encourage change in patient behavior, which may have contributed to the lack of significance in this domain, while variables could be more easily changed under the direct control of clinicians.",0,0,

METHODS: Two random samples of 660 MRs were reviewed. A four-step program was developed: (1) Initial assessment of the MR""; (2) Implementation of the MR quality, sending a letter with the purpose of the investigation, the results obtained in the first step from this station, the guidelines for correctly filling out the MR ; (3) next step four months later;"" (4) Comparison of the data before and after the distribution of the guidelines using indicators of the completeness of all sections of the MR, the clarity of the handwriting and the presence and clarity of the signature. Results: The main concerns related to the signature of the doctor on duty (present in 2.0% and legible in only 15.4%), the presence of the discharge letter (18.0%) and the clarity of the hospital days (32.0%) . After the procedure, the improvement in compilation quality was modest and affected medical rather than surgical wards. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The improvement was not satisfactory as the indicators should reach 100% clarity and completeness from a medical and legal point of view.

1514,Quality of pharmaceutical advertisements in medical journals: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Magazine advertising is one of the primary sources of drug information for physicians. Despite the availability of regulations and controls on drug advertising worldwide, information about drugs provided in journal advertisements has been criticized in several studies as substandard. However, no attempt has been made to systematically summarize these research results. We designed this systematic review to assess all studies that examined the quality of drug advertising for prescription products in medical and pharmaceutical journals. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases, web libraries, search engines, and citation checks (1950 - February 2006). Only articles published in English that examined the quality of information contained in pharmaceutical advertisements for prescription products in medical or pharmaceutical journals were included. For each eligible article, a researcher independently extracted data on study methodology and outcomes. The data were then reviewed by a second researcher. Any disagreements were resolved amicably. The data were analyzed descriptively. The final analysis included 24 articles. The studies examined advertisements from 26 countries. The number of journals examined in each study ranged from four to 24 journals. Several outcome measures were examined, including notices and claims in advertisements, availability of product information, compliance with codes or policies, and presentation of risk outcomes. The majority of the studies used a convenience sampling method. Brand name, generic name and particulars were usually given. Journal articles have often been cited to support pharmaceutical claims. Less than 67% of claims were supported by a systematic review, meta-analysis, or randomized controlled trial. Studies evaluating misleading claims had at least one ad with a misleading claim. Two studies found that less than 28% of the claims were clear clinical claims. Most displays with quantitative information provided risk results as relative risk mitigation. Studies have only been conducted in 26 countries and then the generalizability of the results is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this review suggests that low quality magazine advertising is a global problem. Because information in magazine ads can change physician prescribing behavior, continued efforts to improve drug advertising education are critical. The results of our review point to the need for a global proactive and effective regulatory regime to ensure that the information provided in medical journal advertising supports the quality use of medicines.",0,0,
1515,Quantitative comparison of cognitive-behavioral therapy and music therapy research: a best-practice methodological analysis to guide future investigations for adult psychiatric patients,"While the music therapy profession is relatively young and small, it can treat a wide variety of clinical populations and has built a diverse research base. However, although the profession has its origins in working with individuals diagnosed with mental illnesses, there is a significant lack of quantitative research on the impact of music therapy on this demographic. Music therapy clinicians and researchers have reported this lack of evidence and the difficulty in conducting psychosocial research on their interventions (Choi, 1997"";"" Silverman, 2003a). Although published studies have provided suggestions for future research, no study has made detailed suggestions for the methodology and design of thorough, high-quality, randomized, controlled, psychiatric music therapy research. How do other psychotherapies fill out their databases and could music therapy borrow from their rigorous ""methodological best practices"" to strengthen their own literature base? Therefore, as stated by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the treatment of choice for evidence-based psychotherapy is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), aspects of the literature base of this psychotherapy were analyzed. The purpose of this literature review was to (a) analyze and identify components of high quality quantitative CBT research for adult psychiatric users, (b) to analyze and identify the variables and other elements of existing quantitative psychiatric music therapy research for adult users, and (c ) compare the two datasets to identify the best methodological designs and variables for future quantitative music therapy research with the mental health population. A table analyzing randomized and rigorously controlled trials involving the use of CBT in individuals with severe mental illness is included to identify the key components of a quality experimental research design and implementation of quantitative clinical research. The table also shows the same analyzed components for existing quantitative psychiatric music therapy research involving adult consumers, highlighting potential areas and elements for future investigation. A second table shows a range of potential dependent measures and their sources to be evaluated in future music therapy studies. A third table with suggestions for future research is derived from a summary of the tables and is intended to guide researchers and encourage further development and expansion of the current literature base. The main part of the work is a discussion of the results of the literature analysis derived from the tables, meta-analyses and literature reviews. It is hoped that this report will result in the literature base of psychiatric music therapy being supplemented with future high-quality quantitative research, thus making evidence-based services available to as many people with mental illness as possible.",0,0,

1517,Quetiapine augmentation in depression: dosing patterns in routine practice,"This study evaluated the dosing patterns of quetiapine augmentation (QA) in major depressive disorder (MDD) in routine practice. Between January 1, 2009 and May 31, 2013, patients diagnosed with MDD and receiving QA in conjunction with an ongoing antidepressant were enrolled in this study. A total of 977 patients' electronic medical records and clinical data were reviewed for up to one year. Almost half of the patients continued QA treatment for more than 3 months. The mean duration of QA was approximately 6 months, and the mean starting and maintenance doses were 23.6 and 40.7 mg/day, respectively (range = 12.5-400 mg/day). The most frequently observed side effects were somnolence, followed by dry mouth and lethargy. Our results indicate that actual QA doses for MDD in routine practice should be lower than doses used in placebo-controlled clinical trials and those recommended by any regulatory agency. Sufficiently rigorous and well-controlled prospective studies are needed to better understand the precise role of low doses of QA in the management of MDD, particularly in routine practice.",0,0,

The guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity of at least moderate intensity, with activity most days. The most common physical activity of older people is walking, light intensity walking, moderate intensity at a more brisk pace. Less than 20% of UK 65-74 year olds say they have achieved the guidelines, although most are able to do so. Effective behavior change techniques include strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, building self-efficacy, and relapse prevention. The exercise advice in the basic care allows an individual adjustment of the advice. Pedometers measure the number of steps taken and accelerometers measure the intensity of physical activity. This protocol describes an innovative intervention to improve gait in the elderly that incorporates feedback from pedometers and accelerometers into a primary care nurse's physical activity consultation and uses behavior modification techniques. METHODS/DESIGN: DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with intervention and control arms (usual care) plus process and qualitative assessments. PARTICIPANTS: 300 people aged 60-74 registered in 3 general practices within the Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Primary Care Trusts were able to go outside and increase their physical activity without restrictions. INTERVENTION: 3-month intervention based on pedometers and accelerometers, supported by physical activity consultations in the in-office nurse. Four consultations based on behavior modification techniques, physical activity diary, average daily pedometer steps, and accelerometer feedback on physical activity intensity. Individual exercise plans are created based on increased walking and other existing physical activities. RESULTS: Change in mean daily steps (primary outcome) and mean weekly time spent in physical activity of at least moderate intensity (secondary outcome) at 3 months and 12 months, assessed by accelerometry. Other outcomes are quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, injuries. Qualitative analyzes will examine reasons for non-participation in the study, patient and caregiver acceptability of the intervention, and factors that promote or act as barriers to older people increasing their physical activity. DISCUSSION: The PACE-Lift study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an intervention to increase physical activity in older primary care patients. Measures to minimize bias and the expected challenges are discussed. Word Count 341. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN42122561.",0,0,
1519,"Randomized controlled trial of Alexander Technique Instruction, Exercise and Massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent low back pain","OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of lessons in the Alexander Technique, massage therapy, and advice from a physician to exercise (exercise prescription) along with behavioral counseling from nurses for patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain. DESIGN Factorial randomized study. RECRUITMENT 64 GP practices in England. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain; 144 were randomized to regular care, 147 to massage, 144 to six Alexander Technique sessions, and 144 to 24 Alexander Technique sessions; Half of each of these groups was randomly selected for exercise prescription. INTERVENTIONS Normal care (control), six massage sessions, six or 24 Alexander Technique lessons and exercise prescription by a physician with behavioral counseling by a nurse. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Roland Morris Disability Score (number of activities affected by pain) and number of days with pain. RESULTS Alexander Technique exercise and lessons, but no massage, remained effective at one year (compared to control Roland disability score 8.1: massage -0.58, 95% confidence interval -1.94 to 0.77, six lessons -1.40, -2.77 to -0.03 , 24 Lessons -3.4, -4.76 to -2.03 and Exercise -1.29, -2.25 to -0.34). The exercise after six lessons produced 72% of the effect of 24 lessons alone (Roland disability score -2.98 and -4.14, respectively). The number of days with back pain in the last four weeks was lower after classes (compared to control median 21 days: 24 hours -18, six hours -10, massage -7) and quality of life improved significantly. No significant damage was reported. CONCLUSIONS One-to-one instruction in the Alexander Technique by registered teachers has long-term benefits for patients with chronic low back pain. Six lessons followed by a practice prescription were almost as effective as 24 lessons. TEST REGISTRATION National Research Register N0028108728.",0,0,
1520,"Randomized controlled trial of Alexander Technique instruction, exercise and massage (ATEAM) for chronic and recurrent low back pain: economic assessment","OBJECTIVE To provide an economic evaluation of therapeutic massage, exercise and instruction in the Alexander Technique for the treatment of persistent low back pain. DESIGN Cost-impact study and cost-effectiveness analysis at 12 months follow-up of a factorial randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain were recruited from primary care. INTERVENTIONS Normal care (control), massage and six or 24 lessons in the Alexander Technique. Half of each group was randomly assigned a prescription for exercise from a doctor plus behavioral counseling from a nurse. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Cost to the NHS and participants. Comparison of costs using Roland-Morris Disability Score (number of activities impaired by pain), pain days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Comparison of NHS cost to QALY gain using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptance curves. RESULTS Intervention costs ranged from £30 for an exercise prescription to £596 for 24 Alexander Technique lessons plus exercise. Health services costs ranged from £50 for 24 lessons in Alexander Technique to £124 for exercises. Incremental cost-effectiveness analyzes of individual therapies showed that exercise offered the best value (61 pounds per point on disability score, 9 pounds per additional pain-free day, 2847 pounds per QALY gain). For two-step therapy, six Alexander Technique lessons combined with exercise was the best value (an additional 64 pounds per point on the disability score, 43 pounds per additional pain-free day, 5332 pounds per QALY gain). CONCLUSIONS At values above £20,000 per QALY, the probability that one practice prescription and six Alexander Technique lessons alone was more than 85% cost effective was higher, but the Alexander Technique outperformed practice on all outcomes. A combination of six Alexander Technique lessons followed by exercises was the most effective and cost-effective option.",0,0,
1521,Randomized controlled trial of integrated care to reduce disability from chronic low back pain in work and home life,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated care program that combines a patient-centered and a workplace-based intervention for patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN Population-based randomized controlled trial. RECRUITMENT Primary care (10 physical therapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals). PARTICIPANTS 134 adults aged 18 to 65 who had been on sick leave for at least 12 weeks due to back pain. INTERVENTION Patients were randomly assigned to usual care (n=68) or integrated care (n=66). The integrated care consisted of a participatory ergonomics-based workplace intervention involving a supervisor and a graded activity program based on cognitive behavioral principles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the length of time from incapacity (incapacity) to work due to back pain to full sustained return to work. Secondary endpoints were pain intensity and functional status. RESULTS The median time to sustainable return to work was 88 days in the integrated care group compared to 208 days in the usual care group (P=0.003). Integrated care was effective in returning to work (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8, P=0.004). At 12 months, patients in the integrated care group improved significantly more in functional status compared to patients in the usual care group (P=0.01). Pain relief between groups did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION The integrated care program has significantly reduced the disability caused by chronic back pain in private and professional life.

1522,Randomized controlled trial on tailored strategies to implement guidelines for the management of patients with depression in general practice,"BACKGROUND: Various methods are available to implement changes in the clinical behavior of general practitioners (GPs). Although passive dissemination of information is generally ineffective, other methods can have varying degrees of effectiveness. Few studies have examined the effects of tailored methods. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether methods tailored to overcoming barriers to change using psychological theories are more effective in implementing guidelines for depression in primary care physicians than dissemination alone. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sixty general practices in England”; 30 general practitioners in the control group, 34 in the intervention group. METHOD: Physicians identified patients with depression before and after implementation of the guidelines (control group n=192 in the first data collection, n=181 in the second; intervention group n=210 in the first data collection and n=197 in the second). Proportion of patients with a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score less than 11 at 16 weeks after diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the proportion of patients screened for suicidal risk was increased in the group of general practitioners who received tailored implementation. In the intervention group, the proportion of patients with BDI values less than 11 increased after 16 weeks. CONCLUSION: Implementation barriers can be identified and strategies developed to address them. The results indicate a new approach for research to understand and develop methods of implementation.",0,1,
1523,Randomized controlled trial of change in hospital management for unstable angina,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the usefulness of a guideline-based educational program to improve the management of unstable angina pectoris (UAP) in hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 37 public hospitals across New South Wales. PATIENTS: 1,872 patients admitted between February 1 and June 30, 1996 (baseline) with a UAP diagnosis and 1,368 patients with the same diagnosis admitted between July 1 and December 31, 1998 ( follow-up survey). INTERVENTION: Awareness sessions led by local thought leaders presenting National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines on management of UAP and feedback on local practice using data from the baseline survey. The meetings were held between March and June 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of evidence-based practices identified through review of medical records. RESULTS: Beta-blocker use increased in intervention and control hospitals, although the increase was only significant in the former. The use of calcium channel blockers decreased significantly in both intervention and control hospitals. However, the change in drug use between baseline and follow-up did not differ significantly between intervention and control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some reasonable changes in drug use for UAP management between 1996 and 1998, there was no evidence that a guideline-based training program was of benefit in management change. This again confirms the difficulty of changing physician behavior through practice guidelines. Alternative methods of promoting evidence-based practice should be considered.",0,0,
1524,Randomized trial of an integrated education strategy to reduce screening rates in young women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated educational strategy to change clinical behavior and reduce the number of hysteroscopies and/or dilatations and curettage in women younger than 40 years with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with six-month follow-up. SETTING: Gynecological departments of the public teaching hospital with 12,000-13,000 relevant procedures per year. PARTICIPANTS: Six public gynecology units consisting of 62 gynecologists or trainees randomly assigned to an intervention group—three or control—opinion leaders and a laminated algorithm and guidelines. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of hysteroscopies and/or dilations and curettage performed for DUB in women under 40 years of age, change in clinical behavior, and perceived booking rates of the procedure. RESULTS: At six months, there was no significant effect on the number of hysteroscopies and/or dilatations and curettage performed, but there was an increase in evidence-based behavior. CONCLUSIONS: While the evidence-based educational strategy for the appropriate screening of young women with DUB resulted in a change in clinical behavior when applied to theoretical cases, it did not result in a reduction in hysteroscopy/D&C rates at six months.",0,0,
1525,Randomized Clinical Trial of a Custom Electronic Alert Requiring a Positive Response Versus a Control Group Receiving a Commercial Passive CPOE Alert: NSAID - Warfarin Co-Prescribing Test Case.,"Background studies looking at the effectiveness of computerized decision support systems in preventing drug-drug interactions have reported modest results due to poor vendor response to the automated alerts. Objective To evaluate the incremental effectiveness of an alert requiring a provider response within an inpatient Computerized Doctor Order Entry (CPOE) system intended as a stronger intervention to prevent concomitant warfarin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) orders. 1963 Design Randomized clinical trial with clinicians assigned to either an intervention group that received a custom electronic alarm requiring a positive response or a control group that received a commercially available passive alarm as part of the CPOE. The study period was from August 2, 2006 to December 15, 2007. Measurements Alert adherence was compared between study groups. Results The proportion of desired ordering reactions (ie no reordering of the alarm-triggering medication after dispensing) was lower in the intervention group (114/464 (25%) issued individual alarms) than in the control group (154/560 (28%) passive alarm triggering). The adjusted OR of inappropriate order was 1.22 (95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Conclusion A custom CPOE alert that required a physician response had no effect in reducing co-prescribing of NSAIDs and warfarin beyond that of the commercially available passive alert received by the control group. New CPOE warnings to improve prescribing cannot be assumed to be effective and need to be evaluated.",1,1,
1526,Randomized controlled clinical efficacy trial of cognitive behavioral therapy versus usual care for persistent insomnia in cancer patients,"PURPOSE: Persistent insomnia is a common complaint in cancer survivors but is rarely treated satisfactorily. Matching a validated, cost-effective intervention to cancer treatment may be a viable solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy of protocol-guided cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia performed by oncology nurses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Randomized, controlled, pragmatic, two-center study of CBT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in 150 patients (103 females; mean age 61 years) who were on active therapy for breast, prostate, colon, or gynecologic cancer. The study was in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Primary endpoints were sleep diary measurements at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Actigraphic sleep, health-related quality of life (QOL), psychopathology, and fatigue were secondary measures. CBT consisted of five small group sessions over consecutive weeks following a manual protocol. TAU represented normal clinical practice;"" the appropriate control for a clinical efficacy study. RESULTS: CBT was associated with an average reduction in wakefulness of 55 minutes per night compared with no change in TAU. These results persisted 6 months after treatment. The standardized relative effect sizes were large for complaints of difficulty falling asleep, waking up from sleep during the night, and sleep efficiency (percentage of time spent asleep in bed.) CBT was associated with moderate to large effect sizes on five out of seven QOL outcomes, including one significant reduction in daytime sleepiness. There was no significant interaction effect between these endpoints and demographic, clinical, or baseline sleep characteristics. CONCLUSION: CBT for insomnia may be both clinically effective and practically feasible.",0,0,
1527,Randomized controlled study of a computer strategy to improve general practitioner screening,"BACKGROUND: Previous interventions targeted at primary care physicians and aimed at improving preventive care have shown limited effectiveness. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-assisted medical education program to increase rates of three screening behaviors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and cervical cancer screening) and to identify three risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, benzodiazepine use). . in general practice. METHODS: Nineteen general practitioners were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Those who received the intervention received a computerized feedback system. The procedure was performed via a touch screen computer located in the surgery waiting area. The preventive behaviors of interest were smoking, alcohol use, benzodiazepine use, and blood pressure, cholesterol, and cervical screening using the Papanicolou test. Differences in performance by group in each of the outcomes were measured at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Logistic regression analyzes with generalized estimation equations were carried out as the main analyses. RESULTS: At 3 months follow-up, statistically significant differences were evident in the following outcome measures: accurate classification of benzodiazepine users (z=2.8540, P<0.05)"", accurate classification of non-benzodiazepine users ( z=2.7339, P<0.05); accurate classification of dangerous or harmful alcohol drinkers (z=2.3079, P<0.02); blood pressure screening (z=3.4136, P<0.001);"" and cholesterol screening (z=6.6313, P<0.001).

1528,Randomized controlled trial of a computer-adapted multiple health behaviors intervention in general practice: 12-month follow-up results,"BACKGROUND: Effective strategies to address noncommunicable disease risk factors are needed to contain rising healthcare costs. This study tested the effectiveness of a minimal intervention targeting multiple health behaviors (diet, physical activity, alcohol, and smoking) in a general practice by providing personalized computer-tailored feedback over a one-year period. METHODS: Patients who had attended a GP practice in the previous 6 months were recruited from 21 GPs in Brisbane, Australia. Baseline data was collected from self-reported adherence to ten health behaviors and summarized into a 0 to 10 health score. This randomized controlled trial used a 2x2 factorial design, with one arm randomly assigning subjects to the intervention or control group. The other arm was either feedback at baseline (single contact) or an additional assessment with feedback at 3 months (dual contact). As such, 4 study groups were formed into which the participants were blindly randomized: A. Intervention with one-on-one contact; B. Dual contact intervention; C. Single Contact Control; and D. Dual Contact Control. All participants were reassessed. RESULTS: Of the 4676 randomized participants, 3065 completed the questionnaires at 12 months. Both single and dual contact groups improved their 10 item health scores (+0.31 and +0.49, respectively) compared to the results of the control group (+0.02; p<). 0.01). Improvement in adherence to guidelines for fish consumption, milk consumed, vegetable and fruit consumption, and alcohol consumption was observed in single and double contact intervention groups (p<0.01). Both intervention groups showed greater improvement than controls for the individual Health behaviors other than red meat consumption, smoking behavior, physical activity, and body weight. Interestingly, there was an improvement in reported smoking rates in both the intervention and control l groups (3% single exposure; 4.5% dual exposure). CONCLUSIONS: Small but meaningful long-term changes in health behavior can be achieved with a low-intensity intervention that, if implemented widely, can reduce healthcare costs. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanism by which maintenance of behavior change can be achieved.

1529,Randomized controlled trial to provide education and feedback on implementation of acute low back pain guidelines,"OBJECTIVE: The effect of clinical guidelines on resource use in complex conditions with significant barriers to clinical behavior change has not been well studied. We report the impact of a multifaceted guideline implementation intervention on primary care physician utilization of radiological and specialized services for the management of acute low back pain. DESIGN: Physician groups were randomized to receive guideline training and individual feedback, supportive patient training materials, both or neither. Impact on compliance and resource utilization were assessed during the 12-month period before and after implementation. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen physician groups with 120 primary care physicians and associated practitioners from 2 group model HMO practices. INTERVENTIONS: A training/audit/feedback model with local opinion leaders was used in the implementation of the guideline. The patient education component included written and videotaped material on the management of back pain. MAIN RESULTS: Clinical intervention was associated with an absolute increase in guideline compliance of 5.4% in the intervention group compared to a decrease of 2.7% in the control group (p=0.04). The patient education intervention did not bring about a significant change in guideline-compliant behavior, but was only insufficiently accepted. Patient characteristics, including duration of pain, history of low back pain, and number of visits during the illness episode, were strong predictors of service utilization and guideline-compliant behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a training- and feedback-supported guideline for the treatment of acute low back pain for general practitioners was associated with an increase in guideline-compliant behavior. Patient education materials did not improve the effectiveness of the guideline. Implementation barriers could limit the usefulness of this approach in common care settings.",0,0,
1530,Randomized controlled trial of cardiovascular risk management by practice nurses supported by self-monitoring in primary care,"UNTITLED: BACKGROUND: Treatment goals for cardiovascular risk management are generally not met. Specialized practice nurses are increasingly making the work of general practitioners easier, and self-monitoring devices have been developed to provide advice. The aim of this study was to compare standard of care supported by self-monitoring versus standard of care without self-monitoring, both performed by practice nurses, in terms of cardiovascular risk and individual risk factors. METHODS: Men aged 50-75 years and women aged 55-75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes but with a SCORE 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality >/= 5% and at least one treatable Risk factor (smoking, high blood pressure, lack of exercise or obesity) were randomized into two groups. The control group received standard treatment in line with the guidelines, the intervention group also received proactive advice and self-monitoring (pedometer, scales and/or blood pressure monitor). After one year, the treatment effect was analyzed in 179 participants. RESULTS: The SCORE risk score decreased by 1.6% (95% CI 1.0-2.2) for the control group and by 1.8% (1.2-2.4) for the intervention group, the difference between groups was 0.2% (-0.6–1.1). Most risk factors tended to improve in both groups. In the intervention group, the number of visits was higher and the visits took longer (4.9 (SD2.2) vs. 2.6 (SD1.5) visits p < 0.001 and 27 (P25 - P75:20-33 ) vs. 23 (P25-P75:19-30) minutes/visit p= 0.048).

We conducted a group randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a PHCLW in promoting shared care. METHODS: Primary health care teams from Stockport Health Authority, North West England, were randomly assigned to either an intervention arm, which was offered the services of a PHCLW, or a control arm, which was offered standard support from the local drug team (CDT). The proportion of CDT clients with a history of regular opiate abuse who were in co-care 12 months after randomization was compared across study arms. RESULTS: Eighteen (24.0 percent) of the 75 CDT clients in the intervention arm, but none of the 80 CDT clients in the control arm were in co-care at 12 months (chi2 = 9.37, df = 1, p<0.01 "";"" 95 percent confidence interval 8.6-39.4 percent).

DESIGN: Two-arm randomized study with a duration of 12 months. SETTING: Italian general practitioner departments. Subjects A total of 3,186 men and women aged 18-65 years were admitted to the medical unit by their general practitioners. INTERVENTIONS: An educational intervention and brochure on the basics of healthy eating based on the Italian guidelines for proper nutrition, 1998. The main objective of the study was to achieve an intake of fruits and vegetables of >5 servings per day. Follow-up check every 6 months. The main outcome measures weight, blood pressure and a 40-item food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: The intervention group showed a slightly reduced net intake of meat and a slightly increased net intake of fruit and vegetables, fish products, and olive oil. Body mass index (BMI) changed only in the treatment arm [-0.41 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.11 to -0.53]. The net change at 1 year in the intervention arm was +1.31 (CI 0.90-4.39) for fruits and vegetables and -0.22 (-0.11 to -0.69) for meat (servings per week). We also calculated a ""Healthy Eating Score"" that reflects adherence to recommended eating habits. In the intervention group, the mean at recruitment was significantly lower than the mean at the end of follow-up (change in raw score = 0.29""; CI 0.19-0.48). No differences were observed in the control group (change in raw score = -0.04; ""CI -0.22-0.02). The difference in score from baseline to last visit comparing the intervention to the control group was statistically significant (P<0.001) (MANOVA adjusted for gender, BMI, education and time).

1534,Randomized Trial of a Clinical Decision Support System: Implications for the Treatment of Children with Unidentified Source Fever.,"Aim: To evaluate adherence to a clinical decision support system (CDSS) for the diagnostic management of children with fever without an identifiable source and to investigate the impact of using the CDSS on the time spent in the emergency department (ED) and the number of laboratory tests. Design: The CDSS was used by ED nurses to register children presenting with a fever. The CDSS identified children who met the inclusion criteria (1-36 months and fever without apparent source (FWS)) and provided patient-specific diagnostic treatment recommendations. Children at high risk of serious bacterial infections were randomly assigned to the ""intervention"" (n _x0001_ 74) or the ""control"" (n _x0001_ 90) group. In the intervention group, the CDSS advised that laboratory tests be ordered immediately, and in the control group, the ED doctor first examined the children and then decided to order laboratory tests. RESULTS: Adherence to registration of febrile children was 50% (683/1,399). Adherence to the recommendation to order laboratory tests was 82% (61/74). Children in the intervention group had a median (25th-75th percentile) length of stay in the emergency department of 138 (104-181) minutes. The median length of stay in the emergency room in the control group was 123 (83-179) minutes. Laboratory tests were ordered significantly more frequently in the intervention group (82%) than in the control group (44%, p 0.001, _x0001_2 test). Conclusion: The implementation of a CDSS for the diagnostic management of infants with fever without an identifiable source was successful in terms of adherence and adherence to CDSS recommendations, but had unexpected implications for patient outcome in terms of length of ED stay and count of laboratory tests. The use of the current CDSS has been discontinued.",1,1,
1535,Randomized study of model predictive control for improved anemia management,"Background and Objectives: A variable hemoglobin (Hb) response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can lead to undesirable outcomes. The utility of model predictive control for drug dosing has been previously demonstrated. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled study testing model predictive control for dosing of erythropoietin in ESRD patients. The study included 60 hemodialysis patients who were randomized to a treatment arm (30 subjects) that received erythropoietin doses based on the computer recommendations or a control arm (30 subjects) that received erythropoietin doses based on recommendations from a standard anemia Management received log (control). The subjects were followed for 8 months and the proportions of measured Hb within the target range of 11 to 12 g/dl and outside of 9 to 13 g/dl were measured. Hb variability was measured using the absolute difference between the achieved Hb and the target Hb of 11.5 g/dl and the area under the Hb curve. Results: The model predictive control revealed 15 observations >13 or <9 g/dl (outliers), a mean absolute difference between the achieved Hb and 11.5 g/dl of 0.98 ± 0.08 g/dl and an area under the Hb curve of 2.86 ± 1.46. The control group algorithm resulted in 30 Hb outliers (P=0.051), produced a mean absolute difference between achieved Hb and 11.5 g/dL of 1.18 ± 0.18 g/dL (P<0.001 difference in variance) and an area under the Hb curve of 3.38 ± 2.69 (P = 0.025 difference in variance).

METHODS: Sites were selected as either lecture or PBL with simple randomization. All participants were exposed to similar educational resources to ensure equivalence of treatment. The tools included standardized programme/speaker rating forms and a validated case-based questionnaire with a visual analogue scale measuring the confidence level of the responses. The latter was presented immediately before and after the intervention and 3 months later. The statistician was blinded to intervention groups. RESULTS: A total of 52 general practitioners agreed to participate, 23 to the PBL sessions (mean 4.6 per group) and 29 to the didactic lecture sessions (mean 7.25). There was no significant difference between the groups in knowledge gain for each test administration. Participants rated the instructor or facilitator as equally good for creating a positive learning environment. PBL participants rated the perceived educational value of the program higher than lecture participants (4.36 vs. 3.93; p=0.04). Both groups experienced a significant increase in asthma-related knowledge after the intervention. Turnover rates for the 3-month posttest were 14% for PBL participants versus 32% for lecture-based participants. DISCUSSION: PBL was as effective at acquiring and retaining knowledge as lecture-based continuing education (CME) programs. Further studies are warranted to examine whether the assessment of higher educational value or an increase in delayed test response rate is reproducible in other RCTs addressing common confounders and whether these factors influence future CME participation, changes in clinical behavior of physicians or patient health outcomes.",0,0,
1537,Randomized study to improve prescription safety in outpatient elderly patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether a computerized tool that alerted pharmacists when patients 65 years of age and older were being re-prescribed potentially inappropriate medications was effective in reducing the proportion of patients dispensing those medications. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized study. SETTING: US health care organization. PARTICIPANTS: All 59,680 health plan members aged 65 years and older were randomized to receive intervention (n=29,840) or usual care (n=29,840). Pharmacists received notifications for all patients randomized to the intervention who were newly prescribed a targeted drug. INTERVENTION: Prescribing and age information was linked to alert pharmacists when a patient age 65 years or older was prescribed any of 11 medications that may be inappropriate for the elderly. MEASUREMENTS: Physicians and pharmacists collaborated to develop the targeted medication list, indications for medication use for which intervention should be made, intervention guidelines and scripts, and implementation of the intervention. RESULTS: During the 1-year study, 543 (1.8%) patients aged 65 years and older in the intervention group received new prescriptions for targeted medications, compared with 644 (2.2%) patients in the usual care group (P = 0.002). For medication indications that warrant intervention, the deliveries of amitriptyline (P<0.001) and diazepam (P=0.02) were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a computerized pharmacy alert system and collaboration between healthcare professionals in reducing potentially inappropriate medication spending in elderly patients. The coupling of data available from information systems with the knowledge and skills of physicians and pharmacists can improve prescription safety for patients aged 65 and over.",1,1,
1538,Randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of simulation teaching: A 24-month follow-up study in a clinical setting,"BACKGROUND: The knowledge and skills of critical care nurses to follow evidence-based guidelines to prevent complications associated with intubation and mechanical ventilation are currently limited. We hypothesized that a single simulation training session would result in sustained higher levels of proficiency in critical care nurses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from February 2012 to March 2014 in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Finland. Thirty of 40 originally randomized critical care nurses participated in a 24-month follow-up study. Behavior and cognitive development were assessed using a validated ventilation bundle observation plan and questionnaire at baseline and repeated 3 times during simulation and in real clinical conditions. RESULTS: After the simulation training, the mean competence score increased from 46.8% to 58.8% of the total score in the final postintervention measurement (P-time < 0.001, P-time x group = 0.040, and P-group = 0.11). The mean knowledge values within the groups did not change significantly. The mean difference between groups in competency scores was significant only when measured at 6 months (P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Critical care nurses' skills in adhering to evidence-based guidelines improved over time in both groups, but improvements between study groups were significantly different only at 6 months and were no longer evident at 2 years after a single simulation training session.",0,0,
1539,Rapid Change in Prescribing Behavior in Hospitals Participating in the Guidelines - Stroke after Approving Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients (MATCH) Clinical Trial Results,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physician prescribing patterns are changing slowly, despite published randomized trials and consensus guidelines. We measure the effect of the Management of Atherothrombosis With Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients (MATCH) study on the prescribing patterns of stroke and transient ischemic attack patients in the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke Program. METHODS: We analyzed the discharge prescription patterns of antithrombotic drugs for patients admitted to hospitals participating in GWTG-Stroke between October 2002 and January 2006 with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Clinical information by quarter was analyzed in relation to the publication of the MATCH study. The frequency of discharge prescription of aspirin + clopidogrel after MATCH publication was compared to the pre-MATCH period after patient and hospital characteristics were adjusted and clustered by hospital. RESULTS: A total of 107,872 patients at 632 sites were eligible for antithrombotic therapy at discharge. Use of aspirin + clopidogrel therapy decreased from 22.4% to 15.4% of patients after publication of MATCH (adjusted OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.70, p<0.0001 ). Quarterly analysis revealed a rapid and sustained decline in aspirin + clopidogrel therapy use for the remainder of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: After publication of the MATCH study without MATCH-specific GWTG stroke initiatives and prior to an update of the American Heart Association guidelines, a rapid and sustained reduction in the frequency of aspirin + clopidogrel use in ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack was observed .",0,0,
1540,Rational prescribing in primary care (RaPP): Economic evaluation of an intervention to improve professional practice.,"Background Interventions aimed at bridging the gap between research findings and clinical practice can be effective but also costly. Whether such interventions are worthwhile can be assessed on the basis of economic evaluations. We assessed the economic impact of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The tailored intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial and was shown to significantly increase thiazide use in patients who started antihypertensive medication, but had little or no effect on other outcomes. It was not to be expected that the increased use of thiazides would have an impact on the health consequences. Methods and Results We performed cost minimization and cost-effectiveness analyzes on data from a randomized study of 146 general practices from two geographic areas in Norway. Each practice was randomly assigned to either the tailored intervention (70 practices; 257 physicians) or the control group (69 practices; 244 physicians). Only patients who were started on antihypertensive medication were included in the analyses. A multi-faceted intervention was tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders. Pharmacists conducted the visits. A cost minimization framework was put in place, comparing the cost of the intervention with the reduced cost of treatment (mainly due to the increased use of thiazides instead of more expensive drugs). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as the cost per additional patient started on thiazides. The annual net cost (cost minimization) in our study population was $53,395, equivalent to $763 per practice. The cost per additional patient who started thiazides (cost-effectiveness) was US$454. Annual net savings in a national program were modeled at $761,998, or $540 per practice at 2 years. In this scenario, savings exceeded costs in all but two of the sensitivity analyzes we performed, and cost-effectiveness was estimated at $183. Conclusions We found a significant shift in antihypertensive drug prescribing towards the use of thiazides in our study. A key reason for promoting the use of thiazides is their lower price compared to other drugs. The cost of the intervention more than doubled the savings within the time frame of our study. However, we project modest savings over a 2-year period.",0,1,
1541,"Rationale and design of the study to evaluate the effect of cardiovascular drugs provided as a low-cost, evidence-based generic samples (SAMPLES) study","BACKGROUND: Highly effective generic cardiovascular drugs are often underused, leading to higher overall drug costs and cost-related nonadherence. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate an intervention to promote the appropriate use of generic cardiovascular drugs without creating administrative or financial barriers that might impede the use of essential drugs. STUDY DESIGN: The SAMPLES study (Study Assessing the Effect of Cardiovascular Medications Provided as Low-cost, Evidence-based Generic Samples) is a clustered, randomized, controlled study of the effect of providing free generic samples of hydrochlorothiazide to patients with hypertension and simvastatin to patients with hyperlipidemia. We will randomize 660 primary care physicians in Pennsylvania, grouped by physician practice, to receive free samples for both conditions or not to receive samples. We will use data on prescriptions issued from a government-sponsored prescription drug support program to conduct an intention-to-treat assessment of the impact of the intervention on physician prescribing behavior (proportion of generic prescriptions) and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes include physician adherence to established guidelines and overall prescription drug costs. CONCLUSION: This study will define the potential role of an innovative approach in promoting clinically appropriate, cost-effective prescribing. We will determine whether free generic drug trials can reduce overall drug costs and patient costs without compromising efficacy, and whether this approach leads to improved adherence to essential cardiovascular drugs. This intervention can also improve adherence to practice guidelines and improve the quality of care received. If successful, this strategy could be used extensively by private insurers or government payers to promote cheaper, better quality care.",0,0,
1542,Reasons and consequences of poor adherence to standard precautions by the care team,"Standard Precautions (SP) are recommendations to prevent infection and protect healthcare workers during care, however, there is still low adherence to these recommendations. Objective To analyze the reasons and consequences of low compliance by nursing staff with Standard Accommodations. Method Integrative literature search, search in seven databases, from 2005 to 2014. Results 30 articles were selected for analysis. The proven reasons for low compliance relate to poor lifelong learning practices, risky behavior by workers, insufficient provision of equipment and protective equipment, and poor working conditions. The consequences are accidents and occupational diseases. There are few intervention studies that merely provide guidance to professionals. Conclusions Low compliance with standard accommodations is related to individual aspects of workers, employers and educational institutions. The intervention strategies implemented have proven to be ineffective if they only focus on the worker.",0,1,

1545,Recent trends in violent behavior among high school students in the United States,"Context Violent behaviors such as fighting and carrying weapons have serious physical and psychosocial consequences for young people. Objective To measure trends in nonfatal violent behavior among youth in the United States between 1991 and 1997. Design, Setting, and Participants Nationally representative data from the 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys were analyzed to determine the percentage of students describe in grades 9 through 12 who exhibited violent behaviors. The overall response rates for each of these years were 68%, 70%, 60%, and 69%, respectively. To assess the statistical significance of time trends for these variables, logistic regression analyzes controlling for sex, class, and race or ethnicity while assessing linear and higher-order effects were performed. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported carrying of weapons, physical combat, combat-related injuries, feeling unsafe, and damaged or stolen property. Results Between 1991 and 1997, the percentage of students engaged in physical combat decreased by 14%, from 42.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.1% - 44.9%) to 36.6% (95% CI , 34.6% - 38.6%). ""; the percentage of students who were injured in a physical fight decreased by 20%, from 4.4% (95% CI, 3.6% - 5.2%) to 3.5% (95% CI, 2.9% - 4.1%)); and the percentage of students who carried a gun decreased by 30%, from 26.1% (95% CI: 23.8% - 28.4 %) to 18.3% (95% CI: 16.5% - 20.1%), 25%, from 7.9% (95% CI, 6.6% - 9.2%) to 5 .9% (95% CI, 5.1%-6.7%); the percentage of students engaging in physical fights on school premises decreased by 9% (95% CI, 15, 0% - 17.4%) to 14.8% (95% CI, 13.5% - 16.1%));"" and the percentage of students carrying a gun on school property decreased by 28%, from 11.8% (95% CI, 10.4%-13.2%) to 8.5% (95% CI, 7th .0% - 10.0%). All of these changes represent significant linear decreases. Conclusions The declines in hostilities and gunplay among US youth between 1991 and 1997 are encouraging and consistent with the declines in homicide, nonfatal victimization, and school crime. Further research should examine why behaviors related to interpersonal violence are declining and what types of interventions are most effective.",0,0,
1546,Recommendations for treating depression in community-based older adults,"OBJECTIVE: To present recommendations for community-based treatment of depression in the elderly to public health and aging networks. METHODS: In April 2006, an expert panel of mental health and public health researchers and community-based practitioners on aging was convened to formulate consensus-based recommendations. In making recommendations, panelists considered the feasibility and appropriateness of community-based delivery, as well as the strength of evidence on the program's effectiveness from a systematic literature review of articles published up to 2005 at home or in the primary care setting. The panel recommended individualized cognitive behavioral therapy. Interventions not recommended as primary treatments for depression in old age included education and skills training, comprehensive geriatric health assessment programs, exercise, and physical rehabilitation/occupational therapy. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations for several categories of interventions, including group psychotherapy and psychotherapies other than cognitive behavioral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This interdisciplinary expert panel decided that the recommended interventions should be disseminated in the public health and aging networks, recognizing the challenges and barriers involved. Interventions that were not recommended or had insufficient evidence often did not treat depression primarily and/or did not include a clinically depressed sample while attempting to establish efficacy. These interventions may provide other benefits but should not be assumed to be effective in treating depression on their own. Panelists also identified primary prevention of depression as a much understudied area. These findings should help both individual physicians and public health decision-makers in the delivery of population-based mental health services in diverse community settings.",0,0,
1547,Referral service for chronic disease patients in the home setting with multimodel sensors,"With advanced technologies in hand, there are potential applications and services around monitoring the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) of elderly people in care homes. Most of the elderly in these institutions suffer from various chronic diseases such as dementia. Existing technologies mainly focus on non-drug interventions and monitoring of ADL to address loss of autonomy or well-being. Monitoring and management of ADL-related cognitive behaviors for non-drug interventions are very effective in improving the condition of dementia patients. However, patients' cognitive functions can be improved if appropriate drug recommendations are made at a given time. Previously, we developed the Secured Wireless Sensor Network Integrated Cloud Computing for Ubiquitous-Life Care (SC(3)). The SC(3) services were limited to monitoring the ADL of older people with Alzheimer's disease and providing non-drug recommendations to the patient. In this article, we propose a system called Smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an integral part of the SC(3) platform. The Smart CDSS gives patients access to medication recommendations from medical specialists. Physicians are provided with an interface to create clinical knowledge for medication recommendations and to monitor the patient's condition. The clinical knowledge created by physicians as the knowledge base of the Smart CDSS gives nursing staff recommendations for medications based on each patient's symptoms.",0,0,
1548,Recruiting hospital patients for research: how do participants differ from eligible non-participants?,"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence for guidelines and interventions. Nevertheless, a large part of the population in question refuses to be examined. OBJECTIVE: To identify differences between participants and eligible non-participants in (1) perceived stress, (2) self-efficacy, (3) expectations of recovery, (4) discussion of advance directives, and (5) understanding of a standard prescription label (health literacy). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental prospective cohort study in 5 acute care hospitals. METHODS: We approached 295 inpatient hospital patients when they were recruited for a behavioral intervention and asked them to answer 5 screening questions. We matched respondents' responses to their acceptance of the behavioral intervention and to Medicare entitlements and enrollment data. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare agreement rates based on responses to screening questions. SETTING/PATIENTS: Hospitalized Medicare patients with fee. RESULTS: Patients were less likely to agree to the behavioral intervention when they reported feeling unable to control important things in their lives (odds ratio [OR]: 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0 .14-0.92) and had low expectations of recovery (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.06-0.45) or were confused by some question (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05 -0.24). Conversely, people who answered the medication question incorrectly were more likely to agree with the behavioral intervention (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.12-13.03). There were no significant differences in compliance among patients who felt overwhelmed or reported having discussed proactive treatment planning with family members or physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Eligible non-participants in the hospital differ in terms of perceived stress, expectancy of recovery, and health literacy. Recognizing such features can inform strategies for improving in-hospital intervention recruitment and representation in clinical trials.",0,0,

1550,Recurrence after surgical treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa,"From six to 89 months after surgery, 82 patients treated by radical surgery (118 excisions) for intractable hidradenitis suppurativa were examined. Local recurrence rates varied widely with disease site and were low after axillary (3%) and perianal (0%) surgery and high after inguinoperineal (37%) and submammary (50%) excision. Recurrences result from inadequate excision or an abnormally wide distribution of apocrine glands, but physical factors such as obesity, local pressure, and skin maceration played a role in some patients. Recurrences due to inadequate surgery tended to be the most problematic. At follow-up, 75 (91%) patients were satisfied with the results of their surgery. A quarter of the patients developed disease at a new anatomical site after surgery. Radical surgery provides good symptomatic control of severe suppurative hidradenitis of the axillary, groin, and perianal regions, but is less satisfactory in submammary disease.",0,0,
1551,Redesigning the “choice architecture” of hospital prescribing tables: a mixed-methods study that includes in situ simulation testing.,"Objectives To incorporate behavioral insights into the user-centered design of an Imperial Drug Chart Evaluation and Adoption Study (IDEAS table) and determine whether changes in the content and design of prescribing tables could affect prescribing behavior and reduce prescribing errors. Design A “mixed methods” approach was followed in the development phase of the project; In situ simulations were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the newly developed IDEAS prescribing table. Setting A teaching hospital in London. Interventions/Methods A multimodal approach that includes: (1) an exploratory phase consisting of chart reviews, focus groups, and gathering user insights, (2) the iterative design of the IDEAS prescription chart, and finally (3) testing of the final chart with prescribing physicians using an in situ simulation Results Significant differences were found between existing inpatient prescription charts used in 15 different UK hospitals. Review of 40 completed prescribing charts from a hospital revealed a number of common prescribing errors, including illegibility and difficulties in identifying the prescribing physicians. Insights from focus groups and direct observations were incorporated into the design of the IDEAS table. Situ simulation tests showed significant improvements in prescribing t Comparison of the IDEAS table with the prescribing table currently used at the study hospital. Medication orders on the IDEAS table were significantly more likely to include correct dose entries (164/164 vs. 166/174; p=0.0046) as well as the printed name of the prescribing physician (163/164 vs. 0/174; p<0.0001) and contact number (137/164 versus 55/174; p<0.0001). Anti-infective indication (28/28 vs. 17/29; p<0.0001) and duration (26/28 vs. 15/29; p<0.0001) were more likely to be populated using the IDEAS table. Conclusions In a simulated context, the IDEAS Prescribing Table significantly reduced a number of common prescribing errors, including dosing errors and illegibility. Positive behavioral changes were observed without prior education or support, suggesting that some common prescribing errors may simply be caused by changes in the content and design of Prescription tables can be fixed is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial (CC BY-NC 4.0) license which allows others to distribute, remix, adapt, onto this work non-commercially and license their derivative works under different terms, provided the original work is properly cited and the use is non-commercial.

1553,Reducing the amount of blood transfused: a systematic review of behavioral interventions to change physician transfusion practices,"BACKGROUND: Transfusion services have used various techniques to reduce the use of blood products. Given the potential adverse effects of transfusions and the resources expended in implementing transfusion reduction strategies, there is a need to understand their effectiveness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review to examine the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in reducing blood product use. METHODS: We identified all relevant articles using electronic searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as hand searches of review articles and personnel files. The electronic searches included articles published between January 1966 and May 2003. Searches included blood transfusion, plasma exchange, policy, education, practice patterns, and professional practice. Outcomes of interest were the number of units transfused and the proportion of patients who received transfusions. RESULTS: Nineteen studies examining the effectiveness of single (guidelines, prospective audits, retrospective audits, and reminders) or multifaceted interventions to reduce RBC, platelet, plasma, cryoprecipitate, and albumin transfusions met inclusion criteria. Eighteen studies showed a relative reduction in the number of units administered (range 9% to 77%) or the proportion of patients receiving transfusions (range 17% to 79%). The reported reductions were qualitatively similar for the different blood products tested. No particular intervention or combination of interventions appeared to be more effective in reducing enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral interventions, including simple interventions, appear to be effective in changing physician transfusion practices and reducing blood consumption. Appropriately designed clinical trials are still needed to determine the relative effectiveness of different practice change interventions.",0,1,

1555,"Reducing overuse of therapeutic injections through interaction group discussions between patients and prescribing physicians in Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania","Inappropriate prescribing of injections has been reported in both developing and industrialized countries. Previous studies in Tanzania showed that over 70% of patients visiting outpatient clinics in private pharmacies received at least one injection per consultation, a figure above the WHO recommended target of 10%. This is of concern given the likelihood of adverse effects from the potential use of unsafe syringes to transmit HIV, hepatitis B and C, poliomyelitis, and additional economic implications for the patient and healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the impact of behavioral change interaction group discussions on injectable prescribing practice in ten selected community pharmacies in Kinondoni District, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Patient injection prescription records were obtained from 5 randomly selected control and 5 randomly selected intervention facilities for the three month period prior to the study. Maternal and prescribing physician IGDs were performed at each health facility for one month, followed by a survey 3 months after IGD to determine the impact of IGDs. Statistical chi-square calculations were performed to compare the data on the percentage of prescriptions with one prescribed injection and those conforming to national standard of care (STG) between baseline and 3-month follow-up. The results showed no significant difference between the percentage of prescriptions with an injection prescribed at baseline and the 3-month follow-up in community pharmacies (P>0.05, X2 test). Prescribed injections that matched STG were low at baseline and did not improve significantly at 3 months thereafter (P>0.05, X2 test).

1556,Reducing rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia through a staff education program,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in patients on mechanical ventilation, leading to increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and costs. Preventive measures for VAP are well documented and evidence-based, but are still poorly implemented in most ICUs. We conducted a pre- and post-intervention observational study to assess whether an educational program focused on preventive practices for VAP could reduce incidence. 677 adult patients who were mechanically ventilated > 48 h were included in the study population. An evidence-based guideline for preventive bedside interventions was developed and distributed to ICU staff. VAP incidence rates before and after the implementation of the educational program were compared. VAP infection rates reduced by 51%, from a mean of 13.2 +/- 1.2 in the pre-intervention period to 6.5 +/- 1.5/1000 device-days in the post-intervention period (mean difference 6 .7""; 95% CI: 2.9–10.4, P=0.02). A multidisciplinary training program targeted at ICU staff can successfully reduce incidence rates of VAP.

A randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a patient, a healthcare provider, and a systems intervention on the prevalence of risk factors for lower extremity amputation in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. DESIGN: Blinded, randomized, controlled study. SETTING: Academic general practitioner practice. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 395 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes who underwent the initial patient assessment, 352 completed the study. INTERVENTION: The 12-month intervention was diverse. Patients received foot care training and entered into a behavioral contract for desired foot self-care, which was reinforced by telephone and postcard reminders. Healthcare providers received practice guidelines and informative flowcharts on foot-related risk factors for diabetic amputation. In addition, the folders for intervention patients had special markings that prompted healthcare providers to: 1) ask patients to remove their shoes, 2) perform foot exams, and 3) provide foot care training. RESULTS: Patients who received the intervention were less likely than control patients to have severe foot lesions (baseline prevalence: 2.9%; odds ratio: 0.41 [95% CI: 0.16 to 1.00]; P = 0.05) and other dermatological abnormalities. They were more likely to report appropriate self-care behaviors, to be evaluated at doctor visits (68% vs. 28%; P<0.001), and to receive foot care training from healthcare providers (42% vs. 0.001). 18%; P<0.001). Physicians assigned to intervention patients were more likely than physicians assigned to control patients to examine patients' feet for ulcers, pulse, and abnormal dermatological conditions and referred patients to the foot clinic (10.6% vs. 5.0%; "" P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: An intervention aimed at reducing risk factors for lower extremity amputations had a positive impact on patients' self-care behaviors and foot care by healthcare providers, and reduced the prevalence of clinical lower extremity disorders in patients with diabetes.",0,0,
1558,Referral to fertility preservation counseling in cancer patients,"STUDY QUESTION: What changes can be seen over time in fertility preservation (FPC) counseling and what are the determinants associated with the referral of newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 0-39 years to a reproductive medicine specialist for FPC? SUMMARY ANSWER: Although the absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time, only 9.8% of all potential patients (aged 0-39 years) were referred in 2011 and differences in referral have been identified factors related to patient age, cancer diagnosis, and healthcare provider. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Referral rates for FPC prior to initiating gonadotoxic cancer treatment are low. Determinants related to low referral and referral differences have been identified in previous studies, although there is little data on referral practices and determinants of FPC referrals in FP(C)-reimbursing facilities. STUDY DESIGN, SCOPE, DURATION: We conducted a retrospective observational and questionnaire study in a Dutch university hospital. Data were collected on all female cancer patients counseled at this center for FP (2001-2013) and all newly diagnosed female cancer patients aged 0-39 years in the region (2009-2011). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, FACILITIES, METHODS: Data were retrieved from medical records (FPC patients), cancer incidences reported by the Dutch Cancer Registry (to calculate referral percentages), and referring professionals (to identify reasons for current referral behavior). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In 2011, a total of 9.8% of patients were referred to FPC. Patients aged 20-29 years or diagnosed with breast cancer or lymphoma were referred more often than patients under 20 years old or patients diagnosed with other malignancies. The absolute number of patients receiving FPC increased over time. Healthcare provider-related determinants of low referral did not initiate discussion about fertility issues, did not know where to refer a patient for FPC, and did not collaborate with patient associations. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Actual referral rates may vary slightly from our estimate as there may have been patients who did not wish to receive FPC. Sporadically, patients may have been directly referred to other regions or received ovarian transposition without FPC. By excluding skin cancer patients, we underestimated the group of women eligible for FPC since this group also includes melanoma patients who may have received gonadotoxic therapy. WIDER IMPACT OF RESULTS: The low referral rates and referral disparity reported in the current study indicate that there are opportunities to improve referral practices. Future research should focus on the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve referral practice, such as B. Educational materials for patients in oncology departments, discussion ideas or methods to raise awareness of FP techniques and guidelines among physicians and patients.

1562,Rehabilitation of Antisocial Personalities: Treatment through Self-Management Strategies,"Perpetrators with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) are generally assumed to resent psychotherapeutic intervention. Some commentators therefore argue that those with the disorder are better treated in the criminal justice system where, after the introduction of indefinite sentences, the obligation to receive psychological treatment is mandatory with the achievement of parole. In comparison, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence's guidelines on the treatment and management of ASPD recommend that those seeking treatment should be considered for admission to specialized psychiatric hospitals. This is because prison interventions are underfunded and ASPD treatment is given too little priority. The rationale is that offenders with ASPD can be rehabilitated if they are motivated. A problem, however, is that little is known about why offenders with ASPD seek treatment or the impact subsequent treatment has on their self-image. The aim of this paper is to address these unresolved issues. It draws on the findings of a qualitative study funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) that examined the experiences of convicted male offenders admitted to a specialized personality disorders unit within the medium-security estate and of physicians who treat them. The data are analyzed with reference to Michel Foucault's work on governmentality and strategy in power relations. Two arguments are advanced: First, legal coercion motivates offenders with ASPD to use a variety of Foucaultian strategies to create the false impression of treatment progress. Second, and related, the treatment does not lead to changes in the self-image of the resistant patient with ASPD. This assumes that, at least for this group, Foucault was wrong in claiming that resistive behavior merely obscures the effectiveness of treatment norms over time. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that specialist treatment in hospital can bring about changes in the resistance offender's self-image, but not if the completion of treatment leads to his return to prison, as is usual.",0,0,
1563,Rehabilitation of children and young people,"In recent years, a significant increase in most chronic mental and physical illnesses in children and adolescents has been reported. Therefore, the medical rehabilitation of children and young people plays a major role. Therefore, early diagnosis and multimodal intervention in childhood and adolescence are necessary to prevent a chronic progression of the disease. Patient education programs have proven effective in managing chronic conditions. These programs are primarily aimed at improving compliant behavior and disease management. Consequently, the state of health and the quality of life should be improved. The implementation of guidelines and evaluation studies has improved the quality of rehabilitation programs over the past 15 years.

1564,Relapse of Successfully Treated Anxiety and Anxiety: Theoretical Questions and Recommendations for Clinical Practice,"Despite the existence of effective interventions for anxiety disorders, long-term relapse – or return of anxiety – poses a significant problem for patients and clinicians. This paper draws on the experimental and clinical behavioral literature and examines the mechanisms by which return of anxiety occurs can. The goal of the paper was to create a list of treatment recommendations for clinicians aimed at reducing relapse in successfully treated anxiety disorders. Clinical and experimental literature on the mechanisms of renewal, recovery, spontaneous recovery, and reacquisition are reviewed. These will be linked to the clinical and experimental literature on fear return in successfully treated anxiety. A list of recommendations for reducing the likelihood of recurrence in successfully treated anxiety is presented. This list includes methods for application in the behavioral (exposure) treatment of anxiety disorders aimed at improving clinical outcomes. Despite the significant problem of recurrence in successfully treated anxiety, methods are available to reduce the likelihood of recurrence through renewed anxiety. Clinicians involved in the treatment of anxiety disorders should consider these methods to ensure optimal treatment outcome.",0,0,
1565,Ratio of completeness of health research reporting to journal endorsement of reporting guidelines: systematic review,"OBJECTIVE To assess whether the completeness of health research reporting is related to journal endorsement of reporting guidelines. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Reporting guidelines from a published systematic review and the EQUATOR Network (October 2011). Studies assessing the completeness of reporting against an included reporting guideline (referred to as “reviews”) (1990 to October 2011; follow-up searches January 2012) from searches of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Methodology Register or Scopus, depending on the reporting guideline name STUDY SELECTIONS Reporting guidelines in English, which provided explicit guidelines for reporting, described the guideline development process, and indicated the use of a consensus development process, were included. The CONSORT statement was excluded because assessments of CONSORT compliance had been previously reviewed. English or French language reviews of the included reporting guidelines were eligible if they assessed the completeness of the reporting of studies as the primary intent and the included studies allowed for interesting comparisons (d journals) Abstract and then reviewed as full-text reports. If the eligibility for funding was unclear, the authors of evaluations were contacted; Where necessary, journal websites were consulted for endorsement information. Completeness of reporting of reporting guidelines was analyzed in terms of endorsement per item and, where consistent with the authors' analysis, a mean cumulative score. RESULTS 101 reporting guidelines were included. From 15,249 records found when searching for evaluations, 26 evaluations were identified that assessed completeness of reporting in terms of agreement with nine reporting guidelines. Of these, 13 evaluations could be evaluated, which evaluated seven reporting guidelines (BMJ Economic Checklist, CONSORT for harms, PRISMA, QUOROM, STARD, STRICTA and STROBE). Items of the reporting guideline were assessed by a small number of evaluations. CONCLUSIONS The completeness of reporting of only nine out of 101 health research reporting guidelines (excluding CONSORT) was assessed in terms of journal recognition. Items from seven reporting guidelines were analyzed quantitatively, each through a few evaluations. There is insufficient evidence to determine the relationship between journal endorsement of reporting guidelines and the completeness of coverage of published health research reports. Journal editors and researchers should consider collaborative, prospectively designed, controlled trials to provide more robust evidence.

1566,memory therapy in dementia,"BACKGROUND: Reminiscence therapy (RT) has been defined as the vocal or silent reminiscence of events in a person's life, either alone or with another person or group of people. Typically these are group meetings at least once a week, where participants are encouraged to talk about past events, often aided by tools such as photos, music, objects and videos of the past. There is often little consistent use of psychological therapies in dementia services. A number of these 'therapies' have been enthusiastically received by health practitioners in unstimulating care settings. They were expected to work miracles and their ""failure"" to do so has led to their widespread disuse. A systematic review of the available evidence is important to identify the effectiveness of different therapies. Subsequently, guidelines for their use can be drawn up on a well-founded evidence basis. OBJECTIVES: RT involves groups of older people speaking about past events, supported by tools such as videos, images and archives to communicate and reflect on their life experiences. The aim of the review is to assess the effects of RT in dementia. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, PSYCHLIT, EMBASE, OMNI, BIDS, Dissertation Abstracts International, SIGLE and reference lists of relevant articles up to 1998 and contacted specialists in the field. We also searched relevant websites and searched Aging and Mental Health, The Gerontologist, Journal of Gerontology, Current Opinion in Psychiatry, Current Research in Britain: Social Sciences, British Psychological Society Conference Proceedings and Reminiscence database. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials of RT for dementia in the elderly. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies were included in the review, but only one study with 15 participants had extractable data. The results were not statistically significant for either cognition or behavior. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: No firm conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of RT in dementia. The review stressed the urgent need for more systematic research in this area.",0,0,
1567,"Remission, residual symptoms, and non-response to standard treatment for major depressive disorder in controlled clinical practice","BACKGROUND: Although published guidelines recommend continuing treatment for depression until complete remission of symptoms and recovery of functioning, little is known about how often remission is achieved in usual practice and the reasons for treatment discontinuation when treatment outcome is suboptimal was. METHOD: A naturalistic study design evaluated 1859 patients who received treatment for DSM-III-R major depression in the national provider network of a Managed Behavioral Health Organization (MBHO) between 1995 and 1997. Clinician symptom and impairment ratings were used to classify patients into complete response, partial response, and no response. Performance data were used to characterize treatment and identify comorbid conditions. RESULTS: According to physician assessment, approximately 27% to 39% of patients achieved a complete remission. Comorbidity related to medication and drug use and hospitalizations were more common in patients with partial treatment responses. Only half of the non-responders received a drug test during their treatment. Patient choice was the most common reason for stopping treatment, although almost 40% of clinicians agreed with patients' choices even when symptoms had not improved. CONCLUSION: Although complete response rates were comparable to those seen in antidepressant clinical trials, the results suggest that clinicians may not recommend continuation and maintenance treatment according to best practice guidelines, and that unsuccessful treatment often does not include antidepressants.",0,0,

1570,Report of the NIH Panel on the Definition of Principles of Treatment in HIV Infection*,"Recent research advances have led to a significantly improved understanding of the biology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). With the advent of sensitive tools to monitor HIV replication in infected individuals, the risk of disease progression and death can be accurately assessed and the effectiveness of anti-HIV therapies directly determined. In addition, combinations of newly available, effective antiviral therapies, when used appropriately, can provide sustained suppression of detectable HIV replication rates and circumvent HIV's inherent tendency to generate drug-resistant virus variants. However, as antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has become more effective, it has also become more complex. Familiarity with the latest research advances is required to ensure that newly available therapies are deployed in the most effective ways to improve the health and prolong life of people living with HIV. To help practitioners and those living with HIV quickly make the most of new information about the pathogenesis and treatment of HIV disease, the Office of AIDS Research of the National Institutes of Health sponsored the NIH Panel on the Definition of Therapeutic Principles for HIV Infection. This panel was asked to define key scientific principles that should be used to guide the most effective use of antiretroviral therapy and viral load testing in clinical practice. Based on a detailed review of the most recent data, the panel has identified eleven principles that address issues fundamental to the management of HIV infection. These principles provide the scientific basis for the specific treatment recommendations made by the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV Infection, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J.

1571,Reproductive rights and the medical care system: a plea for a rational health policy,"Recently, there have been many challenges to women's reproductive rights and freedoms: court-ordered cesareans, criminal cases against women for prenatal child abuse, and attempts to restrict the practice of midwifery, home births, and alternative birth centers. In these cases, medicine has been complicit or proactive in attempts to control pregnant women's behavior or health care options. We discuss the role of medicine as a means of social control, the medical reconstruction of problems of a social nature, and the need for a more coherent policy framework to guide medical practices."" PIP: Reproductive issues are very contentious. Women's legal abortion rights continue to be Questioned, women's rights are being pitted against the rights of the fetus, and there are concerns about teenage pregnancy, the appropriate use of reproductive technology, and drug and alcohol use during pregnancy, but little attention has been given to the role of medicine as an actor social control and arbiter of reproductive behavior, medical reconstruction and intervention in problems that are essentially social in nature, or equity and social justice in reproductive health care.The authors discuss these latter issues in the Light historical and recent attempts to control the behavior of pregnant women. In the absence of current reproductive health policy, the medical profession makes arbitrary decisions on individual cases that may or may not reflect patient or community desires. A more coherent policy framework and regulatory mechanisms to guide medical practice are needed. The authors discuss the problem in context, key issues, social discrimination in reproductive health care, choice of services to be delivered, coercion and choice, and reproductive health policies as a solution.",0,0,
1572,Requiring physicians to respond to computerized reminders improves their adherence to screening protocols.,"Objective: Improve compliance with computer-generated reminders for performing fecal occult blood (FOBT) testing, mammography, and cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) testing. DESIGN: Six-month prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: Academic general practice for general internal medicine. Subjects: Thirty-one general internal medicine faculties, 145 resident physicians, and 5,407 patients with scheduled visits who were eligible for any of the three cancer screening protocols. Intervention: Primary care teams of internists and teachers received either routine computer reminders (control) or the same reminders that required them to circle one of four responses: 1) ""Done/ordered today,"" 2) """"Doesn't apply to this patient,"" 3) ""patient refused"" or 4) ""next visit"". p=0.002) and separately with reminders for FOBT (61% vs. 49%, p=0.0007) and mammography (54% vs. 47%, p=0.036), but without cervical Pap (21% vs. 18%, p=0.2) . Intervention residents responded significantly more frequently than control residents to all reminders together and separately to reminders for FOBT and mammography, but not for Pap tests. There was no significant difference between the intervention and control faculty, but the compliance rate for the control faculty was significantly higher than the rate for the control residents for all reminders together and separately for FOBT but not mammography or Pap tests. The effect of the intervention was greatest in patients 70 years of age, with significant results for all tests, collectively and individually, for residents but not for faculty. Intervention physicians found that the reminders were inapplicable 21% of the time (due to insufficient data in electronic medical records) and reported that their patients refused 10% of the time. Conclusions: Requiring physicians to respond to computer-generated reminders improved their compliance with screening protocols, particularly in elderly patients, in whom compliance of control physicians was lowest. However, 100% adherence to cancer screening reminders will not be achievable due to incomplete data and patient refusal.",0,1,

This paper outlines the underlying theory and its application adopted by CLAHRC-NDL as a case study that could be generalized to practice outside of the CLAHRC, compared to alternative implementation models. Discussion Traditional approaches to health research often generate evidence in isolation from the setting in which it is intended to be used. The premise of the CLAHRC-NDL model is that implementation barriers can be overcome when knowledge is co-produced by academic and clinical staff, taking into account the organizational context in which it is intended to be applied. This approach is based on organizational learning theory and recognizes that change is a social and political phenomenon. Evidence is created in real-time, taking full account of the environment in which it is to be implemented. To support this process, senior healthcare professionals are seconded to the CLAHRC as ¡Â®Diffusion FellowsÂ¡Â¯ (DFs) to actively bridge the gap between research and practice by being a full member of both the research team and theirs clinical field are train. To facilitate innovation and embed change in the local health community, existing communities of practice will be enhanced and new ones encouraged on specific topics. Our approach has been adopted by 16 clinical research studies in the areas of mental health, children and adolescents, primary care and stroke rehabilitation. Summary The CLAHRC-NDL implementation model applies organizational learning theory by addressing the social and situational barriers and enablers to implementation and adopting a philosophy of co-production. Two key mechanisms for translating innovation were leveraged: DFs to actively bridge the gap between research and practice, and communities of practice to underpin and sustain improvements in healthcare. The model shows promising results in translating research into practice, which may be transferrable to other health contexts.",0,0,

1578,"Exploring Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals: Protocol of the REACH Study, a Randomized Multisite Wedge Trial","Background The REACH study (Research Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals) will provide evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel cleaning initiative aimed at improving the environmental cleanliness of hospitals. The initiative is an environmental cleaning package with five interdependent, evidence-based components (training, technical, product, audit and communication) to be implemented with environmental service workers to improve hospital cleaning practices. Methods/Design The REACH study will use a randomized controlled step wedge design to test the study intervention, an environmental cleaning package, in 11 Australian hospitals. All study hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own controls, with the analysis of change in each hospital being performed based on the data collected in the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomly assigned to one of 11 intervention time points with staggered start dates in 2016 and an intervention period ranging from 20 to 50 weeks. All sites will complete the study simultaneously in 2017. The inclusion criteria allow for a targeted sampling of both public and private hospitals with patient populations at higher risk for healthcare associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (goal one) is the monthly number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremias (SABs), Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections per 10,000 bed-days. Secondary outcomes for goal one include thoroughness of hospital cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology, bioburden from frequent touching of surfaces after cleaning, and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about environmental cleaning. A cost-benefit analysis determines the second key outcome (goal two): the incremental cost-benefit ratio of implementing the cleaning package. The study uses the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework to support the bespoke implementation of the environmental cleaning package in each hospital. Discussion Findings from the REACH study will contribute to future policy and practice guidance on cleaning the hospital environment.

The use of nurse-initiated humor as a healthcare intervention has both physiological and emotional benefits. Little has been written, however, about another very important aspect of humor, patient-initiated humor. When patients use humor to relieve their feelings of stress, uncertainty, or embarrassment, they are attempting to communicate with their caregiver. This use of humor by patients is not intended to 'take lightly' the situation, but rather to reduce their feelings of dehumanization. Humor is an interactive process of sharing and an important aspect of communication. Patients watch the caregiver for a reaction. An open, accepting answer signals understanding"";"" however, a negative or no response may serve to isolate the patient.

1581,Responding to the health risks of young people in primary care: A cluster randomized study training clinicians in screening and motivational interviewing,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention to implement best-practice guidelines recommending physicians to screen and counsel young people regarding multiple psychosocial risk factors, health risk identification by physicians, and patient risk behaviors in comparison to a didactic seminar on young people's health. DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster-randomized study in which voluntary primary care practices were stratified by zip code advantage or disadvantage and billing type (private, free national healthcare, community health center) and then randomized to either intervention or comparator arms using a computer-generated random sequence. Three months after the intervention, patients from all practices were recruited after the consultation for a computer-assisted telephone interview and followed up three and twelve months later. Researchers who recruited, consented and interviewed patients and patients themselves were masked with referral status; clinicians don't. SETTING: General practices in metropolitan and rural Victoria, Australia their 14-24 year old patients INTERVENTION: This complex intervention was developed using evidence-based practice learning and changing clinical behavior and general practice systems and incorporated best practice approaches motivating risk behavior change in adolescents (nine hours) Health risk screening, use of a screening tool and motivational interviewing; Trained all practice staff (receptionists and clinicians) on youth engagement; providing feedback to clinicians on patient risk data; and two office visits to support new screening and reference resources Comparator clinicians received a didactic educational seminar (three hours) on dedicated youth and health risk screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the patient's report of (1) clinical evidence of at least one of six unhealthy behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, risks of sexually transmitted infections, STIs, unplanned pregnancy, and traffic risks); and (2) change in one or more of the six unhealthy behaviors at three months or at 12 months. Secondary endpoints were likelihood of future visits, trust in physician after exit interview, physician's recognition of emotional distress and anxiety and abuse in relationships, and emotional distress at three and 12 months. Patient acceptance of the screening tool was also described for the intervention arm. Where appropriate, the analyzes were adjusted to the practice location and billing method, gender, age, patient recruitment method, and past health risks. An intention-to-treat analysis approach was used that included a multi-level multiple imputation for missing outcome data. RESULTS: 42 practices were randomly assigned to intervention or comparison arms. Two intervention practices withdrew after pre-training allocation, leaving 19 intervention practices (53 clinicians, 377 patients) and 21 comparator practices (79 clinicians, 524 patients). 69% of patients in both the intervention (260) and comparator (360) arms completed the 12-month follow-up. Intervention physicians discussed more health risks per patient (59.7%) than comparators (52.7%) and were therefore more likely to detect a higher proportion of young people exhibiting at least one of the six unhealthy behaviors (38.4% vs. 26.7%, risk difference [RD] 11.6%, confidence interval [CI] 2.93% to 20.3%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.7, CI 1.1 to 2.5). Patients reported less illicit drug use (RD -6.0, CI -11 to -1.2; OR 0.52, CI 0.28 to 0.96) and a lower risk of STIs (RD -5.4, CI -11 to 0.2, OR 0.66, CI 0.46 to 0.96). ) after three months in the intervention relative to the comparator arm and for an unplanned pregnancy after 12 months (RD -4.4; CI -8.7 to -0.1; ""OR 0.40, CI 0.20 to 0.80 No differences were found between the arms of the other health risks. There were no differences in the secondary endpoints, apart from greater detection of abuse (OR 13.8, CI 1.71 to 111.) There were no reports of adverse events and adolescents in the intervention arm had high acceptance of the screening tool CONCLUSIONS: A complex intervention compared to a simple practices training seminar Better detection of unhealthy behaviors in young people Impact on health outcomes was inconclusive Technology that provides a more efficient, systematic health risk Screening allows providers to target counseling to those at higher risk.

1584,Results of a collaboration between a physician and a respiratory therapist to improve long-term metered dose inhalation technique in a pediatric asthma clinic,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapy, asthma remains the chronic condition most frequently responsible for absenteeism from school and pediatric hospitalizations. This is especially true for inner-city children. We operate a downtown Pediatric Asthma Compliance and Technique (PACT) clinic where physicians and respiratory therapists work together to improve technique and outcomes of metered dose inhalers (MDI) in asthmatic children. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of our strategy in improving MDI technique and asthma outcomes. METHODS: Children referred to the PACT Clinic underwent a standardized assessment based on the guidelines of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) expert panel. Physicians demonstrated and confirmed correct MDI technique at each visit. Using a standardized format, we prospectively collected data at the patient's first visit (T1) and last visit (T2) on demographics, MDI technique scores (MDI steps performed correctly""; ""scale of 0-8), lung function, and severity of asthma (NHLBI classification scale: 1 = mildly intermittent to 4 = severely persistent). Statistical analyzes were performed using parametric and non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients who attended the PACT Clinic between 1999 and 2002, 15 were excluded from the study because of incomplete data collection. The mean duration from T1 to T2 was 11.8 +/- 9.5 months. At T1 and T2, mean MDI technique scores were 53% and 81%, respectively, mean total asthma severity scores were 2.6 and 2.3, and total pulmonary function severity scores were 2.4 and 2 ,1. MDI technique scores improved significantly between TI and T2 (p<0.001). The black patients showed the greatest improvement with the MDI technique (p<0.001), but their pulmonary function test scores, global asthma severity score, and pulmonary function severity score did not improve significantly. The white patients significantly improved both their MDI technique (p=0.004) and their overall asthma severity scores (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: At our PACT clinic, asthmatic children showed sustained improvement with the MDI technique, and some of the patients improved in lung function and total asthma severity score.",0,0,
1585,Results that matter: structured vs. unstructured blood glucose self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes,"Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a part of diabetes management. SMBG presents information about current glycemic status and provides the ability to get instant feedback on the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on glucose levels. However, SMBG is only useful if the glucose information is properly understood, the data is accurately interpreted, and the results lead to appropriate therapeutic measures. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently published guidelines for the use of SMBG in non-insulin-treated people with diabetes and recommends that SMBG should only be used when patients and/or their physicians have the ability and willingness to use SMBG -Include monitoring and therapy adjustment in their diabetes care plan. If SMBG is used, the IDF also recommends that structured SMBG be performed using defined schemes to meet individual needs. Structured SMBG can be performed as daily glucose profiles that are representative of daily glucose variances. Measuring preprandial/postprandial blood glucose (BG) levels on consecutive or alternating days (“pairwise testing”) also provides meaningful glucose information for daily diabetes management. This article reviews recent studies that have appropriately used structured SMBG as an integral part of overall diabetes management and discusses how their results support the IDF recommendations. Our goal is to support physicians in making more informed decisions about the value and usefulness of SMBG in diabetes management.",0,0,
1586,Rethinking Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials: Introducing the Cohort-Multiple Randomized Controlled Trial Design.,"Pragmatic studies are important for routine clinical practice, but current study designs have shortcomings. Clare Relton and colleagues outline the new design of a multi-cohort randomized controlled trial that may help address the issues associated with existing approaches. Randomized controlled trials are generally considered the best Å“gold standard” for determining how well an intervention is working. However, studies that aim to determine the effectiveness of a treatment through a double-blind, placebo-controlled design (i.e., explanatory studies) are sometimes criticized. For example, although the design of explanatory studies leads to strong internal validity, we can rely on the results of a particular study. Such studies may have limited external validity: we cannot be confident that we can apply the results to routine clinical practice. Pragmatic studies1 2 , aiming to inform practice-based healthcare decision-making, have been offered as a solution as they maintain the rigor of randomization (and thus remove selection bias) but retain the characteristics of normal clinical practice. Conducting and interpreting both pragmatic and explanatory randomized controlled trials presents significant problems. This article describes a study design that helps address these issues—the “cohort-multiple randomized controlled trial” approach. Existing clinical trial designs can fail in four areas: recruitment, ethics, patient preferences, and treatment comparisons. ### Recruitment Most randomized controlled trials have difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of patients. For example, one review found that less than a third of 114 multicentre, publicly funded studies in the UK recruited their original target number of patients within the originally specified time.3 Failure to target recruitment can impact the validity and generalizability of study results to have. In addition, many clinical studies exclude hard-to-reach groups and ethnic minorities4, leading to differences between the “need” (reference) population and the study population.5 6 “ ¦",0,0,
1587,Review of legal instruments and codes on medical experimentation involving children,"Medical research involving children is the subject of ongoing debate. The reason for the controversy is clear. As with research involving adults, a balance must be found between two goals – promoting the health of children through advances in scientific knowledge and protecting child subjects from exploitation and harm. However, due to their age and relative immaturity, children cannot protect their own interests as well as adult subjects. But as they approach adulthood, more and more care must be taken to involve children in decisions that affect them, even to the extent that they can make decisions that can have serious and long-term consequences.",0,0,

1593,Richard Cabot: Medical reformer during the progressive era (1890-1920),"Richard Cabot's (1868-1939) decision in 1920 to leave full-time medical practice to teach social ethics illustrates some of the tensions inherent in the 20th-century transformation of medicine from clinical practice to a biomedical science. Cabot, then one of America's best-known physicians, was practicing medicine at a time when science was redefining medical practice and thinking. Although Cabot was a champion of medical science, his main concerns were clinical and humanistic. He emphasized the importance of outpatient medicine, advocated group practice, founded hospital social work, conducted clinical-epidemiological research, advocated preventive medicine, founded the Clinical-Pathological Conference, and wrote extensively on medical ethics. In 1912, despite Cabot's great talent, a top professorship at Harvard Medical School was instead given to David Edsall, a clinician with a broader background in science. However, Cabot's efforts to define the role of the physician as well as the health care system in human well-being anticipated contemporary attempts in medicine to emphasize the social context of the patient.",0,0,

1596,Risk communication in clinical trials: a cognitive experiment and survey,"BACKGROUND: A working group of the Royal Statistical Society recently recommended that in initial human clinical trials ""greater use should be made of numerical rather than verbal risk descriptions"". This reflected the view of many clinicians and psychologists on risk communication. As the clinical trials industry is expanding rapidly worldwide, it is important to understand risk communication in Asian countries. METHODS: We conducted a cognitive experiment on participation in a hypothetical clinical trial of an analgesic and survey among cancer and arthritis patients in Singapore. In part 1 of the experiment, patients received information about the risk of side effects in one of three formats (frequency, percentage and verbal descriptor) and in one of two sequences (least to greatest and highest to least). and asked about their willingness to participate. In part 2, the patients were informed about the risk in all three formats in the same order and asked again about their willingness to participate. This was immediately followed by a survey on preference for risk presentation methods and use of verbal descriptors. Results: The willingness to participate and the probability of changing one's own decision were not influenced by the methods of risk representation. Most patients reported a preference for the frequency format, but those with primary or no formal education were indifferent. While patients used the verbal descriptors 'very often', 'frequently' and 'very rarely' similar to the European Commission guidelines, their use of the descriptors 'uncommon' and 'rarely' differed significantly from the EU. CONCLUSION: In this sample of Asian cancer and arthritis patients, the format of risk presentation did not influence willingness to participate in a clinical trial. However, there is a clear preference for the frequency format. The lay use of verbal descriptors differed significantly from that in the EU.",0,0,
1597,Risk factors for methotrexate-induced lung injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a multicenter case-control study,"BACKGROUND: Toxicity limits the use of methotrexate. AIM: To identify risk factors for methotrexate-induced lung injury in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: One private and five academic rheumatology practices. PARTICIPANTS: Methotrexate recipients with rheumatoid arthritis with and without lung injury. MEASUREMENTS: Potential risk factors evaluated were sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, medical history, clinical and ancillary characteristics, and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis prior to methotrexate therapy, and characteristics of methotrexate therapy. Cases of lung injury were defined using the modified Searles and McKendry criteria. RESULTS: 94% of study participants were white and 67% were women. Case patients (n=29) were older than controls (n=82) (61.5 versus 54.5 years). The strongest predictors of lung injury, after adjusting for other variables, were older age (odds ratio [OR], 5.1 [95% CI, 1.2 to 21.1]), diabetes (OR, 35.6 [CI, 1st .3 to infinity]), rheumatoid pleuropulmonary involvement (OR, 7.1 [CI, 1.1 to 45.4]), prior use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (OR, 5.6 [CI, 1.2 to 27.0 ]) and hypoalbuminemia (OR, 19.5 [CI, 3.5 to 109.7]) . Previous use of disease-modifying anti-inflammatory drugs and hypoalbuminemia had very large attributable risks. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the risk factors that predispose patients with rheumatoid arthritis to the toxic effects of methotrexate on the lungs may provide a rationale for monitoring and facilitating management of high-risk patients.",0,0,
1598,"Risk of inpatient heart failure in new users of saxagliptin, sitagliptin and other antihyperglycaemic drugs","Background: Recent post-marketing studies have provided conflicting results on the risk of in-hospital heart failure (hHF) associated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, creating uncertainty about the safety of these antihyperglycemic agents. Aim: To study the associations of hHF with saxagliptin and sitagliptin. Design: Population-based retrospective cohort study for new users. Framework: 18 health insurance and health systems data partners in the US Food and Drug Administration's Mini-Sentinel program. Patients: Patients 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes who started therapy with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, second-generation sulfonylureas, or long-acting insulin products between 2006 and 2013. Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification Codes 402.x1, 404.x1, 404.x3 and 428.xx recorded as the main discharge diagnosis. RESULTS: 78,553 saxagliptin users and 298,124 sitagliptin users contributed a mean of 7 to 9 months of follow-up data to one or more pairwise comparisons. The risk of hHF was no greater with DPP-4 inhibitors than with the other study drugs. The hazard ratios from the stratified analyzes of disease risk scores (DRS) were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) for saxagliptin versus sitagliptin, 0.63 (CI, 0.47 to 0.85 ) for saxagliptin versus pioglitazone, 0.69 (CI, 0.54 to 0.87) for saxagliptin versus sulfonylureas, and 0.61 (CI, 0.50 to 0.73) for saxagliptin versus insulin. The hazard ratios stratified by DRS were 0.74 (CI 0.64 to 0.85) for sitagliptin versus pioglitazone, 0.86 (CI 0.77 to 0.95) for sitagliptin versus sulfonylureas, and 0.71 (CI 0, 64 to 0.78) for sitagliptin versus insulin. The results of the 1:1 propensity score matched analyzes were similar. Results were also similar in subgroups of patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease and in a subgroup defined by the 2 highest DRS deciles. Limitation: Remaining confounding and short follow-up. Conclusion: In this large cohort study, no increased risk of hHF was observed in users of saxagliptin or sitagliptin compared to other selected antihyperglycemic agents.

1599,Risk prevalence and cancer screening by general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: This study presents the cancer risk prevalence and screening rates of patients who visit primary care physicians. Conditions treated include smoking, skin cancer, Pap smears, clinical breast exams and mammography. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 7,160 patients aged 18-75 years presenting to 230 general practitioners in a metropolitan and rural region of Queensland, Australia was used. Risk prevalence was determined from patients' self-reports of risk behavior and pre-consultation screening. Information on preventive care during the consultation was based on the doctors' self-declaration at the end of the consultation. RESULTS: 27% of men and 23% of women smoked, with rates being highest in the younger age groups. According to national guidelines, prior screening for men and women had not been performed as recommended, as follows: skin cancer screening - 66% of men, 70% of women; cervical cancer screening – 27%; clinical breast examination – 45%; Mammography – 75%. These patients were therefore classified as “at risk” and the screening rates for these patients in the consultation were as follows: smokers – 34%; skin cancer – 5%; cervical cancer – 16%; mammography – 4% ;"" clinical breast examination – 8%. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients presenting to primary care physicians were at risk of developing cancer according to national guidelines. Of these, only small proportions of all groups had preventive intervention by their GP at the consultation identified in this study. While primary care physicians generally recognize their role in prevention as important, these results raise questions for future cancer prevention strategies and primary care physician education.",0,0,
1600,Role and interactions of the cardiologist in a regional institutional project of primary prevention,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence to support policy support for a population-wide approach to ""shifting the distribution of risk factors"", but it is difficult to set up permanent primary prevention projects and to bring together the right experts. METHODS: 1999 The Piedmont Region Administration set up a multi-year intervention with aims to reduce risk factors and increase protective factors for oncological and cardiovascular diseases in the general population, especially in disadvantaged groups.The cardiologists played a major role by supporting the project of evidence guidelines, production of bibliographic reviews and dissemination of coronary risk maps In A core group of trainers has been set up in each local health service to promote a system of lifestyle advice centered on GP work - media campaign with health promotion in newspapers, television, open public transport and notice boards on the following topics: nutrition, high blood pressure, tobacco, physical activity, stress;"" Warehouses, food markets, trains and squares were involved. In addition, since January 2000, a Newsletter Review has been published to provide basic models, the most effective interventions and recommendations for their implementation. RESULTS: GPs were shown a new level of care for primary prevention and counseling arguments, and the need for continuous education to promote preventive measures. A system was developed to identify the best channels, ways of communication and the most effective messages for a healthy lifestyle. A model for monitoring changes in risk factors and protective behavior in the population that describes social differences was developed to better plan and evaluate effective interventions.

1601,"Role of ""external facilitation"" in implementing research results: A qualitative assessment of facilitation experiences in the Veterans Health Administration","Background Facilitation has been identified in the literature as a potential key component for successful implementation. However, it is neither well defined nor well studied. Significant questions remain about the operational definition of facilitation and the relationship of facilitation to other interventions, particularly other change agent roles when used in multi-layered implementation projects. Researchers who are part of the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) are actively investigating various approaches and processes, including facilitation, to enable implementation of best practices in the Veterans Health Administration's healthcare system, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. This paper describes a systematic, retrospective evaluation of implementation-related facilitation experiences within the framework of QUERI, a quality improvement program developed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. Methods A post-hoc evaluation was conducted through a series of semi-structured interviews to explore the concept of facilitation in several multi-site QUERI implementation studies. The interview process is based on a technique developed in the educational field that systematically enhances experiential learning by stimulating the recall and reflection of past complex activities. For data analysis, an iterative content analysis approach was used in relation to a set of conceptually sound interview questions. Results The results suggest that facilitation in the context of an implementation study initiated by a central change agency is a conscious and valued process of interactive problem solving and support that takes place in the context of a recognized need for improvement and a supportive interpersonal relationship. Moderation has been primarily described as a distinct role with a range of potentially critical behaviors and activities. The data further suggest that outside facilitators are likely to use or integrate other implementation interventions while performing this problem-solving and supportive role. Preliminary conclusions This review provides evidence that facilitation could be viewed as an implementation intervention in its own right, in the same way that audit and feedback, education or similar methods are viewed as interventions in their own right. Therefore, moderation should be clearly defined and explicitly evaluated for its perceived benefits within multi-intervention implementation projects. In addition, researchers should better define moderation's specific contribution to the success of implementation in different types of projects, different types of sites, and with evidence and innovations of varying strength and complexity.",0,0,
1602,The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Schizophrenia and Related Disorders,"BACKGROUND: The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists coordinates the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in psychiatry funded under the National Mental Health Strategy (Australia) and the New Zealand Health Funding Authority. This paper presents guidelines for schizophrenia and related disorders. In the last decade, schizophrenia has become more treatable than ever. A new generation of drug therapies, a renaissance in psychological and psychosocial interventions, and a first generation of reforms within the specialized mental health system have all combined to create an evidence-based climate of realistic optimism. Ongoing neuroscientific advances offer the strong possibility of more definitive biological treatments in the near future. However, this improved potential for better outcomes and quality of life for people with schizophrenia has not materialized in Australia. The gap between efficacy and effectiveness is wider in schizophrenia than in any other serious medical disorder. Therapeutic nihilism, under-resourced services and a stalled service reform process, poor morale within specialized mental health services, a lack of broad-based recovery and life support programs, and a climate of persistent stigma and resulting lack of concern for people with schizophrenia are the contributory causes for this failure of effective treatment. Therefore, these guidelines address only one element in the quest to reduce the impact of schizophrenia. They distill the current evidence base and make recommendations based on the best available knowledge. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search (1990-2003) was performed, including all Cochrane schizophrenia reviews and all relevant meta-analyses, and a number of recent international clinical practice guidelines were consulted. A number of drafts were refined by the panel of experts and further developed through a bi-national consultation process. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of schizophrenia by treatment type and disease stage. The key features of the guidelines are: (i) Early detection and comprehensive treatment of first episode cases is a priority, since the psychosocial and possibly biological impact of a disease can be minimized and outcome improved. An optimistic attitude on the part of healthcare workers is an essential part from the start and throughout all phases of the disease. (ii) A comprehensive and sustained intervention should be ensured during the first 3-5 years after diagnosis, since the course of the disease is strongly influenced by the events in this ""critical phase"". Patients should not be required to “prove chronicity” before being granted permanent access to specialized mental health services and employment. (iii) Antipsychotic medication is the cornerstone of treatment. These drugs have improved in terms of quality and tolerability, but should be used more carefully and in a more targeted manner than before. The treatment of choice for most patients is now the novel antipsychotic drugs because of their better tolerability and particularly the reduced risk of tardive dyskinesia. This applies in particular to patients in the first episode, for whom new drugs are the first, second and third choice due to better tolerability. However, these novel agents are themselves associated with potentially serious medium- to long-term side effects for which patients must be carefully monitored. Conventional antipsychotic medications at low doses may still play a role in a small proportion of patients who have achieved complete remission and are well tolerated"";"" however, the indications are increasingly decreasing. These principles are now accepted in most developed countries. (vi) Clozapine should be used early in the course once treatment resistance to at least two antipsychotics has been demonstrated. This usually means an incomplete response to positive symptoms, but clozapine may also be considered when there are pervasive negative symptoms or there is a significant or persistent risk of suicide. (v) Comprehensive psychosocial interventions should be routinely available to all patients and their families and delivered by appropriately trained mental health professionals who can commit to the task. These include family interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy, occupational rehabilitation, and other forms of therapy, particularly for comorbidities such as substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. (vi) The social and cultural environment of people with schizophrenia is a key area of intervention. Adequate housing, financial security, access to meaningful social roles, and the availability of social support are essential components of recovery and quality of life. (vii) Interventions should be carefully tailored to the phase and stage of the disease, as well as gender and cultural background. (viii) Genuine involvement of consumers and families in the development and delivery of services should be standard. (ix) The maintenance of good physical health and the prevention and early treatment of serious medical conditions have been seriously neglected in the management of schizophrenia, leading to premature death and widespread morbidity. The quality of medical care for people with schizophrenia should be in line with general community standards. (x) General practitioners (GPs) should always be closely involved in the care of people with schizophrenia. However, this should be truly shared care, and care provided solely by a GP with minimal or no involvement of specialists, while very common, is not considered an acceptable standard of care. Optimal management of schizophrenia requires a multidisciplinary team approach in which a consultant psychiatrist is central.",0,0,

1604,Evidence-based guidelines from the Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party of the Royal College of Physicians for secondary prevention of stroke through diet or dietary modification,"BACKGROUND: Every year 15 million people worldwide and 110,000 people in England suffer a stroke. Having a stroke increases your risk of having another. There are a number of additional known risk factors that can be modified through diet. The present study aimed to systematically review key nutrients and diets and their role in secondary prevention, and to provide evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice. The work was carried out as part of the process to develop the 4th edition of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) National Clinical Guideline (NCG) for stroke. METHODS: Questions were generated by the research team in consultation with the Virtual Stroke Group, an online professional advocacy group, and the RCP Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party Guideline Development Group. Nine questions on multiple individual nutrient and diet combinations were defined and searched in five electronic databases (Embase, Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library and Web of Science) up to October 31, 2011. All included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Van Tulder criteria for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) criteria for systematic reviews. RESULTS: From 4287 abstracts were identified, 79 articles reviewed, and 29 systematic reviews and RCTs included to provide evidence for the secondary prevention components of the guidelines. Evidence statements, recommendations and practical considerations were developed for each question. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review process has led to the development of evidence-based guidelines for use in clinical practice and identified areas for further research.",0,0,
1605,Saccadic eye movement metrics reflect surgical resident fatigue,"AIM: Little is known about the impact of OR resident fatigue on patient safety. We monitored residents' fatigue status during their visiting day using (1) eye movement metrics, (2) objective measurements of laparoscopic surgical performance, and (3) subjective reports based on standardized questionnaires. BACKGROUND: Previous attempts to study the effects of fatigue on surgical performance suffered from methodological limitations, including inconsistent definitions and lack of objective measures of fatigue and non-standardized measures of surgical performance. Recent research has shown that fatigue can affect the properties of saccadic (rapid ballistic) eye movements in non-surgical scenarios. Here we asked whether duty time (~24 hours)-induced fatigue might affect saccade metrics in surgical residents. Because saccade velocity is not under voluntary control, a saccade velocity-based fatigue index has the potential to provide an accurate and unbiased measure of the occupant's fatigue level. METHODS: We measured the eye movements of members of the resident general surgery team at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ) (6 males and 6 females) with a head-mounted video eye tracker (similar configuration to a surgical headlight). ), while performing 3 tasks: 2 simulated laparoscopic surgical tasks (peg transfer and precision cutting) and a guided saccade task, before and after their day of deployment. Residents rated their perceived fatigue every 3 hours during their 24-hour shift using a standardized scale. RESULTS: Length of service decreased saccade velocity and increased subjective fatigue, but had no effect on laparoscopic performance. These results support the hypothesis that saccadic indices reflect graded changes in fatigue. They also point out that fatigue due to longer hours of service does not necessarily lead to medical errors, highlighting the complicated relationship between continuity of care, patient safety and fatigued providers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time that saccade velocity is a reliable indicator of the subjective fatigue of healthcare professionals during extended shifts. These results have potential implications for the development of neuroergonomic tools to detect fatigue in healthcare professionals and for the specifications of future policies related to residents' working hours.",0,0,
1606,Security risks associated with the lack of integration and connectivity of hospital health information technologies: a qualitative study of hospital e-prescribing systems in England,"Background Significant sums of money are being invested in health information technology worldwide. However, realizing benefits and mitigating security risks depends heavily on the effective integration of information into systems and/or interfaces to enable cross-system information sharing. As part of an English research program, we examined the social and technical challenges related to the integration and connection of hospitals that have already had initial experiences with stand-alone and hospital-wide multi-modular integrated electronic prescribing systems (ePrescribing). Methods We collected qualitative longitudinal data from six hospitals, which we designed as case studies. We conducted 173 interviews with users, implementers, and software vendors (up to three different times), 24 system usage observations and strategy meetings, 17 implementation plan documents, and 2 full-day expert discussions. The data were first analyzed within and then across cases thematically, using perspectives around information infrastructures. Results We found that integration and interface issues impeded effective information transfer in both standalone and multi-modular systems, leading to a patient safety threat arising from the unavailability of timely information and duplicate data entry. On some standalone systems, where users had to deal with multiple logins, interface problems arose immediately that did not alleviate over time. At first glance, multi-modular systems seemed to avoid such problems. However, with these systems there was a perceived lack of data coherence between the modules, leading to challenges in presenting a comprehensive view of the patient record, possibly due to the piecemeal implementation of modules with different functionalities. Although it was possible to access data from some primary care systems, we found that poor bi-directional transmission of data between hospitals and primary care required bypasses, which in turn led to the possibility of new errors associated with duplicate and manual information transmission . Extending eRescribing to modules containing other clinically important information needed to support care was still an aspiration at most sites, although some advanced multi-module systems had begun to implement this functionality. However, multi-modular systems were considered difficult to interface with external systems. Conclusions The decision to pursue a strategy of buying standalone systems and then connecting them, or to pursue a strategy of buying hospital-wide multi-modular systems is crucial for hospitals to realize the vision of a fully integrated digital record, and on that should be based a clear appreciation of the relative trade-offs between these choices. While multi-modular systems offered slightly better usability, standalone systems offered greater flexibility and opportunities for innovation, especially in terms of interoperability with external systems and in terms of adaptability to the needs of different user groups.",0,0,
1607,"Salivary cortisol response after a medical interview: the impact of physician communication behavior, depressive affect, and alexithymia","OBJECTIVE: To study whether—and possibly how—a medical interview can affect adrenal cortical activity in pain patients with and without alexithymia. METHODS: Female patients (N=54) recruited from a fibromyalgia patient organization completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and subgroups with low and high scores were selected for participation. Seven physicians conducted consultations in which they tried to vary their communication according to the given guidelines. All consultations were videotaped and analyzed by the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) to assess the actual content of the consultations. RESULTS: An increase in depressive affects from before to after the interview was associated with relatively high cortisol levels 24 h after the interview, but only in patients with alexithymia. Immediately after the interview, psychosocial questions from the doctor were associated with an increased depressive mood, but at no time with cortisol reactions. CONCLUSION: In patients with impaired affect regulation, an increase in depressive affect after a medical consultation may be associated with delayed effects of adrenal cortical activity, possibly mediated by rumination. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Providers should be sensitive to potential affect regulation deficits in their patients.",0,0,

We propose and discuss whether focus group setting, compared to questionnaire surveys, encourages participants to exaggerate views in a negative direction. DISCUSSION: Based on an example from our own research in which we conducted a survey as a follow-up to a focus group study, and referring to theoretical approaches and empirical evidence from the literature on survey participant behavior and small group dynamics, we discuss the possibility that a discrepancy in the results between the focus groups and the questionnaire reflect characteristics of the two different research methods. In contrast to the survey, the focus group study showed that physicians were generally hostile to clinical guidelines. We were not convinced that this difference in results was due to methodological flaws in any of the studies, and instead discuss how this difference might have been the result of a general methodological phenomenon. SUMMARY: Based on studies of how poll questionnaires affect responses, it seems reasonable to suggest that polls are more likely to find overly positive opinions. Conversely, there is some evidence in the literature that focus groups can lead to complaints and overly negative attitudes, but this is still an open question. We point out that problematic issues tend to be under-communicated in questionnaire surveys, but may be over-emphasised in focus groups. We argue that it is important to improve our understanding of focus group methodology, e.g. In addition, more experimental research on focus groups should be conducted to advance the methodology and test our hypothesis.",0,0,
1610,School-based mental health intervention for children affected by political violence in Indonesia,"Context Little is known about the effectiveness of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflict in low- and middle-income settings. Mental health problems in children are difficult to manage in situations of persistent poverty and political instability. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based intervention for conflict-exposed children delivered in a low-income setting. Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster-randomized study of 495 children (81.4% inclusion rate) with a mean age (SD) of 9.9 (1.3) years attended randomly selected schools in political violence-affected communities in Poso, Indonesia and were compared to a control group on the waiting list for exposure (=1 event), post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety symptoms. Between March and December 2006, an unblinded assessment took place before, 1 week after and 6 months after treatment. Intervention Fifteen sessions over 5 weeks of a manual, school-based group intervention, including trauma processing activities, cooperative play and creativity - expressive elements implemented by locally trained paraprofessionals. Main Outcome Measures We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale, Depression Self-Rating Scale, Self-Report for Anxiety Related Disorders 5-item version, and Children's Hope Scale, and assessed functional impairment as treatment outcomes using standardized symptom checklists and locally developed rating scales. Results Adjusted for grouping of participants within schools, we found significantly greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (mean difference in change, 2.78 inches; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and sustained hope (mean difference in change, -2.21; 95% CI, -3.52 to -0.91) in treatment group versus waitlist, changes in traumatic expression (stress-related physical symptoms) (mean difference in change, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.12 to 1.11), depressive symptoms (mean difference in change, 0.70; 95% CI, -0.08 to 1.49), anxiety (mean difference in change, 0.12; 95% CI , -0.31 to 0.56) and functioning (mean difference in change, 0.52; 95% CI). , -0.43 to 1.46) did not differ between the treatment and waiting list groups. Conclusions In this study of children in violence-affected communities, a school-based intervention reduced post-traumatic stress symptoms and helped maintain hope, but did not reduce traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or functional impairment.",0,0,
1611,"Screening and brief intervention for obesity in primary care: a parallel, two-arm, randomized study","BACKGROUND: Obesity is a common cause of noncommunicable diseases. Guidelines recommend that physicians conduct screening through referral to behavioral weight loss programs and provide brief advice to motivate weight loss. However, doctors rarely intervene and no studies have been conducted on the subject. We conducted this study to determine whether brief physician intervention is acceptable and effective for reducing body weight in obese patients. METHODS: In this parallel, two-arm, randomized study, patients consulting 137 GPs in England were evaluated for obesity. Individuals who were at least 18 years old, had a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2 (or at least 25 kg/m2 for Asians) and an increased body fat percentage could be included. At the end of the consultation, the physician randomly (1:1) assigned participants to one of two 30-second interventions. Randomization was performed via prepared randomization cards, marked with a code representing assignment, placed in opaque, sealed envelopes and given to physicians to open at the time of treatment assignment. In the active intervention, the physician offered a referral to a weight management group (12 sessions of 1 hour each, once a week), and if the referral was accepted, the physician arranged for the patient to schedule an appointment and offered follow-up care . At the control intervention, the doctor advised the patient that their health would benefit from weight loss. The primary endpoint was weight change at 12 months in the intention-to-treat population blinded to treatment allocation. We also assessed how patients feel when they talk about their weight when they have visited their GP for other reasons. Given the nature of the intervention, we did not expect any adverse events in the usual sense, so safety results were not assessed. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry under number ISRCTN26563137. RESULTS: Between June 4, 2013 and December 23, 2014, we studied 8403 patients, of whom 2728 (32%) were obese. Of these obese patients, 2256 (83%) consented to participate and 1882 were eligible, enrolled and included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 940 individuals in the support group and 942 individuals in the counseling group. 722 (77%) subjects assigned to the supportive intervention agreed to participate in the weight management group, and 379 (40%) of these subjects participated, compared with 82 (9%) subjects assigned to the counseling intervention. In the overall study population, the mean weight change at 12 months was 2.43 kg for the supportive intervention and 1.04 kg for the advisory intervention, an adjusted difference of 1.43 kg (95% CI 0.89-1.97) results. The patients' reactions to the brief interventions of the general practitioners did not differ significantly between the study groups with regard to appropriateness (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.07, p=0.21) or helpfulness (1.05, 0.89–1.26, p=0.54)"";"" Overall, four (<1%) patients considered their intervention inappropriate and unhelpful, and 1530 (81%) patients considered it appropriate and helpful. INTERPRETATION: A behavioral, very brief, opportunistic intervention administered by the physician is acceptable to patients and an effective means of reducing the mean weight of the population.

1612,"Screening and intervention for comorbid substance use disorders, PTSD, depression, and suicide: A trauma center survey","OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined screening and intervention procedures for comorbid substance use and mental disorders in trauma centers in the United States, although these disorders are endemic among survivors of traumatic injuries. In 2006, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) mandated that Level I and Level II trauma centers be screened for alcohol use problems and that Level I centers provide brief interventions for those who tested positive. The ACS is expected to recommend best practice guidelines for screening for substance use problems and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined screening and intervention procedures for the full spectrum of comorbid mental and substance use disorders in US trauma centers. METHODS: Respondents from all Level I and II trauma centers in the United States (N=518) were asked to participate in a survey describing screening and intervention procedures for alcohol and drug use problems, suicidality, depression, and PTSD. RESULTS: There were 391 (75%) respondents. Over 80% of trauma centers are routinely screened for alcohol and drug use problems. Routine assessments and interventions for suicidality, depression, and PTSD were significantly less frequent"";"" in fact, only 7% of centers reported routine screening for PTSD. Consistent with ACS policy, Level I centers were significantly more likely than Level II centers to offer alcohol interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol screening and interventions were common in US trauma centers and appeared to be responsive to ACS mandates. In the future, efforts to orchestrate clinical investigations and guidelines could improve screening and intervention procedures for common comorbid mental disorders.",0,0,
1613,Screening and interventions for obesity in children and adolescents: statement of recommendations,"The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of nongovernmental prevention and primary care experts that systematically reviews evidence of efficacy and develops recommendations for clinical preventive services. This recommendation addresses the evidence for the accuracy of screening children and adolescents for BMI, the effectiveness of behavioral and pharmacologic interventions in improving health outcomes in these children, and the potential harms of routine screening and interventions. Using USPSTF methodology, an analytical framework with key questions was developed to guide the systematic review that serves as the basis for this recommendation. The number of overweight children and young people has more than doubled in the last 25 years. Obesity in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased health risks. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral counseling or other preventive interventions in overweight children and adolescents that can be delivered in primary care settings. Currently available studies are limited by factors such as small sample sizes, poor generalizability, and variable follow-up. Based on this critical gap in efficacy evidence, the USPSTF concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine obesity screening in children and adolescents as a means of preventing adverse health outcomes (“I ""-Recommendation). There are several gaps in research on screening and interventions for overweight children and adolescents in primary care. Research is needed to provide well-defined and effective approaches to medical and psychological assessment in children, as well as effective clinical approaches to the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity that can be implemented by primary care physicians.",0,0,
1614,Screening for and treatment of suicidal risk relevant to primary care: A systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"Background: In 2009, 36,897 deaths in the United States were caused by suicide. Purpose: To review the accuracy of screening tools and the effectiveness and safety of screening and treatment for suicide risk in populations and settings relevant to primary care. Data sources: Citations from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL (2002 to July 17, 2012); gray literature; and a surveillance search of MEDLINE for additional screening studies (July to December 2012). Study selection: English-speaking Studies of reasonable or good quality that assessed the accuracy of screening tools in primary care or similar populations and studies of suicide prevention interventions in primary care or mental health care Data extraction: one researcher extracted data, a second checked the abstraction, two researchers assessed the Study quality. Data synthesis: The evidence was insufficient to determine the benefits of screening in primary care;"" Very limited evidence did not identify any serious harm. Minimal evidence suggests that screening tools can identify some adults at increased risk of suicide in primary care, but accuracy has been lower in studies of older adults. Minimal evidence, limited to high-risk populations, suggested poor performance of screening tools in adolescents. Study results showed that psychotherapy reduced suicide attempts in high-risk adults but not in adolescents. Most studies were not sufficiently powered to detect effects on deaths. Limitation: Evidence of treatment was derived from high-risk rather than screening-detected populations. Evidence relevant to adolescents, older adults, and racial or ethnic minorities was limited. Conclusion: Primary care Feasible screening tools could help identify some adults at increased risk of suicide, but have limited ability to detect suicide risk in adolescents. Psychotherapy can reduce suicide attempts in some high-risk adults, but effective interventions for high-risk adolescents have not yet been established.

1616,Colorectal cancer screening at the forefront,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess primary care physician knowledge, beliefs, and practices related to colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: We surveyed 77 primary care physicians at six central Massachusetts clinics to assess several factors associated with colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: Most agreed with the guidelines for fecal occult blood testing (97%) and sigmoidoscopy (87%), which were generally reported as standard practice. Although the majority (86%) recommended colonoscopy as a screening test for colorectal cancer, it was rarely reported as standard practice. Additionally, 36% considered barium enema an option for colorectal cancer screening, and it was rarely reported as a common practice. Despite a lack of evidence of efficacy, digital rectal exams and fecal occult blood testing have been reported as common practice. However, these were mostly reported in combination with a guideline-compliant test option. Although only 10% reported that stool/home occult blood testing was frequently denied, 60% reported that sigmoidoscopy was performed. Commonly cited barriers for patients to sigmoidoscopy compliance included fears that the procedure might hurt and that patients assume symptoms will occur when there is a problem. Perceptions of healthcare system barriers to sigmoidoscopy were less strong. CONCLUSIONS: Most providers recommended guideline-compliant colorectal cancer screening. However, patients often refused sigmoidoscopy. Results indicate that multiple levels of intervention, including patient and provider education and system strategies, may help increase prevalence.",0,0,
1617,Screening for dementia in primary care: A summary of the evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a major and growing problem, but it is often not diagnosed in its early stages. Screening and earlier treatment could reduce the burden of this syndrome. PURPOSE: To review the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for and early treatment of dementia. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Experts and Bibliographies of Reviews. STUDY SELECTION: The authors developed eight key questions that represent a logical chain between screening and improved health outcomes, along with eligibility criteria for admissible evidence for each question. Permissible evidence was obtained by searching the data sources. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers abstracted relevant information using standardized abstraction forms and graded item quality according to US Preventive Services Task Force criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: No randomized controlled trial of screening for dementia has been completed. Brief screening tools can detect some individuals with early dementia (positive predictive value < or = 50%). Six to 12 months of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors modestly slows the decline in cognitive and global clinical change scores in some patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Function is minimally affected, and fewer than 20% of patients stop taking cholinesterase inhibitors because of side effects. Only limited evidence suggests that any other pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention slows regression in individuals with early dementia. Although intensive caregiving interventions with multiple components can delay the placement of patients in nursing homes with caregivers, the relevance of this finding for those who do not already have caregivers is uncertain. Other potential benefits and harms of screening have not been studied. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tests can detect undiagnosed dementia. In people with mild to moderate clinically proven Alzheimer's disease, cholinesterase inhibitors are somewhat effective in slowing cognitive decline. The effect of cholinesterase inhibitors or other treatments on people with dementia identified through screening is uncertain.",0,0,
1618,Screening for depression in adult patients in primary care: A systematic review of the evidence,"Background: In primary care, major depressive disorder prevalence estimates range from 5% to 13% for all adults, with lower estimates for those aged 55 and over (6% to 9%). In 2002, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended screening adults for depression in clinical practices that have systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. Purpose: To conduct a focused, updated systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force on the benefits and harms of screening adult patients for primary care depression, the benefits of treating depression in older adults, and the harms of treating depression with antidepressants. Data sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, PsycINFO (1998 to 2007), expert suggestions and bibliographies of recent systematic reviews. Study selection: Randomized clinical studies of adequate to good quality or controlled clinical studies""; systematic reviews; meta-analyses;"" and large observational studies of serious adverse events and premature discontinuation due to adverse events. All studies were published in English. Data Extraction: Two investigators abstracted, critically appraised, and synthesized 33 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Data Synthesis: Nine studies of reasonable or good quality indicate that depression screening in primary care and care management programs with staff support, such as case management or involvement of mental health specialists, can improve depression response and remission. Benefit was not evident in screening programs without support from depression care staff. Seven regulatory reviews or meta-analyses and 3 large cohort studies indicate no increased risk of completed suicide with antidepressant treatment. The risk of suicidal behavior was increased in young adults (aged 18 to 29 years) who were taking antidepressants, particularly those taking paroxetine, but was reduced in older adults. Limitation: The examination of harms was limited to serious adverse events and mainly existing systematic reviews were used. Additional studies published from 2007 to 2008 expand this overview. Conclusion: Depression screening programs without substantial support from staff-assisted depression treatments are unlikely to improve depression outcomes. Close monitoring of all adult patients starting antidepressant treatment, particularly those younger than 30 years of age, is important both for safety and to ensure optimal treatment.",0,0,
1619,Screening for high blood pressure,"Purpose: To review the evidence on four questions on screening asymptomatic adults for arterial hypertension: Is hypertension a significant health problem? Can it be detected at an early, pre-symptomatic stage? Is a treatment available and effective? Do the benefits of screening outweigh the costs and risks? DATA IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION: We performed a computerized search of the MEDLARS database to identify community-based trials of drug therapy for mild hypertension"";"" other relevant citations are included where appropriate. Data Synthesis: We approached the preliminary questions in our analysis through narrative review and reasoning. Estimates of therapeutic efficacy are based on previously published meta-analyses. The cost-effectiveness of screening was assessed through formal mathematical modeling of the effect of screening on different US populations. Results of the Analysis: Hypertension is clearly a significant health problem. It can be detected early and effective treatment is available. Screening asymptomatic adults for hypertension has advantages that compare favorably to the risks and costs involved. We estimate that screening is most cost-effective for older adults compared to younger adults and for men compared to women, and is very sensitive to the cost of therapy for mild hypertension. Conclusions: We recommend screening for hypertension in all adults. We also discuss the frequency and scope of screening activities. When low-cost therapy is used, the cost-effectiveness of screening for hypertension compares favorably with other cardiovascular interventions.",0,0,
1620,Screening for postnatal depression in primary care: cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine screening for postnatal depression in primary care. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision model of alternative methods for screening for depression, including standardized postnatal depression and generic depression instruments. The performance of screening instruments was derived from a systematic review and a bivariate meta-analysis on a set of instrument cut-offs"";"" Estimates of other relevant parameters were derived from literature sources and relevant databases. A decision tree considered the entire treatment pathway from the possible onset of postnatal depression through identification, treatment and possible relapse. SETTING Basic care. PARTICIPANTS A hypothetical population of women screened for postnatal depression either through routine treatment alone or supplemented by the use of formal identification methods six weeks after delivery, as recommended by the latest guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Costs expressed in 2006-7 prices and impact on health outcomes expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The time horizon of the analysis was one year. RESULTS Routine use of postnatal or general depression questionnaires did not appear to be cost-effective compared to routine care alone. The Edinburgh Scale for Postnatal Depression (at an intercept of 16) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £41,103 per QALY compared to routine care alone. The ICER for all other strategies ranged from £49,928 to £272,463 per QALY compared to routine care alone, while the probability that no formal identification strategy was cost-effective was 88% (59%) at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000 (£30,000). per QALY. While the sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost of treating misidentified depression (false positive result) was an important driver of the model, formal identification approaches did not appear to be cost-effective given any feasible estimate of these costs. CONCLUSIONS Formal methods of identifying postnatal depression do not appear to offer good value for money for the NHS. The main driver of cost effectiveness appears to be the potential additional cost of treating women who have been misdiagnosed as depressed. Formal identification methods for postnatal depression currently do not meet the National Screening Committee's criteria for adoption of a screening strategy as part of national health policy.",0,0,
1621,Screening for Speech and Language Delay in Preschool Children: Systematic Review of the Evidence for the US Preventive Services Task Force,"BACKGROUND: PEDIATRICS (ISSN numbers: Print, 0031-4005"";"" Online, 1098-4275). Released into the public domain by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Speech and language development is a useful indicator of a child's overall development and cognitive abilities and is related to academic success. Identifying children at risk for developmental delays or related problems can lead to intervention services and family support from an early age when the chances of improvement are best. However, optimal methods for screening for speech and language delay have not been identified, and screening is inconsistently practiced in primary care. PURPOSE: We sought to assess the strengths and limitations of the evidence about the effectiveness of screening and interventions for speech and language delay in preschool children, to determine the balance between benefits and side effects of routine screening in primary care for guideline development US Task Force on Preventive Services. The target population includes all children up to the age of 5 years with no prior history of speech and language delays, such as B. Hearing and neurological impairments. METHODS: Studies were identified from the Medline, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (1966 to November 19, 2004), systematic reviews, reference lists, and experts. The evidence review included only English-language published articles available through libraries. Only randomized controlled trials were considered to examine the effectiveness of interventions. Outcome measures were included if collected at any time point or at any age after screening and/or the intervention, as long as the initial assessment was made while the child was or =2 screening techniques in 1 population and comparisons of a single screening technique absent across different populations. Fourteen randomized controlled intervention trials of good and fair quality reported significantly improved speech and language outcomes compared to control groups. Improvements were demonstrated in multiple areas, including articulation, phonology, expressive language, receptive language, lexical acquisition, and syntax in children across all age groups studied and in multiple therapeutic settings. Improvements in other functional outcomes such as socialization skills, self-esteem, and improved play themes were demonstrated in some, but not all, of the 4 studies that measured them. In general, intervention studies have been small and heterogeneous, may be subject to plateau effects, and have reported short-term outcomes based on different tools and measures. As a result, long-term outcomes are unknown, interventions could not be compared directly, and generalizability is questionable. CONCLUSIONS: The use of risk factors to guide selective screening is not supported by studies. Several aspects of screening have been insufficiently studied to determine optimal methods, including which instrument to use, the age at which to screen, and what interval is most useful. Intervention trials show improvement in some outcome measures, but conclusions and generalizability are limited. No data are available addressing other important issues, including the effectiveness of screening in primary care, the role of increased surveillance by primary care physicians prior to referral for diagnostic evaluation, non-speech and language, and the long-term benefit of interventions and side effects of screening and interventions.",0,0,
1622,Screening Surgeons for HIV Infection: A Cost-Benefit Analysis,"OBJECTIVE. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a strategy to screen surgeons for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to prevent transmission of HIV to patients undergoing invasive procedures. DESIGN: Cost-Benefit Analysis. RESULTS: A one-time national screening program would identify approximately 137 surgeons with HIV infection (range 28 to 423 surgeons) and prevent approximately 4.3 infections (range 1.9 to 21.3 infections) in patients treated by infected surgeons treated, and 0.9 infections (range , 0 to 12.9 infections) in sexual partners of infected surgeons with direct costs of US$8.1 million and induced costs of approximately US$44 million. It would result in expenditure of US$458,000 per life year saved (range US$147,000 to US$687,000 per life year saved), while an annual screening program would result in expenditure of approximately US$1.1 million per life year saved (range $338,000 to $1,886,000). year of life saved). If the prevalence of HIV infection among surgeons is estimated to be three times our base case estimate (an increase from 0.1% to 0.3%), annual screening would result in expenditure of approximately $741,000 per life year saved. If the probability of seroconversion after a patient is exposed to a contaminated instrument is increased from our base case estimate of 0.29% to 5.0%, an annual screening program would still cost more than $228,000 per life year saved costs. CONCLUSION: Screening surgeons for HIV to prevent transmission of HIV to patients undergoing invasive procedures requires expenditure per life year saved that is significantly higher than most accepted health interventions. Surveillance studies in patients treated by HIV-infected surgeons should be continued to confirm that transmission of HIV to patients undergoing invasive procedures is rare.",0,1,
1623,"Screening, Isolation, and Decolonization Strategies in the Control of Meticillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Intensive Care Units: Evaluation of Cost-Effectiveness","OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening, isolation, and decolonization strategies in the control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units. DESIGN Economic evaluation based on a dynamic transmission model. SETTING England and Wales. Population Theoretical patient population in an intensive care unit. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Infections, deaths, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for alternative strategies, and net financial benefit. RESULTS All decolonization strategies improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Although universal decolonization (regardless of MRSA status) was the most cost-effective in the short term, strategies that use screening to target MRSA carriers may be preferred due to the lower risk of resistance selection. Among these targeted strategies, universal intake and weekly polymerase chain reaction screening coupled with decolonization with nasal mupirocin was the most cost-effective. This result was robust to the size of the ICU, the prevalence of MRSA on admission, the proportion of patients classified as high-risk, and the exact value of willingness to pay for healthcare. All strategies that used isolation but not decolonization improved health outcomes, but increased costs. If the prevalence of MRSA on ICU admission was 5% and the willingness to pay per QALY gained was between £20,000 ($23,000; $32,000) and £30,000, the best such strategy was to isolate only those patients who had a are at high risk of carrying MRSA (either pre-emptively or after identification by admission and weekly screening for MRSA using chromogenic agar). Universal enrollment and weekly screening using polymerase chain reaction-based detection of MRSA in conjunction with isolation were unlikely to be cost effective unless the prevalence was high (10% of patients at enrollment were with MRSA colonized). CONCLUSIONS MRSA control strategies using decolonization are likely to be cost-effective in an ICU provided resistance is absent, and the combination of universal polymerase chain reaction screening with decolonization is likely to represent good value for money when untargeted decolonization is considered unacceptable. In intensive care units that do not undergo decolonization, there is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for MRSA outside of high-prevalence settings.",0,0,
1624,Secondary prevention after mild strokes and TIA - standard care and development of an accompanying program,"BACKGROUND: Effective methods of secondary prevention after stroke or TIA are available, but adherence to recommended evidence-based treatments is often poor. The aim of the study was to determine the quality of secondary prevention in standard care and to develop a step-by-step modeled support program. METHODS: Two consecutive cohorts of acute mild stroke or TIA patients undergoing usual outpatient care were compared to a secondary prevention program. Risk factor control and medication adherence were assessed in 6-month follow-ups (6M-FU). The usual care consisted of detailed information on targets for vascular risk factors at discharge and regular outpatient care by general practitioners. The step-by-step modeled care program also included up to four outpatient appointments. A combination of educational and behavioral strategies was used. RESULTS: 168 patients in the observation cohort who reported willingness to participate in a prevention program (mean age 64.7 years, admission blood pressure (BP): 155/84 mmHg) and 173 patients participating in the support program (mean age 67.6 years, blood pressure : 161/84 mmHg) were assessed after 6 months. The proportions of patients with BP according to guidelines were 50% in usual care and 77% in the support program (p<0.01). LDL < 100 mg/dl was measured in 62 versus 71% (p = 0.12). The proportion of patients who quit smoking was 50 versus 79% (p<0.01). 72 versus 89% of patients with atrial fibrillation received oral anticoagulation (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factor control remains unsatisfactory in current treatment. Secondary prevention goals were more frequently achieved within the supervised cohort. The effects on the (cerebro)vascular recurrence rates are examined in a multicenter randomized study.",0,0,

DESIGN Pragmatic, randomized, controlled superiority study. SETTING 6 ambulances in Manchester and Cambridge. PARTICIPANTS 208 adolescents aged 11-17 years with moderate to severe severe or probably severe depression who had failed a brief initial intervention. Adolescents with suicidal tendencies, depressive psychosis or behavioral disorders were included. INTERVENTIONS 103 adolescents received an SSRI and routine treatment"";"" 105 received an SSRI, routine care, and CBT. The study lasted 12 weeks, followed by a 16-week maintenance phase. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change from baseline in the Health of the Nation Child and Adolescent Outcome Scale (primary outcome) score with 12 weeks as the primary and 28 weeks as the follow-up endpoint. Secondary measures were the change in scores on the Mood and Emotion Questionnaire, the Revised Child Depression Rating Scale, the Child Global Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale. RESULTS At 12 weeks, the treatment effect for the primary endpoint was -0.64 (95% confidence interval -2.54 to 1.26, P=0.50). In a longitudinal analysis, there was no difference in treatment efficacy for the primary (mean treatment effect 0.001, -1.52 to 1.52, P=0.99) or secondary endpoints. Thoughts of suicide and self-harm decreased on average. There was no evidence of a protective effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on suicidal thinking or acting. After 28 weeks, 57% had improved greatly or very much, and 20% remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS For adolescents with moderate to severe major depression, there is no evidence that the combination of CBT plus an SSRI in the presence of routine clinical care contributes to an improved outcome at 28 weeks compared to the provision of routine clinical care plus an SSRI alone .

1628,Self-Help Books for Depression: How Can Practitioners and Patients Make the Right Choices?,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common and important public health problem, most often treated by primary care physicians. A self-help approach is popular with patients, but little is known about its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to review and update the evidence for the clinical efficacy of bibliotherapy in the treatment of depression. Our secondary goal was to identify which of these self-help materials are commonly available and to examine the evidence specific to these publications. METHOD: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CCTR, PsiTri, and the National Research Register were searched for randomized trials evaluating self-help books for depression that included participants over 16 years of age with a diagnosis or symptoms of depression. Clinical symptoms, quality of life, cost or user acceptability were the required outcome measures. Papers were independently obtained and data extracted by two researchers. A meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed using the mean and standard deviation of the Hamilton rating scale for depression at the study endpoint. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were identified. None met CONSORT guidelines and all were small, with the largest study having 40 patients per group. Nine of these evaluated two recent publications, Managing Anxiety and Depression (UK) and Feeling Good (US). A meta-analysis of 6 studies evaluating Feeling Good found a large treatment effect compared to delayed treatment (standardized mean difference = -1.36""; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.76 to -0.96). Five Self-help books were identified as available and were widely purchased by members of the public, in addition to the two books evaluated in trials.CONCLUSION: There are a number of self-help books on treating depression that are readily available.For the majority, there are hardly any direct evidence of its effectiveness. There is weak evidence that bibliotherapy based on a cognitive behavioral therapy approach is useful for some people when given additional guidance. More work is needed in primary care to assess the cost-effectiveness of self-help and the am examine the most appropriate format and presentation of materials.",0,0,
1629,Self-management programs for COPD: Making progress,"Self-management is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is confusion about which processes are involved, how the value of self-management should be determined, and research priorities. To gain more insight into and consensus on the content of programs, outcomes and future directions of COPD self-management, a group of interested researchers and physicians, all of whom had previously published on the topic and previously worked on other projects, convened a workshop. This article summarizes their initial findings. Self-management programs aim for structural behavior change to maintain treatment effects after the programs are completed. Programs should include behavior modification techniques, be individually tailored, take into account the patient's perspective, and may vary depending on the patient's disease course and comorbidities. The assessment should include process variables. This report is a step towards more self-government compliance. To improve clarity about effectiveness, future studies should clearly describe their intervention, be properly designed and substantiated, and contain results that focus more on the acquisition and practice of new skills. In this way, more evidence and a better understanding of self-management programs will be gained and a more specific formulation of self-management guidelines will be possible.",0,0,
1630,Self-reported use of personal protective equipment among Chinese critical care physicians during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are often treated in intensive care units (ICUs), posing a significant risk of nosocomial transmission to critical care physicians and other patients. Despite a large body of literature and guidelines recommending infection control practices, numerous barriers leading to poor compliance with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been identified in intensive care units. The use of PPE by critical care physicians has not been extensively evaluated, especially during the influenza pandemic. This study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors and barriers to compliance for PPE use among healthcare workers in intensive care units during the influenza pandemic. METHODOLOGY/MAIN RESULTS: A 36-question survey tool was developed and distributed to all medical professionals in 21 intensive care units in 17 provinces in China. A total of 733 doctors, nurses and other professionals were interviewed, of whom 650 (88.7%) were included in the analysis. Fifty-six percent of respondents reported having completed a pandemic influenza education program prior to caring for H1N1 patients, while 77% reported having adequate knowledge of self-protection and patient protection. Only 18% of respondents were able to correctly identify all components of the PPE and 55% reported high compliance (>80%) in using PPE during patient care. In the multivariate analysis, vaccination against the 2009 H1N1 influenza, positive attitudes towards PPE use, organizational factors such as availability of PPE in the ICU and patient information about influenza precautions, and reprimands for non-compliance by supervisors were associated with high compliance, while they were negative Attitudes to PSA use and violation of PSA use were independent predictors of low compliance. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge and self-reported adherence to the recommended use of PPE among Chinese critical care physicians is suboptimal. The perceived barriers should be addressed to close the significant gap between perception and knowledge or behavior.",0,0,

1632,Self-reported violations during medication administration in two children's hospitals,"Content Violations of security protocols are pathways to adverse outcomes that have been inadequately addressed by existing security efforts. This study reports on nurse self-reported violations in the medication administration process. Objective To capture the extent of violations in the medication administration process among nurses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The participants were 199 nurses from two municipal, academic, independent pediatric tertiary care hospitals in the United States who were based in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), a hematology-oncology-transplant unit (HOT), or a medical surgical (Med /Surg) unit. In a cross-sectional survey, nurses were asked about violations in routine or emergency situations at three steps of medication administration. Main Outcome Measures Self-reported violations of three medication administration protocols were assessed using a seven-point scale from 0 to 6 from “not at all” to “very severely”. Results Analysis of variance revealed that reports of violations were highest in emergency situations rather than routine surgeries, highest in HOT ward nurses, followed by ICU nurses and then the med/surgical unit, and highest in verifying patient identification, followed by associating a medication with a medication administration record and then documenting an administration. There was also a significant three-way interaction between injury situation, step in process, and unit. Conclusions Protocol violations occur throughout the medication process and their prevalence varies by hospital unit, step in the process, and injury situation. Further research is needed to determine whether these violations improve or worsen security, and for those that do, how the management system can be redesigned to reduce the need to violate protocol to complete work tasks.",0,0,
1633,Self-study using web-based and printed guides. A randomized controlled trial among general practitioners,"BACKGROUND: Online physician education is increasing, but its effectiveness compared to existing self-study methods is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare knowledge, learning effectiveness, and learner satisfaction produced by self-study of World Wide Web-based and printed guidelines for acute myocardial infarction care. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: 12 residency programs in family medicine and internal medicine at four universities. PARTICIPANTS: 162 residents. INTERVENTIONS: In proctored sessions, participants were randomly assigned to study printed materials or SAGE (Self-Study Acceleration with Graphic Evidence), a web-based tutorial system. Both methods used identical self-assessment questions and answers and guideline text, but SAGE included hyperlinks to specific guideline passages and graphical evidence animations. MEASUREMENTS: Scores on multiple-choice knowledge tests, score gains per unit of study time, and ratings on a learner satisfaction scale. RESULTS: Immediately post-test scores on a 20-point scale were similar in the SAGE and control groups (median 15.0 vs. 14.5 inches; P > 0.2), but SAGE users spent less time spent learning (median 27.0 versus 38.5 minutes; P<0.001) and therefore had higher learning efficiency (median gain 8.6 versus 6.7 points per hour; P=0.04). On a scale of 5 to 20, SAGE users were more satisfied with their learning (median 17.0 compared to 15.0; P<0.001). After 4 to 6 months, knowledge had decreased to the same extent in the SAGE and control groups ( Median, 12.0 compared to 11.0; ""P = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Online tutorials can lead to greater learning efficiency and satisfaction than printed materials, but self-study may be insufficient for long-term knowledge retention. Further research is needed to identify instructional characteristics that motivate better outcome learning and retention.",0,1,
1634,Sertraline as monotherapy for the treatment of psychotic and non-psychotic depression,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective when used alone in the treatment of unipolar depression with psychotic features. The purpose of the present study was to assess the response to sertraline in patients with and without psychotic features using standard criteria such as recovery and remission. METHOD: An 8-week, open-label study of sertraline in depressed hospitalized patients was conducted. Twenty-five subjects had DSM-IV major depressive disorder with psychotic features and 25 had DSM-IV major depressive disorder without psychotic features. After a week of open washout, all subjects were assessed at baseline using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). The HAM-D was administered weekly and the BPRS was not re-administered until the end of the 8-week study. The drug dose was started at 50 mg/day, increased to 100 mg/day after 1 week, and then increased to 200 mg/day if the subjects were not in remission. RESULTS: Depressed patients without psychosis responded significantly better than depressed patients with psychosis using the criteria remission (HAM-D score - 7 inches; p=0.001), response (HAM-D score - 50% of baseline; p = 0.001) used 0.011), referral to electroconvulsive therapy (HAM-D score >/= 15; p = 0.011), or change in HAM-D scores (p = 0.016). The baseline HAM-D score and psychosis independently predicted response, while the baseline BPRS scores did not, regardless of whether psychotic status was included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotic depression is less responsive to sertraline alone than depression without psychosis. Psychosis was a predictor of response, independent of the level of depression and general psychopathology. Limitations due to an open-label design are discussed, as are differences between this study and others using SSRIs for psychotic depression.",0,0,
1635,Services for children with developmental coordination disorder: an assessment using best practice principles,"PURPOSE: The National Health Service in Scotland has published a best practice framework to support Occupational Therapists and Physiotherapists in providing effective services to children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD). However, compliance is variable. To highlight areas of development, this study compared the care pathway within a pediatric DCD service to the NHS Scotland framework. METHODS: A UK-based partnership of researchers and clinicians conducted a qualitative study with 37 participants (N=13 interviewees, N=24 workshop participants). In-depth interviews and/or workshops were used to align DCD service with the NHS framework. Identified gaps were matched against four key phases of the care pathway. Qualitative analysis software was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: For each phase of the path, core principles were identified that should guide future development. These core principles related to the NHS framework and focused on issues such as family involvement, defining clear pathways and encouraging children's participation. Participants identified potential strategies for improving services, such as developing community-based interventions and providing information. CONCLUSION: Challenges in providing services to children with DCD include confusing treatment pathways and poor collaborative partnerships. Therefore, it is important that physicians employ collaborative working strategies that encourage children's participation. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: There are numerous challenges associated with implementing best practice principles in the delivery of therapy services for children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). It is important that AHPs look for ways to involve parents and educators at all stages of the care journey to ensure optimal service delivery for the child. Addressing participation is an important aspect and community-based strategies can be particularly useful, both as a preventive activity and as an intervention approach.",0,0,

1637,"Sex, Stroke, and Inflammation: The Potential for Estrogen-Mediated Immune Protection in Stroke.","Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in developed countries. Experimental and clinical data indicate that stroke is a sexually dimorphic disorder in which males show increased intrinsic susceptibility to ischemic damage throughout most of their lives. The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well known, but estrogen exposure can also be harmful, particularly in older women. The mechanisms for this are still unclear. Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen in relation to neuronal injury, but cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells. Despite estrogen's potent anti-inflammatory effects, few studies have examined estrogen's contribution to sex differences in the inflammatory response to stroke. This review examines the potential role of estrogen-mediated immune protection in ischemic injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,
1638,Sexual activity and counseling in the first month after acute myocardial infarction in younger adults in the United States and Spain: a prospective observational study,"BACKGROUND: United States and European Cardiovascular Society guidelines recommend physicians counseling patients about resuming sexual activity after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but little is known about patients' experiences of counseling about sexual activity after AMI famous. METHODS AND RESULTS: The prospective longitudinal study, Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients (VIRGO), conducted in 127 hospitals in the United States and Spain, was designed in part to address gender differences in sexual baseline to assess activity, function, and patient experience with physician counseling about sexual activity after an AMI. This study used baseline and 1-month data collected from the 2:1 sample of women (N=2349) and men (N=1152) aged 18 to 55 years with AMI. The average age was 48 years. Among those who reported having discussed sexual activity with a doctor in the month after AMI (12% of women, 19% of men), 68% had restrictions imposed: limit sex (35%), adopt a more passive role (26th %), and/or keep heart rate low (23%). In risk-adjusted analyses, factors associated with not discussing sexual activity with a physician included female gender (relative risk 1.07 in; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.11) and age (relative risk 1.05 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval). , 1.02-1.08) and sexual inactivity at baseline (risk ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.15).

METHODS: The authors reviewed relevant articles in journals, medical examinations, and professional association publications to identify learning goals for human sexuality in medical curricula. RESULTS: There is consensus about many of the recruitment goals and some of the skills that sexual health medical students should acquire. There is less consensus about what sexuality-related information medical students need to master. The few common information objectives narrowly focus on the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction and disease. CONCLUSION: The model sexual health curricula, licensing exams, and professional association guidelines focus primarily on the pathological aspects of sexuality. Medical students should master basic information about healthy sexual function and become familiar with the role of practitioners in various therapeutic disciplines in treating sexual concerns and improving sexual function and patient well-being. Classes should also identify ways to incorporate this important topic into time-limited interactions with patients.",0,0,
1640,Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Users of Erectile Dysfunction Drugs: Analysis of Claims Data,"Background Pharmacological treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED) have gained wide popularity among middle-aged and elderly men in recent years. Increased sexual activity among users of these treatments raises concerns about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Objective To study the association between sexually transmitted diseases and ED drugs (see Design Longitudinal Analysis of ED Drug Users and Non-Users of 1,410,806 Male Employees 40+ with Private Insurance from 44 Large Companies <0.005). Adjusted for these baseline rates, ED drug users had higher rates of STDs in the year after first ED drug use compared to non-users over the same period (OR 2.06, p<0.05). In ED drug users, STD rates were higher in the year after first ED drug use than in the year before (327 vs. 289 annually per 100,000 people, p<0.05). Limitations Selection bias precludes firm conclusions about whether use of ED treatments directly results Conclusions Compared to non-users, ED drug users have higher rates of STDs both before starting treatment and one year after. At the very least, this relationship suggests that men taking ED medication may benefit from early discussions about safe sex practices and closer surveillance for STDs. It's also possible that the availability of ED medications may increase STD rates.",0,0,
1641,Shared decision-making does not bias physicians against the guidelines of clinical practice,"BACKGROUND: While shared decision-making (SDM) and adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are important, some believe they are incompatible. This study examined the trade-off between physicians' intent to engage in SDM and their intent to follow guidelines. METHODS: Embedded in a clustered randomized trial evaluating the impact of training physicians in SDM on the use of antibiotics to treat acute respiratory infections, this study assessed physicians' intentions to both engage with SDM and follow guidelines. A self-administered questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior assessed both behavioral intentions and their respective determinants (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) at study entry and exit. We used path analysis to examine the relationships between intents. We performed statistical analyzes using the maximum likelihood method and the variance-covariance matrix. Goodness-of-fit indices included the chi-square statistic, the comparative fit index, and the root mean square error of approximation. RESULTS: We analyzed 244 responses at entry and 236 at exit. In the control group, we observed initially that physicians' intention to engage in SDM (r = 0, t = 0.03) did not affect their intention to follow guidelines; however, their intention to follow guidelines (r = -0.31, t = -2.82) negatively impacted their intention to engage in SDM. Upon exit, no behavioral intent influenced the other. In the experimental group, no behavioral intention influenced the other upon entry;"" Upon exit, intention to engage in SDM still did not influence intention to use CPGs, although intention to adhere to CPGs (r = −0.15 t = -2.02) slightly negatively influenced intent to engage in SDM, but this was not clinically significant.CONCLUSION: Physicians' intent to engage in SDM does not affect their intent to use guidelines even after SDM training Physician intent to adopt guidelines had no clinically significant impact on intent to engage in SDM STUDY REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01116076.",0,0,

1643,Should future interventional neuroradiologists be screened for mutations affecting radiation-induced DNA repair?,"In our current medical practice, more and more medical specialists now have access to radiological technical platforms to perform imaging procedures. Although knowledge of current guidelines and radiation protection equipment is a prerequisite for the use of radiation, the preventive measures are often more or less strictly followed, resulting in chronic daily exposure to significant radiation doses and large cumulative lifetime exposures. In particular, aortic procedures, electrophysiology, and neuroprocedures can result in high doses for operators. Interventionalists might try to justify their denial of exposure risks with various excuses: they don't know where they left their badges (though they would guiltily admit that it's good practice to always wear them), the estimated short duration of the intervention , significant muscle strain and cramps caused by the weight of lead aprons, decreased dexterity with lead gloves, or discomfort when wearing lead goggles. But their dismissive attitude is most likely due to an inherent inability to feel threatened by something they cannot see or feel, a commitment to the patient at all costs, and a culture of bravery that reinforces their behavior.",0,0,

1646,Significance of chronic fatigue syndrome in rehabilitation medicine - status and prospects,"From a clinical perspective, chronic fatigue or fatigue appears to be an important factor in rehabilitation. However, this is first a phenomenon that, according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (JCF), can be described as a function caused by chronic disease or chronic overwork. As part of a workshop at the 12th Rehabilitation Science Colloquium in 2003, the clinical and socio-medical significance of chronic fatigue or exhaustion with regard to rehabilitation was discussed from the perspective of psychiatric rehabilitation, methodology, sociology and practical rehabilitation, and conclusions for future research were drawn . The definition of chronic exhaustion is based primarily on the feeling of chronic fatigue, but also on phenomena such as concentration disorders, physical complaints, headaches and ""drive"" and mood disorders. A psychiatric diagnosis associated with symptoms of chronic fatigue is neurasthenia, which is made according to well-defined criteria. Depressive disorder is one of the most important differential diagnoses in this area. Research by primary care physicians revealed that about 90% of patients diagnosed with a psychovegetative disorder fully agreed with the diagnosis of neurasthenia. Neurasthenia led to phases of inability to work more frequently than somatization disorders and other psychosomatic diagnoses. Based on the ""IRES"" scale ""vital exhaustion"", depending on the individual range of indications, isolated or even serious changes are found in about 50% to 90% of those undergoing rehabilitation. As expected, the majority of the pathological findings affect patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation, since there are overlaps with symptoms of psychosomatic illnesses. However, it is remarkable that even in somatically oriented orthopedic rehabilitation up to 50% of the patients show signs of fatigue. Preliminary studies have shown that these symptoms can definitely be improved as part of rehabilitation, even if there are still plenty of pathological signs to be seen in follow-up examinations. Pronounced manifestations of ""vital exhaustion"" and ""professional exhaustion"" can also be observed in rheumatism patients undergoing somatic rehabilitation. This agrees with the details of the medical history given by many female and male patients. Therefore, it seems necessary to adapt the rehabilitative intervention to both the psychovegetative and the behavioral aspects of this symptom. The scientific classification of the entire field of chronic fatigue with regard to rehabilitation requires a classification of the relevant functions within the framework of the ICF. On the one hand, patient surveys would have to be carried out as part of cross-sectional studies and, on the other hand, a systematic consensus process among experts would have to be used to assign the corresponding functions. This is the basis for the development of suitable assessment instruments for use in prospective studies to systematically evaluate the impact on functions and in particular their impact on activities and participation.",0,0,

It was hypothesized that the intervention group's knowledge and adherence to current HH guidelines might increase after simulation training compared to a control group. METHODS: A prospective, parallel, randomized, controlled, repeated measures study was conducted in a 22-bed adult mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit in Oulu, Finland. Thirty of 40 originally randomized critical care nurses participated in the baseline measurements"";"" 17 of them completed all study procedures. Participants' HH adherence was observed only in high-risk contact situations before and after endotracheal suction events using a direct nonparticipant observation method.

Survey 2 found that almost all in-office nurses (99%) agreed that intervening to stop smoking was part of their role and 95% said they advised patients to quit at least occasionally; A majority (74%) said they recommended NRT to their patients. As with GPs, most in-office nurses thought nicotine replacement therapy was effective (79%) but fewer (42%) thought the cost was justified and only around half (53%) thought it could be available on NHS prescription should. Carers who reported being trained in smoking cessation were more engaged in smoking cessation, had more positive attitudes and were more knowledgeable that smoking was an important part of their role, and a large majority reported that they were at least some smokers have intervened, providing a promising base from which to proceed in terms of implementation of the new smoke. However, there is hope that improvements will be made in terms of frequency of updating records and interventions, and acceptance of the cost-effectiveness of NRT can be achieved as a life-sustaining intervention.",0,0,
1652,Beliefs and behaviors of outpatient oncologists about smoking cessation counseling,"PURPOSE: Many cancer patients continue to smoke after diagnosis, increasing their risk of treatment complications, reduced treatment efficacy, secondary cancers, and reduced survival. Outpatient oncology providers may not use the “teachable moment” of cancer diagnosis to provide smoking cessation support. PROVIDERS AND METHODS: Physicians and middle-care providers (n=74) offering outpatient oncology services completed an online survey on behaviors, beliefs, and perceived barriers to smoking cessation counseling. Ambulatory medical records of 120 patients with breast, lung, head and neck, colon, prostate, and acute leukemia cancer were reviewed to assess current practices for assessing smoking cessation and documenting interventions. RESULTS: Providers reported that they frequently assessed smoking in new patients (82.4% frequently or always), but rates decreased at subsequent visits for both current smokers and recent smokers. Rates of patients quitting smoking were also high (86.5% often or always), but <30% of providers reported often or always offering interventions (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy or other medications, self-help materials) to smoking patients and/or recommendations). Only 30% of providers reported that they frequently or always followed up patients to assess progress towards quitting. Few providers (18.1%) reported a high level of confidence in their ability to counsel smoking patients. The lack of patient motivation was identified as the most important obstacle to smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Although views on the provision of smoking cessation services to smoking patients were generally positive, few providers reported that they often offer interventions beyond cessation counseling. Additional education and clinically based interventions can improve adherence to tobacco cessation guidelines in outpatient oncology.",0,0,
1653,Smoking cessation counseling for pregnant and postpartum women: a survey of community health center providers,"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the performance of smoking cessation counseling providers for low-income pregnant and postpartum women attending community health centers. METHODS: WIC (Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) program staff, obstetricians, and pediatric clinicians at 6 community health centers were asked to complete surveys. Smoking intervention practices (performance), knowledge and attitudes, and organizational facilitators were measured. Factors associated with performance were examined using analysis of variance and regression analysis. RESULTS: Performance scores differed significantly by clinic and provider type. Providers in obstetric clinics had the highest scores and those in pediatric clinics had the lowest scores. Nurses and nutritionists scored higher than other providers. Hospital type, greater knowledge about smoking, older age, and perception of smoking cessation as a priority were independently associated with better counseling performance. CONCLUSIONS: Mean performance scores showed room for improvement in all groups. Low scores for taking steps beyond assessment and advice indicate that the focus needs to be on the support and follow-up steps of national guidance. Providers' own commitment to helping mothers quit smoking was important.",0,0,

1655,Smoking cessation in family medicine: implications of a training program at a regional health education center,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many clinicians have not received adequate smoking cessation training. We examined the effects of a tobacco education program on physician behavior, attitudes, knowledge, and comfort related to smoking cessation. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, primary care physicians and general practice schools completed a pre-test followed by an educational intervention that included presentations on smoking cessation resources, motivational interviewing, and the neurobiology of addiction and pharmacotherapy. After 3 months, participants completed a postintervention survey. The results were analyzed using chi-square tests to examine the effects of training. RESULTS: Thirty-three residents and teachers completed the pre-training survey and 25 completed the post-training survey. After the training, participants were more familiar and familiar with the guidelines for public health clinical practice (P<0.0001). No significant differences were found in the performance of the 5 As (Ask, Counsel, Evaluate, Support, and Agree) or other behaviors including providing support with counseling, cessation plans, resources, or pharmacotherapy. There were no improvements in knowledge of specific intervention plans or attitudes related to smoker identification and counseling. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary tobacco education program increases clinician familiarity and comfort with practice guidelines and may help improve nursing activities that promote a healthy lifestyle. Future research should examine other interventions that have the potential to change practice patterns on a larger scale. Future studies should also evaluate the effect of exercise programs on patient-centred outcomes.",0,0,
1656,Smoking cessation - a central role for physicians,"Doctors are in the unique position of advising smokers to quit because they can consider the various aspects of nicotine addiction. This review provides an overview of interventions for smokers presenting in a primary care setting. The strategies used for smoking cessation counseling differed depending on the patient's willingness to quit. For smokers who do not intend to quit smoking, physicians should educate and educate patients about tobacco use and cessation, particularly by personalizing the benefits of smoking cessation and challenging smokers' beliefs. For dissonant smokers, clinicians should use motivational strategies such as B. Discussing barriers to quitting and their solutions. For smokers who are willing to quit, the doctor should show strong support, help set a date for quitting, prescribe pharmaceutical therapies for nicotine dependence, such as replacement therapy and/or bupropion, with directions for use, and suggest behavioral strategies to prevent relapse.",0,0,
1657,Smoking: can we really make a difference?,"The tremendous health benefits of quitting smoking are now well established. Physicians play a crucial role in motivating smokers and initiating attempts to quit. The mainstay of the National Health Service's smoking cessation strategy should be the routine delivery of brief, opportunistic interventions in primary care, supported by referral to a specialized smoking cessation service. There is an urgent need to significantly increase the number of smokers referred to specialized smoking cessation services by GPs, other members of the primary care team and acute hospital staff, and to improve communication channels between the different agencies. The use of pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy or bupropion) in combination with behavioral support yields higher cessation rates than either component alone and is the most effective way to help smokers quit. Smokers who quit smoking often relapse and therefore need repeated help.",0,0,

A lack of evidence for the personal benefit of incidental findings has hampered clinical guidelines. Our aim was to estimate the personal utility of complex information derived from random genomic findings. METHODS: We used a discrete choice experiment to assess participants' personal utility for the following attributes: disease penetration, disease treatability, disease severity, carrier status, and cost. Study participants were drawn from the Canadian public. We analyzed the data using a mixed logit model. RESULTS: A total of 1200 participants completed our questionnaire (available in English and French). Participants appreciated receiving information about high-penetrance disorders, but did not express a benefit from receiving information about low-penetrance disorders. The mean willingness to pay was $445 (95% confidence interval [CI] $322-$567) for incidental findings in a scenario where physicians returned information about medically treatable conditions with high penetrance, but only 66% of participants (95% CI 63%-71%) indicated that they would choose to receive information in this scenario. On average, participants placed a high priority ($725, 95% CI $600 to $850) on having a choice about what type of findings they would receive, including receiving information about high penetrance, treatable disorders, or receiving Information on high penetrance disorders with or without available treatment. The predicted acceptance of this scenario was 76% (95% CI 72%-79%). INTERPRETATION: Most participants appreciated receiving random results, but personal benefit depended on the type of finding, and not all participants wanted to receive random results, regardless of the potential health implications. These results indicate that to maximize utility, participant-level preferences should influence the decision on whether to return incidental findings.",0,0,

1661,"Socioeconomic Factors, Health Behavior, and Mortality: Results from a Nationally Representative Prospective Study of US Adults","Context.Â¡Âª A prominent hypothesis regarding social inequalities in mortality is that the increased risk among the socioeconomically disadvantaged is largely due to the higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviors among those with lower education and income levels. Aim.Â¡Âª To investigate the extent to which 4 behavioral risk factors (cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and relative body weight) explain the observed association between socioeconomic characteristics and all-cause mortality. Design.Â¡Âª Longitudinal study to examine the impact of education, income, and health behavior on the risk of death over the next 7.5 years. Participant. A nationally representative sample of 3617 adult women and men who participated in the Americans' Changing Lives survey. Main Outcome Measure.Â¡Âª All-cause mortality verified by the National Death Index and death certificate reviews. Results.Â¡Âª Educational differences in mortality were fully explained by the strong association between education and income. Adjusting for age, sex, race, urbanity, and education, the mortality hazard ratio was 3.22 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01–5.16) for the lowest income group and 2.34 (95 % CI, 1.49 -3.67) for middle-income people.

Little is known about the effects of these sources of distortion and variation. Purpose: To summarize the evidence on factors that may bias or discrepant the results of diagnostic accuracy studies. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and BIOSIS, as well as the methodological databases of the Center for Reviews and Dissemination and the Cochrane Collaboration. Method experts for diagnostic tests were contacted. Study selection: Studies examining the effects of bias and variation on measures of test performance were eligible for inclusion, which were reviewed by one reviewer and reviewed by a second reviewer. Discrepancies were clarified in the discussion. Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Data Synthesis: The best documented effects of bias and variation were found for demographic characteristics, disease prevalence and severity, partial verification bias, clinical review bias, and observer and instrument variation. For other sources such as B. biased selection of participants, missing or inappropriate reference standard, different verification bias and review bias, the amount of evidence was limited.

METHODS: A 19-item questionnaire was mailed to participants in a large genomic research consortium 18 months after a baseline survey. We describe the stability of parental attitudes towards (a) sharing genome research results, (b) supporting children in genome research, (c) responsibility of researchers, and (d) responsibility to extended family. We also examine their experience of getting results. RESULTS: Of 170 original participants, 154 (91%) responded. Most participants declared their positive right to receive random genomic research results (85%), even when ameliorating therapy was unknown (85%). Only 3% found it acceptable to delegate the decision to return results to an independent committee. Researchers, accompanied by either a parent (42%) or a doctor (17%), felt a responsibility to communicate research results to children as they grew up. Most participants (74%) indicated that the results should be shared with potentially affected extended families. These results are very similar to those of the baseline survey. All participants who received genomic results would do so again and report actions similar to their expressed attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Parental opinions on genome research remain stable over time.

In an attempt to provide the best possible control of patients with diabetes, we have undertaken an attempt to contribute to the best possible control of patients with diabetes, we have developed a new disease state management system for diabetes called Staded Diabetes Management . (SDM), implemented it in over 100 locations worldwide and developed a computer program to simplify its use. SDM, designed to transform the way we treat patients with diabetes, is based on five principles: (1) community participation in setting treatment guidelines; (2) negotiating goals with patients; (3) reasonable timeframes for therapeutic success; (4) use of flow charts for medical decisions;' and (5) evaluation of the program. SDM is designed to be modified by a community to meet their needs and resources. It encourages GPs to provide better diabetes care with a team approach and to refer patients with diabetes to specialists where appropriate. It has a complete set of materials for communities, individual healthcare providers and patients. SDM has been tested for changes in structure, process and results. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials involving over 500 patients has shown a time-weighted average drop in hemoglobin A1c of 1.7 points (equivalent to a drop in mean blood glucose of approximately 3.5 mM or 60 mg/dL). Preliminary pharmacoeconomic analysis shows lifetime cost savings of over $27,000 per patient.

1666,The standard operating procedure changed the behavior of anesthesiologists in prehospital intensive care: a quality control study,"INTRODUCTION: The ability of standard operating procedures to improve prehospital critical care by changing physician prehospital behavior is uncertain. We report data from a prospective quality control study on the behavioral implications of anesthesiologists in prehospital critical care when implementing a standard operating procedure for prehospital controlled ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anesthesiologists from eight prehospital intensive care teams in the central Denmark region prospectively registered prehospital data on advanced airway management according to the Utstein template. We collected pre-procedure data from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012, implemented the standard surgical procedure on February 1, 2012, and collected post-procedure data from February 1, 2012 to October 31, 2012. We included transported patients of all ages requiring controlled ventilation and treated with out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation or placement of a supraglottic airway device. The aim was to evaluate whether the development and implementation of a standard operating procedure for controlled ventilation during transport could change the behavior of anesthesiologists in prehospital intensive care and thereby increase the use of automated ventilators in these patients. RESULTS: Implementation of a standard surgical procedure increased the overall prevalence of automated ventilator use in transported patients requiring controlled ventilation from 0.40 (0.34-0.47) to 0.74 (0.69-0. 80) with a prevalence ratio of 1.85 (1.57–2.19). (p=0.00). The prevalence of automated ventilator use in transported traumatic brain injury patients requiring controlled ventilation increased from 0.44 (0.26-0.62) to 0.85 (0.62-0.97) with a prevalence ratio of 1.94 (1.26–3.0) (p=0.0039). The prevalence of automated ventilator use in patients transported after recovery of spontaneous circulation from prehospital cardiac arrest increased from 0.39 (0.26-0.48) to 0.69 (0.58-0.78) with a prevalence ratio of 1.79 (1.36–2.35) (p=0.00). ).

1667,Statement on Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI).,"Implementation studies are often poorly reported and indexed, reducing their potential to inform initiatives to improve health services. The Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI) initiative aimed to develop guidelines for transparent and accurate reporting of implementation studies. Based on the results of a systematic review and a consensus-building e-Delphi exercise, an international working group of implementation science experts discussed and agreed on the 27-point StaRI checklist. It asks researchers to describe both the implementation strategy (techniques to encourage implementation of an underused evidence-based intervention) and the effectiveness of the intervention delivered. An accompanying explanation and elaboration document (published in BMJ Open, doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013318) describes each of the points, explains the rationale and provides examples of best reporting practices.

1668,State of the art: beta-blockers and reduction of perioperative cardiac events,This article reviews the current literature on the use of perioperative beta-blockade to reduce cardiac events in the hope that it may provide clinicians with direction or identify gaps in medical knowledge and thus uncover areas that are amenable to future study. The current standard of practice for the use of perioperative beta-blockade in preoperative patients is outlined in the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines. Results regarding risk and benefit of perioperative use of beta-blockers to reduce cardiac events are mixed. More research is needed to support the ACC/AHA recommendations. It is important that the decision to use beta-blockade is made on a case-by-case basis with appropriate risk stratification as part of the criteria.,0,0,
1669,Adhering to minimum standards: Implementing antibiotic stewardship in intensive care medicine,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, antimicrobial stewardship programs are a mandatory part of hospital accreditation. Good documentation surrounding antimicrobial prescribing supports communication and can improve prescribing practices in multi-stakeholder environments. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and implement an intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing practice in a 24-bed intensive care unit in a tertiary adult referral hospital. Methods: We conducted a four-phase (observation, reflection, implementation, evaluation) prospective collaborative before-and-after study on quality improvement. Baseline audits and antimicrobial prescribing surveys identified barriers and enablers to good prescribing practice. A tailored intervention was then implemented over a 6-week period that included a yellow medication card sticker, quarterly educational sessions, and ICU-specific empirical guidelines for antimicrobial prescribing. After implementation, the impact was monitored for 1 year through serial antimicrobial prescribing audits. The primary outcomes were clear documentation of start date, planned stop date or review date, and indication for an antibiotic. These were all considered “minimum standards” for prescribing antimicrobials in the medication record. RESULTS: Improved documentation of the minimum standards specifically addressed by the label (start date (72% to 90%, P<0.001), stop date (16% to 63%, P<0.001), antimicrobial indication documented on medication card (58% to 83%, P<0.01)). Overall, compliance with all three minimum standards (start date, end date, and indication) improved from 41/306 (13%) to 306/492 (63%) (p<0.001). A year after implementation, the yellow badge was firmly established in everyday practice. CONCLUSION: A systematic approach to quality improvement combined with the implementation of a tailored, multifaceted intervention can improve antimicrobial prescribing practice.",0,0,
1670,Stimulant Drugs,"Stimulants are a key element in the treatment of ADHD. Carefully designed studies of stimulants have found substantial improvements in core ADHD behaviors in 65-75% of individuals with ADHD. Most standard stimulants are quickly absorbed, with their behavioral effects appearing within 30 minutes, peaking within one to three hours, and disappearing within five hours. Cans in school are often necessary, despite the risk of ridicule from their peers and additional demands for adult supervision. The mechanism by which stimulants work to reduce hyperactivity is not fully understood, but they improve impulsivity and activity levels. Several controlled evaluations conducted over periods of more than one year show a clear persistence of drug effects over time. A carefully designed treatment program with methylphenidate is more effective in reducing hyperactivity symptoms than an intensive program of behavioral and cognitive interventions. The combination of stimulants with psychosocial interventions in ADHD offers few advantages over medication alone. It is difficult to propose unchallengeable guidelines for practice that would be appropriate anywhere. It is imperative that doctors prescribing stimulants properly monitor the use of the drug and make sure it is not being abused by the child's family, peers, or those dispensing drugs at school. Polypharmacy should only be started by a specialized service, and the combination of methylphenidate and clonidine should be used with caution. Aside from ADHD, stimulants are useful for narcolepsy, resistant depression, and partial syndromes of attention and hyperactivity. Large gaps in knowledge remain"";"" Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics of stimulant effects need further study. Details of stimulant administration regimens appear to have a major impact on the response achieved. Further research needs, if possible in realistic settings, comparison of different forms of combination with psychological interventions, investigation of the effects in groups of children outside the core of school children with typical ADHD: preschool children, adults, those with partial syndromes (e.g. inattention) and those with comorbid diseases.",0,0,

However, little is known about the benefits of knowledge translation interventions for these professionals. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of single- and multi-component knowledge translation interventions in improving knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors of rehabilitation clinicians. METHODS: Systematic review of 7 databases conducted to identify studies evaluating knowledge translation interventions specific to occupational therapists and physical therapists. RESULTS: 12 studies met the selection criteria. For physical therapists, participation in an active multi-component knowledge translation intervention resulted in improved evidence-based knowledge and practice behaviors compared to passive dissemination strategies. These gains did not result in a change in clinician attitudes toward best practices. For occupational therapists, no studies have evaluated the use of multicomponent interventions"";"" Studies on individual interventions indicate limited evidence of efficacy for all outcomes measured. CONCLUSION: While this review suggests the use of active, multicomponent knowledge translation interventions to improve physical therapist knowledge and practice, further research is needed to understand the impact of these strategies on occupational therapists. Serious research gaps remain regarding which knowledge translation strategies positively impact patient outcomes.",0,1,

1674,Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE): Explanation and Elaboration,"Much of medical research is observational. Reporting on observational studies is often of poor quality. Poor reporting hinders the assessment of a study's strengths and weaknesses and the generalizability of its results. Taking empirical evidence and theoretical considerations into account, a group of methodologists, researchers and editors developed the Recommendations for Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE statement consists of a checklist of 22 items related to title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies, and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides authors with guidance on improving the reporting of observational studies and facilitates the critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors, and readers. This explanatory and elaborating document aims to improve the use, understanding and dissemination of the STROBE statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. One or more published examples and, if possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are given for each item. Examples of useful flowcharts are also included.

Stress can cause myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, platelet stimulation, increased blood viscosity from hemoconcentration, and endothelial dysfunction and coronary vasoconstriction in the presence of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Psychosocial risk factors can also lead to the development and clinical consequences of arteriosclerosis. The five most important psychosocial risk factors are: depression, anxiety, personality factors, social isolation and chronic life stress. Various components are responsible for the fact that life events or certain psychosocial factors can lead to a stress reaction.

1676,Stress echocardiography in heart failure,"Echocardiography has the ability to noninvasively examine hemodynamic variables during pharmacologic or exercise stress testing in patients with heart failure. In this review, we describe some important potential applications of stress echocardiography in heart failure patients. In patients with coronary artery disease and chronic LV dysfunction, dobutamine stress echocardiography can discriminate between viable and fibrotic tissue to make appropriate clinical decisions. Exercise testing combined with echocardiographic monitoring is a method to obtain accurate information to assess functional capacity and prognosis. Functional mitral regurgitation is a common finding in patients with dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy, and stress echocardiography in the form of exercise or pharmacologic protocols may be useful to assess mitral regurgitation behavior. It is clinically useful to seek the presence of contractile reserve in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, for example to screen or monitor the presence of latent myocardial dysfunction in patients exposed to cardiotoxic agents. Furthermore, in patients with suspected diastolic heart failure and normal systolic function, stress echocardiography may be able to detect the presence of such dysfunction and determine that it is sufficient to limit exercise tolerance. Finally, in aortic stenosis, dobutamine echocardiography can distinguish severe from non-severe stenoses in patients with low transvalvular gradients and impaired left ventricular function.",0,0,
1677,Structured follow-up by general practitioners after intentional self-poisoning: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the follow-up of patients after intentional self-poisoning (DSP). The aim was to investigate whether structured follow-up care by general practitioners increases content, adherence to therapy, and satisfaction with treatment after discharge from the emergency department. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, blinded assignment study. Five emergency rooms and general practitioners' practices in the catchment area were involved. 202 patients discharged from emergency departments after DSP were assigned. The intervention was a structured follow-up by the GP over a period of 6 months with a minimum of five consultations, accompanied by written guidelines for the GP with suggestions on patient motivation for treatment, assessment of personal problems and suicidal ideation, and availability in the event of a suicide crisis . Outcome measures were data retrieved from the Healthcare Providers Reimbursement Control and Payment Registry (KUHR) and through questionnaires sent to patients and general practitioners. After 3 and 6 months, the frequency and content of family doctor contacts as well as compliance with family doctor consultations and treatments in general were recorded. Satisfaction with the general treatment and with the general practitioner was measured using the EUROPEP scale. RESULTS: Patients in the intervention group received significantly more consultations than the control group (mean 6.7 vs. 4.5 (p = 0.004)). The intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the time their GP took to listen to their personal problems (93.1% vs. 59.4% (p=0.002)) and with the fact that the GP involved them in medical decisions included (87.5% vs. 54.8% (p=0.009)). Overall, the intervention group was significantly more satisfied with the treatment than the control group (79% vs. 51% (p = 0.026)). Conclusions: Guidelines and structured, improved follow-up by the general practitioner after discharge of the DSP patient increased the number of consultations and satisfaction with follow-up in the general practitioner's office. Consistent with previous research, there is still a need for intervention studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01342809. Registered April 18, 2011.",0,0,

This study aimed to evaluate a systems-based approach to help in-hospital smokers quit and to identify implementation barriers. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study followed by qualitative analysis of employee interviews. METHODS: The prospective intervention study evaluated the impact of implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the provision of counseling and pharmacotherapy to smokers admitted to cardiac units on counseling frequency. In addition, a qualitative analysis of staff interviews was conducted to examine the determinants of physician and nurse behavior"";"" This attempted to understand barriers related to motivation, ability, and/or opportunity. RESULTS: A total of 150 smoking patients were included in the study (75 before and 75 after SOP implementation). Before the introduction of SOPs, the proportion of patients who reported receiving cessation counseling from physicians and nurses was 6.7% and 1.3%, respectively. After SOP implementation, these proportions increased to 38.7% (p<0.001) and 2.7% (p=0.56), respectively. The qualitative analysis revealed that lack of motivation, eg role incongruity, seemed to be a major obstacle. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a standard set of smoking cessation procedures was effective for physicians but not for nurses. Analysis of barriers to implementation highlighted lack of motivation, rather than skills or opportunity, as a key factor that needed to be addressed.",0,1,
1679,Study confirms value of STD treatment in curbing HIV transmission,"PIP: An intervention was conducted in the Mwanza region of Tanzania to determine whether improved treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) other than HIV/AIDS in rural health centers and pharmacies could reduce the incidence of new HIV infection. Medical assistants and nurses at six rural health centers have been trained in syndromic treatment for STDs, and health center staff have been encouraged to counsel their patients, offer them condoms and ask for referrals from sexual partners for treatment. The centers received the least expensive effective drugs to treat the major STD syndromes. Health professionals trained as supervisors visited each center every 8 weeks to review medication inventories and patient records, provide refresher training, and ensure adherence to syndrome management guidelines. In addition, a cohort of 1000 adults in the communities served by the six health centers were interviewed and tested for HIV at baseline and 2 years after the intervention was implemented. The number of new cases of HIV infection occurring in the cohort was then compared to that occurring in another cohort selected from communities served by health centers that had not provided improved STD treatment . 11,632 cases of STD were treated at the centers during the 2-year study period. The intervention was found to reduce the number of new HIV infections that occurred during the study period by 42%. This decrease affected both sexes and all age groups, but was particularly evident in women aged 15 to 24 years. Survey results show that the reduction in HIV incidence was the result of improved STD treatment rather than changes in sexual behavior. Preliminary calculations put the cost at around US$300 per HIV infection averted.",0,0,
1680,Study of a new curriculum for electronic communication in specialist practices for general medicine,"Electronic communication between doctors and patients is widespread, but it can pose risks for users – both patients and doctors. Little is known about electronic communication between doctor and patient and even less about electronic communication during residency training. We examined knowledge and practices before and after a controlled test of a novel curriculum teaching email communication with patients using residents and faculty in 16 family medicine residences in the United States. Both faculty and residents demonstrated a lack of knowledge about confidentiality and encryption, little familiarity with published guidelines for doctor-patient email, and failure to comply with documentation requirements prior to curriculum presentation. Post-tests showed a greater improvement in knowledge and appropriate behavior regarding patient-physician emails in the intervention group compared to control centers (mean increase in intervention is 13 points [t = -4.065, P < 0.01], mean Increase in control is 5 points [t=-2.015, P<.05]). Increased uncertainty about the convenience of patient emails among intervention residents is an interesting finding that may reflect increased problem awareness but limited time to take up the issue. Suggestions for the implementation of the curriculum are made.",0,0,
1681,Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial: feasibility and impact of cardiovascular absolute risk assessment in Australian general practice,"BACKGROUND: Although cardiovascular absolute risk assessment (CVAR) has been recommended for use in Australian general practice for a number of years, there remains uncertainty about its implementation and implications. Our work to date has developed a multi-faceted implementation model. This study aims to explore both the feasibility of using this model and the impact of CVAR assessment and management on clinical processes and patient care in general practice. STUDY DESIGN: This cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted in general practices in Sydney and will include general practitioners (GPs), other practice staff and patients aged 45 to 69 years without existing cardiovascular disease. Methods: A total of 32 practices (40 general practitioners) and 1,320 patients are recruited. Randomization is performed at the practice level. The intervention group of GPs will be trained to use a CVAR implementation model, while the control group of GPs will continue with usual care. Study outcomes include clinical processes, patient risks, use of lifestyle interventions, and prescription of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications. Data is collected and analyzed using mixed methods. The study results before and after the intervention are compared, and the two groups are also compared after adjusting for the baseline difference and clustering factors. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first study in Australian general practice and one of the few international studies to assess the impact of implementing CVAR assessment and management. The results of this study will help improve primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and inform guidelines for clinical practice and implementation of other health initiatives.",0,0,
1682,Investigating healthcare deimplementation: an analysis of funded research grants,"Background The study of de-implementation, defined here as the reduction or cessation of use of a healthcare service or practice offered to patients by physicians and healthcare systems, has gained prominence in recent years. De-implementing ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or substandard healthcare services and practices is important to mitigate patient harm, improve care processes, and reduce healthcare costs. A better understanding of the state of the art is required to guide future goals and funding initiatives. To this end, we characterized United States (US) National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded research grants for de-implementation. Methods We used systematic methods to search, identify, and describe de-implementation research grants funded by all 27 NIH institutes and centers (ICs) and AHRQ from fiscal year 2000 to 2017. Eleven keywords and three announcements of funding opportunities were used to search for research grants in the NIH Query, View and Report (QVR) system. Two coders identified eligible grants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A code book was developed, pilot tested and revised prior to coding the full final sample grant applications. Results A total of 1277 grants were identified through the QVR system"";"" 542 remained after removing duplicates. After the multi-stage suitability assessment and the review process, 20 funding applications were coded. Many grants were funded by NIH (n?=?15), fewer by AHRQ, and the majority were funded between FY2015 and 2016 (n?=?11). The grant proposals focused on the de-implementation of a range of health services and practices (e.g. drugs, therapies, screening tests) in different health domains (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular diseases) and care settings (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, schools). The grants suggested using a variety of study designs and research methods (eg, experimental, observational, mixed methods) to achieve study goals. Conclusions Based on the systematic portfolio analysis of NIH and AHRQ-funded research grants over the past 17 years, relatively few have focused on examining the de-implementation of ineffective, unproven, harmful, overused, inappropriate, and/or low-quality health services and practices, offered to patients by healthcare practitioners and systems. Strategies for profiling and expanding the research field de-implementation will be discussed.",0,0,
1683,Success after treatment of a periprosthetic joint infection: a Delphi-based international multidisciplinary consensus,"BACKGROUND: The lack of agreement on what constitutes successful treatment of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) makes it difficult to compare the different treatment strategies used in clinical practice and research studies. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to establish a consensus definition of post-PJI treatment success and to provide a universal, multidimensional framework for reporting of PJI treatment trials. METHODS: A basic two-round Delphi method was used to reach a consensus definition. We invited 159 international experts (orthopaedists, infectious disease specialists and clinical researchers) from 17 countries to participate.” 59 participated in the first round and 42 in the second round. The final definition consisted of all statements that achieved strong agreement (80% or more of participants considered a criterion relevant to the definition of success.) RESULTS: The consensus definition of successfully treated PJI is: (1) infection clearance, characterized by one cured wound without fistulas, drainage or pain and no infection Recurrence caused by same strain; (2) no subsequent surgical intervention for infection after reimplantation surgery;"" and (3) no incidence of PJI-related mortality (from causes such as sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis). The Delphi Panel agreed to define intermediate-term outcomes as those reported 5 or more years after definitive PJI surgery, and long-term outcomes as those reported 10 or more years after surgery Although no consensus was reached on the definition of short-term outcomes, 71% of participants agreed that 2 years after definitive PJI surgery is acceptable to define it.CONCLUSIONS: This multidimensional definition of success after PJI treatment can be used to report and compare outcomes of treatment of this catastrophic complication.Level of Evidence: Level V, Therapeutic Study See Author's Guidelines for a full description level of evidence.",0,0,
1684,"Successful implementation of a guideline through peer comparisons, education and positive medical feedback","The aim of this study was to determine whether peer comparisons, an educational intervention, and positive physician feedback would reduce the ordering of knee radiographs. We prospectively evaluated the scheduling of knee radiography for patients with knee injuries before and after an educational program to promote the use of the Ottawa decision rule for knee radiography. Physicians could privately compare their individual baseline X-ray usage data to that of their colleagues. Although acceptance of the rule was voluntary, both oral and written feedback encouraged consideration of the rule in clinical decision-making. The percentage of knee injury patients who received X-rays and the percentage of abnormal results (PAR, defined as the percentage of X-rays showing a fracture or effusion) were calculated before and after the training event. The results of the study showed that the percentage of patients with knee injuries who received X-rays decreased by 23%. In addition, the PAR increased by 58.4% between the two study periods. In summary, the physician's behavior can be positively changed through reinforcement. Peer comparisons, education, and positive feedback from physicians reduced physician ordering of tests, even without mandating the use of a protocol. PAR is a useful outcome measure for tracking physician utilization.",0,1,
1685,Successful implementation of a neonatal pain and sedation protocol on 2 NICUs,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a neonatal pain and sedation protocol in 2 intensive care units. METHODS: The intervention began with an assessment of local practice, problems, and staff satisfaction. We then developed and implemented the Vienna Protocol for Neonatal Pain and Sedation. The protocol included well-defined strategies for both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, based on periodic assessment of a translated version of the Neonatal Pain Agitation and Sedation Scale and titration of analgesic and sedative therapy according to target values. Healthcare workers were trained in assessment using video-based tutorial and bedside instruction. In addition, we carried out reassessments, retraining and random quality checks. Frequency and quality of assessments, pharmacologic therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation, and outcome were compared between baseline (12 months before implementation) and 12 months after implementation. RESULTS: Cumulative median (interquartile range) opiate dose (baseline dose of 1.4 [0.5-5.9] mg/kg versus intervention group dose of 2.7 [0.4-57] mg/kg morphine equivalents”; p=0.002), pharmacological interventions per episode of continuous sedation/analgesia (4 [2-10] vs. 6 [2-13]; p=0.005) and overall staff satisfaction (doctors: 31% vs. 89%; p<0.001; nurses: 17% vs 55%;"" P < 0.001) increased after implementation. Duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in ICU, and side effects were similar before and after implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a neonatal pain and sedation protocol in 2 ICUs resulted in increases in opiate prescription, pharmacologic interventions, and staff satisfaction without compromising time on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and adverse outcomes.",0,0,
1686,Successful reduction of catheter-related UTIs: Focus on nurse-led catheter removal.,"Background Despite sterile catheter insertion, closed drainage systems and structured day care, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) occur regularly in acute care hospitals. We believe that a significant reduction in CAUTI rates can only be achieved by reducing urinary catheter use. METHODS: We used an interventional study of a hospital-wide, multidisciplinary program to reduce the use of urinary catheters and CAUTIs across all patient care units in a 300-bed community teaching hospital in Connecticut. Our primary focus was to implement a caregiver-led urinary catheter removal protocol. This protocol was linked to the physician's order for catheter insertion. Three additional elements included physician documentation of catheter insertion criteria, a device-specific charting module added to the physician's electronic progress notes, and bi-weekly unit-specific feedback on catheter utilization rates and CAUTI rates in a multidisciplinary forum. Results We achieved a 50% reduction in catheter usage and a 70% reduction in hospital-wide CAUTIs over a 36-month period, although there was wide ward-to-ward variation in catheter reduction efforts, ranging from 4% (maternity) up to 74% ranged (telemetry). Conclusion Urinary catheter use, and ultimately CAUTI rates, can be effectively reduced through the careful application of relatively less evidence-based interventions. Aggressive implementation of the nurse-led catheter removal protocol was associated with lower catheter usage rates and reduced infection rates.",0,1,
1687,Suicidality: what to do in an emergency,"Emergency physicians (EP), paramedics, and emergency room personnel play an increasingly important role in the medical and psychological emergency care of patients after suicide attempts, as well as in the crisis intervention of persons with acute suicidal tendencies. This article aims to provide an overview of prevalence rates, methods of suicide or attempted suicide, and the problems faced by EPs in treating these patients. In addition, concepts are presented that enable an adequate risk assessment of suicidal tendencies and the possibilities of a primary crisis intervention. Paramedics and intensive care physicians are increasingly confronted with this complex process with social, personal and medical aspects. In order to treat people in suicidal crises and/or after a suicide attempt and to provide this often heterogeneous patient group with safe and optimal care, clear guidelines are a prerequisite. The initial assessment of the acute risk of suicide is of particular importance due to the resulting consequences and a clear procedure for dealing with people at risk of suicide is shown. In addition, the legal basis is presented.",0,0,
1688,Diagnostics of suicide and violence in psychiatry,"Psychiatrists are increasingly expected to predict and prevent their clients' suicidal and violent/homicidal impulses. This article provides an overview of the current literature and research in these areas. While debate continues as to whether the clinician can successfully predict either violence or suicidal behavior in their patients, the vast majority of studies suggest that predicting suicide and violence in the individual may not be possible given current knowledge. To compensate for prognostic limitations, conservative clinicians deliberately overpredict suicide or violence to ensure the safety of their patients and the larger communities in which they live. In addition, clinicians must conduct thorough assessments and make logical clinical decisions consistent with perceived risks. Preventive measures for violence remain complex, but clinicians can maximize treatment effects by following specific intervention guidelines. At a minimum, documentation of violence must focus on the reasons why treatment interventions were or were not implemented. The diagram does not require lengthy notations, but should include an appropriate risk assessment and description of a prudent course of action.",0,0,
1689,Summary of practice parameters for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with suicidal behavior,"These guidelines review what is known about the epidemiology, causes, management and prevention of suicide and suicide attempts in young people. Detailed guidelines are provided for the assessment and emergency management of children and adolescents with suicidal behavior. The guidelines also include suggestions on how the clinician can interact with the community. Crisis hotlines, method limitations, educational programs, and screening/case finding strategies for suicide prevention are explored, and media counseling is provided to the clinician. Community intervention after a suicide, minimizing contagion or suicide mimicry, and training primary care physicians and other gatekeepers to identify and refer children and adolescents who are potentially suicidal are discussed.",0,0,
1690,Supporting clinical practice at the bedside with wireless technology.,"Objectives: Despite studies showing improvements in both standards of care and outcomes with prudent application of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), their clinical application remains low. This randomized controlled trial evaluated physicians' use of a wirelessly networked mobile computer (MC) at the bedside with access to an emergency room information system, decision support tools (DSTs), and other software options. METHODS: Using a matched-pair design, each of ten emergency physician volunteers was randomized to work five shifts in standard mode (desktop computer [DC] access) and five shifts with a wirelessly networked MC. Work pattern issues and electronic CPG/DST usage were compared using end-of-shift satisfaction questionnaires and review of a CPG/DST database. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to examine differences between the shifts. Results: A total of 100 8-hour shifts were evaluated; 99% compliance with post-shift questionnaires was achieved. Using a 7-point Likert scale (MC scores first), MCs were rated as equally fast (5.04 vs. 4.54; S=0.13) and practical (5.08 vs. 4.14; p=0.07) than DCs Overall, physicians rated MCs as less efficient (3.18 vs. 4.30; p=0.02) but encouraged more frequent use of DSTs (4.10 vs. 3.47 ; p=0.03) with no impact on doctor-patient communication (2.78 vs. 2.96; p=0.51) During the study period, use of an intranet web application (eCPG) by physicians during shifts assigned to the MC more frequently than DC during the study period (eCPG use/shift, 3.6 vs. 2.0;"" p=0.033). Conclusions: MC technology enabled physicians to access information at the bedside and increased use of CPG/DST tools According to physicians, patients seemed to accept their use of information technology to support decision-making The development of improved computer technology can address the main limitation of MC portability.",0,1,
1691,Supporting insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes in primary care: results from the Stepping Up pragmatic cluster randomized controlled clinical trial,"Aim: To compare the efficacy of a novel treatment model (""Stepping Up"") to usual primary care in normalizing insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes, resulting in improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Establishment of primary care practices in Victoria, Australia, with a practicing nurse and at least one consenting eligible patient (HbA1c 7.5% at maximum oral treatment). Participants: 266 patients with type 2 diabetes and 74 practices (mean cluster size 4 (range 1-8) patients), followed up for 12 months. Intervention The Stepping Up model of nursing intervention involved theory-based practice systems change and reorientation of the roles of health professionals in the primary care diabetes team. The core components were an enhanced role for the office nurse in directing insulin initiation and the provision of care by a registered nurse with diabetes education qualifications. Key Outcome Measures The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants who switched to insulin, the proportion who achieved target HbA1c and a change in depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), diabetes-specific burden (problem areas in diabetes scale, PAID) and overall health status (Assessment of Quality of Life Instrument, AQoL-8D). Results: HbA1c improved in both arms, with a clinically significant difference between arms (mean difference -0.6%, 95% confidence interval -0.9% to -0.3%), favoring the procedure. At 12 months, 105/151 (70%) of participants in intervention practices had started insulin compared to 25/115 (22%) in control practices (odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence interval 4.5 to 15.4, P< 0.001) . Target HbA1c (Ä7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%) intervention participants and 22 (19%) control participants (odds ratio 2.2, 1.2 to 4.3, P=0.02 ) . Depressive symptoms did not worsen at 12 months (PHQ-9: -1.1 (3.5) vs. -0.1 (2.9), P=0.05). A statistically significant difference in the mean change in mental health was found between the arms (summary mental AQoL component: 0.04 (SD 0.16) vs -0.002 (0.13), mean difference 0.04 (95 % confidence interval 0.002 to 0.08), p=0.04) favoring intervention but no significant difference in physical health (summary physical AQoL component: 0.03 (0.15) vs 0.02 ( 0.13)) or diabetes-specific burden (5.6 (15.5) vs. No major hypoglycemic events were reported. Conclusions The stepping-up care model was consistent with increased insulin initiation rates in primary care and improvements in glycated hemoglobin without worsening the related to emotional well-being.",0,0,
1692,Supporting middle management health workers in Malawi: Lessons learned from the implementation of the PALM PLUS package,"BACKGROUND: The Government of Malawi is committed to the widespread uptake of antiretroviral treatment in Malawi in the public health sector”; However, one of the biggest challenges was the lack of trained health workers. The Practical Approach to Lung Health Plus HIV/AIDS in Malawi (PALM PLUS) package is an innovative guideline and training intervention designed to support mid-level primary care health workers to deliver integrated frontline primary care. The purpose of this document is to describe the lessons learned from the implementation of the PALM PLUS package. METHODS: A clinical tool based on algorithm- and symptom-based guidelines was adapted to the Malawian context. A companion training program based on outreach education principles was developed and a cascaded training approach was used for the implementation of the PALM PLUS package in 30 health centers, targeting clinical staff, medical assistants and nurses. Lessons learned were identified during program implementation through collaboration with collaborators and program participants and reviewing the results of the program evaluation. RESULTS: Key learnings for successful program implementation of the PALM PLUS package include the importance of building networks for peer-based support, ensuring adequate training capacity, linking it with accreditation for continuous professional development, and providing modest budgets for in-service training courses The main limiting factors for implementation were staff turnover and the desire for financial training allowances. CONCLUSIONS: The PALM PLUS approach is a potential model to support mid-level health professionals in delivering integrated primary care at the front line in low- and middle-income countries and may be useful for future task shifting initiatives.",0,0,
1693,Surgical decision making and behavior. Social psychological explanations and research perspectives,"Social psychology is the discipline that studies thought processes, emotions, and behaviors in an interpersonal context. There are three broad themes: understanding yourself and others, interpersonal relationships, and group influence. The most important method is the experiment. The importance of the socio-psychological perspective becomes clear based on the following surgical research questions: How do surgeons come to their decisions? How do surgeons confirm their decisions? Why do decision-making aids (computer support, guidelines) find so little acceptance? How should patients be informed? Which group processes play a role in the OR? What are the determinants of patient outcomes? Social psychology can enhance surgical research in three ways: better understanding of everyday phenomena in the clinical and surgical field, methodologically refined and more patient-oriented study designs, and new perspectives for improved patient outcomes.",0,0,
1694,Surgical treatments for men with benign prostate enlargement: cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE To determine which surgical treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms indicative of benign prostate enlargement is cost effective. DESIGN Treatment pathways that describe credible treatment strategies were established by consensus. The cost-benefit analysis used Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. DATA SOURCES Clinical efficacy data are derived from a systematic review and an individual level data set. Values in use come from previous economic evaluations. Costs were calculated from the National Health Service (NHS) and commercial sources. METHODS The Markov model included parameters with associated uncertainty measures that describe health states that individuals might move between at three-month intervals over 10 years. Consecutive annual cohorts of 25,000 men were entered into the model and the likelihood that treatment strategies were cost-effective was assessed using a 10,000 iteration Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS A treatment strategy of initial diathermy vaporization of the prostate, followed by endoscopic holmium laser enucleation of the prostate in the absence of benefit or subsequent relapse, was cost-effective with an 85% probability at a willingness-to-pay of £20,000 ( 21,595, $28,686)/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Other strategies using diathermy vaporization as first line treatment have generally been cheaper and more effective than the current standard of transurethral resection, repeated once if necessary. The use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser vaporization was more expensive and less effective than transurethral resection, and strategies that included initial minimally invasive treatment with microwave thermotherapy were not cost effective. The results were not changed by extensive sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION The outcome of this economic model should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the data used. The finding that initial vaporization followed by holmium laser enucleation at failure or relapse could be beneficial for both men with lower urinary tract symptoms and healthcare providers requires confirmation in a high-quality prospective clinical study before any change of current practice. Laser vaporization of potassium titanyl phosphate was unlikely to be cost effective in our model, which argues against its full use until further evidence of efficacy and cost reduction is available.",0,0,
1695,Surrogate decisions for severely cognitively impaired research topics: the ongoing debate,"As research into Alzheimer's disease and other dementia conditions becomes more complex, risky, invasive, and mundane, the need for a discussion about the ethics of including people with dementia in research, particularly research with more than minimal risk and no anticipated direct involvement, intensifies use the topic. (It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the ethical issues related to the research participation of children with cognitive impairments or children or adults with intermittent and/or reversible cognitive or psychiatric impairments. For such discussions see the references in Notes 1– 6.) Reviewing such studies pushes our traditional analytical tools to their limits. Simply weighing and prioritizing the basic ethical principles of respect for the person, benevolence, and justice, which serve us well in reviewing the vast majority of studies, is insufficient when research is being conducted on such ethical complexities as studies with significant risks and reviewed without expectation of direct benefit to the subjects will not be able to consent or withdraw. Going down to the level of theory and placing these principles within the commonly applied framework of consequentialism, deontology, or virtue ethics, we come to learn about reducing the tensions that such research creates between upholding individual autonomy and advancing societal needs , how to treat and cure, these devastating diseases arise, no step closer. What is needed is the introduction of more contemporary moral analysis. In particular, we need to be more inclusive of the diverse value perspectives of our citizenry. In more theoretical terms, we should elevate a communitarian perspective and feminist ethics, with emphasis on relationships and context, to a more central role as we rush to ethically keep up with this fast-growing area of medical research.",0,0,
1696,Survivor care plans and adherence to lifestyle recommendations in breast cancer survivors,"PURPOSE: The effectiveness of survivor care plans has not been extensively tested. We evaluated whether a one-time brief lifestyle counseling as part of a broader treatment plan for survivors was effective in changing diet and lifestyle patterns. METHODS: A diverse sample of women with stage 0-III breast cancer were randomized to a control or intervention group within 6 weeks of completion of adjuvant treatment. Both groups received the National Cancer Institute publication, Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment. The intervention group also met with a nurse (1 h) and a dietician (1 h) to receive personalized lifestyle recommendations based on national guidelines. Diet, lifestyle, and perceived health were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Linear regression analyzes assessed the effects of the intervention adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 126 women completed the study (60 control/66 intervention, 61 Hispanic/65 non-Hispanic women). After 3 months, the intervention group reported greater knowledge of healthy eating (P=0.047), the importance of physical activity (P=0.03), and appropriate use of dietary supplements (P=0.006), and lower frequency of alcohol consumption ( P=0.03) as controls. After 6 months, only more knowledge about a healthy diet persisted (P = 0.01). The intervention was more effective in improving attitudes towards healthy eating (P=0.03) and frequency of physical activity (P=0.006) in non-Hispanics than in Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention changed lifestyle behavior and knowledge in the short term, but the benefits were not permanent. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Culturally competent long-term behavioral interventions should be tested beyond the survival plan to facilitate long-term behavior change in breast cancer survivors.",0,0,

1698,Systematic Review: An Evaluation of the Major Commercial Weight Loss Programs in the United States,"Background: Each year, millions of Americans enroll in commercial and self-help weight loss programs. Health care providers and their obese patients know little about these programs due to the lack of systematic reviews. Purpose: To describe the components, costs, and effectiveness of the major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States that offer structured in-person or online counseling. Data Sources: Company website reviews, phone calls to company representatives, and MEDLINE database search. Study selection: Randomized studies of at least 12 weeks duration, enrolling only adults, that assessed interventions as typically made available to the public or case series that met these criteria, reported the number of enrollments, and a follow-up assessment included that lasted 1 year or more. Data Extraction: Data on study design, attrition, weight loss, duration of follow-up, and maintenance of weight loss were extracted. Data Synthesis: We found studies from eDiets.com, Health Management Resources, Take Off Pounds Sensibly, OPTIFAST, and Weight Watchers. Of 3 Weight Watchers randomized controlled trials, the largest reported a 3.2% loss of baseline weight at 2 years. A randomized study and multiple case series of medically supervised very low-calorie diet programs found that patients who completed treatment lost approximately 15% to 25% of their baseline weight. These programs were associated with high costs, high failure rates, and a high probability of regaining 50% or more of the weight lost in 1 to 2 years. Commercial interventions available over the internet and organized self-help programs resulted in minimal weight loss. Limitations: Because many studies did not account for high turnover rates, the reported results are likely to represent a best-case scenario. Conclusions: With the exception of 1 study from Weight Watchers, the evidence supporting the use of major commercial and self-help weight loss programs is suboptimal. Controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these interventions.",0,0,
1699,Systematic review: Elected induction of labor versus expectant management of pregnancy,"BACKGROUND: Rates of labor induction and elective labor induction are increasing. Whether elective labor induction improves outcomes or simply leads to greater complications and healthcare costs is a widely debated topic in the literature (2009), Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to March 2009), bibliographies of included studies, and previous systematic ones reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Experimental and observational studies on elective labor induction reported in English. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors abstracted the study design, patient characteristics, quality criteria and outcomes, including cesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal morbidity.DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 6117 potentially relevant articles, 36 met the inclusion criteria: 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 25 observational studies. A total of one was wait and see Pregnancy management associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) of cesarean than elective induction (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.39]; absolute risk difference, 1.9 percentage points [CI, 0.2 to 3 .7 percentage points]) in 9 RCTs. Women ≥ 41 completed weeks' gestation who were treated expectantly had a higher risk of having a cesarean section (OR, 1.21 [CI, 1.01 to 1.46]), but this difference was statistical in women less than 41 completed weeks gestation not significant (OR, 1.73 [CI, 0.67 to 4.5]). Women who received watchful waiting were more likely to have meconium-stained amniotic fluid than women who were electively initiated (OR, 2.04 [CI, 1.34 to 3.09]). LIMITATIONS: There were no recent RCTs on elective labor induction at less than 41 weeks gestation. The 2 studies conducted at less than 41 weeks gestation were of poor quality and not transferrable to current practice. CONCLUSION: RCTs suggest that elective labor induction at 41 weeks gestation and beyond is associated with a reduced risk of cesarean section and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. There are concerns about translating these findings into actual practice.” Therefore, future studies should examine elective labor induction in settings where most obstetric care is provided.",0,0,
1700,Systematic Review: The Long-Term Effects of False-Positive Mammograms,"BACKGROUND: Although abnormal screening mammograms deleteriously affect women's psychological well-being during the immediate testing environment, their long-term effects are poorly understood. PURPOSE: To characterize the long-term effects of false-positive screening mammograms on the behavior and well-being of women aged 40 and older. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies from MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases up to August 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that examined the effects of false-positive routine screening mammography results on behavior, well-being, or beliefs were identified of women.DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators independently coded study characteristics, quality, and effect sizes.DATA SYNTHESIS: 23 eligible studies (n=313,967) were identified. A random effects meta-analysis showed that US women who received false-positive screening mammography results were more likely to return to routine screening than those who received normal results (hazard ratio 1.07 [95% CI , 1.02 to 1.12]). The effect was not statistically significant in European women (hazard ratio 0.97 [CI 0.93 to 1.01]), and Canadian women were less likely to return to routine screening because of false positive results (hazard ratio 0.63 [CI 0.50 to 0.80]). Women who received false-positive results were more likely to perform breast self-exams and had higher, but not obviously pathologically elevated, levels of stress and anxiety and more thought of breast cancer than women with normal results, a number of studies suggesting a lack of clinical validation for many measures and possible heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Some women with false-positive mammogram results may differ in their return to mammography, occurrence of breast self-examination, and level of anxiety compared to women with normal results. Future research should examine how false positive results in mammography affect other results, such as B. Trust and utilization of health care.",0,0,
1701,Systematic Review: The Value of Periodic Health Assessment,"Background: Periodic health assessment (PHE) has been a fundamental part of medical practice for decades, although there is no consensus as to its value. Purpose: Synthesis of evidence on the benefits and harms of PHE. Data Sources: Electronic searches of such databases B. MEDLINE and Cochrane Library, review of reference lists, and manual search of peer-reviewed journals up to September 2006. Study Selection: Studies (English only) evaluating the provision of prevention services, clinical outcomes and costs in patients who who receive PHE versus those receiving usual care. Data Extraction: Study design and settings, descriptions of PHE, and clinical outcomes associated with PHE. DATA SYNTHESIS: The best available evidence assessing the benefits or harms of PHE consisted of 21 studies published from 1973 to 2004. The PHE had a consistently favorable association with patients undergoing pelvic exams and Papanicolaou smears, cholesterol screening, and fecal occult blood testing. The PHE also had a positive effect on patient ""worry"" in a randomized controlled trial, but had mixed effects on other clinical outcomes and costs. Limitations: The descriptions of the PHE and the outcomes were heterogeneous. Some studies were conducted before the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were promulgated, limiting their applicability to modern practice. Although additional research is needed to clarify the long-term benefits, harms, and costs of maintaining PHE, the demonstration of benefit in this study warrants the implementation of PHE in clinical practice.""",0,0,
1702,Systematic reviews examining the translation of research into practice and the impact on population health are needed,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the focus of the research translation phase (T1-T4) of systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). In short, T1 includes reviews of basic science experiments; T2 includes reviews of human studies that led to the development of guidelines; T3 includes reviews examining how guidelines can be translated into policy and practice;' and T4 includes reviews describing the impact of changing health practices on population outcomes. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional review of randomly selected reviews of CDSR (n=500) and DARE (n=500) was performed. The research translation phase of reviews overall and by communicable disease, noncommunicable disease, and injury subgroups was coded by two investigators. RESULTS: A total of 898 reviews examined a communicable, noncommunicable, or injury-related disease. Of these, 98% of reviews within CDSR focused on T2 and the remaining 2% on T3. For DARE, 88% focused on T2, 8.7% on T1, 2.5% on T3, and 1.3% on T4. Almost all reviews examining communicable (CDSR 100%, DARE 93%), non-communicable (CDSR 98%, DARE 87%), and injuries (CDSR 95%, DARE 88%) were also T2-focused. CONCLUSION: There are few reviews to help practitioners and policy makers implement evidence-based treatments or programs.",0,0,

1704,Systems of care for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a report from the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline,"BACKGROUND: National guidelines require participation in systems for the rapid diagnosis and treatment of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). To characterize currently implemented STEMI reperfusion systems and to identify practices common to system organization, the American Heart Association surveyed existing systems in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: A STEMI system was defined as an integrated group of separate entities focused on reperfusion therapy for STEMI within a geographic region that included at least 1 hospital performing percutaneous coronary interventions and at least 1 emergency medical department. Systems that fit this definition were invited to participate in a 42-question survey based on a panel of experts' opinion and knowledge of existing systems. Data was collected through the American Heart Association's Mission: Lifeline website. Between April 2008 and January 2010, 381 individual systems representing 899 percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals in 47 states responded to the survey, of which 255 systems (67%) were in metropolitan areas. The predominant sources of funding for STEMI systems were percutaneous coronary intervention clinics (n=320, 84%) and/or cardiac practices (n=88, 23%). Predominant system characteristics identified in the survey included: STEMI patient acceptance in the hospital for percutaneous coronary intervention regardless of bed availability (N=346, 97%)"", activation of the catheterization laboratory by a single call (N=335, 92%), physician of the Emergency room activation of the laboratory without cardiac consultation (N = 318, 87%); participation in the data register (N = 311, 84%);"" and prehospital activation of the lab by emergency room without cardiology notification (N=297, 78%). The most common barriers to system implementation were hospital (n=139, 37%) and cardiology group competition (n=81, 21%), and ambulance transport and finances (n=99, 26%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey broadly describes the organizational characteristics of how hospitals and emergency medical services work together to provide timely reperfusion in the United States. These results serve as a benchmark for existing systems and should help healthcare teams organize the care of patients with STEMI.",0,0,
1705,Tailored Information Increases Discussion Between Patients and Physicians About Colon Cancer Risk and Testing: The Cancer Risk Intake System Study,"Assess whether receiving customized printouts created by the Cancer Risk Intake System (CRIS) — a touchscreen computer program that collects data from patients and creates printouts for patients and doctors — has led to more reported discussions between patients and providers about colorectal cancer (CRC) leads. Risk and screening as receiving non-tailored information. Cluster-randomized study, randomized by the physician, with data collected via pre-visit CRIS and a 2-week follow-up telephone survey in 623 patients. Patients 25 to 75 years of age with upcoming primary care visits who are eligible for but currently not adhering to CRC screening guidelines. Patient-reported discussions with providers about CRC risk and testing. Tailored recipients were more likely to report patient-physician discussions about personal and family risks, stool testing, and colonoscopy (all p<0.05). Tailored recipients were more likely to report discussions about: cancer risk (+10%), family history (+15%), stool testing (+9%), and colonoscopy (+8%) (all p<0.05). CRIS is a promising strategy to facilitate discussions about testing in primary care.",0,1,
1706,Tailored competency training for practitioners to improve assessment of prognostic factors for persistent and disabling low back pain: four single-point quasi-experimental studies,"The well-known gap between guidelines and behavior in clinical practice requires effective behavior change interventions. An example showing this gap is the underestimation of psychosocial prognostic factors in back pain by physical therapists (ie yellow flags). The present study aimed to evaluate an educational model by conducting a tailored skill training intervention for nurses and examining the changes over time in physiotherapists' assessment of prognostic factors in telephone consultations. A single-subject, quasi-experimental design was used over 36 weeks, with repeated measurements during the baseline, intervention, and postintervention periods. Four primary care physiotherapists recorded a total of 63 consultations with patients. The tailored intervention included individual goal setting, skills training, and performance feedback. The primary outcome was the number of prognostic factors evaluated (0-10). Changes were noted in all four participants. The number of prognostic factors assessed increased from 0 to 2 at baseline to 6 to 10 after the intervention. The time spent assessing psychosocial factors increased and the time spent discussing biomedical pain symptoms decreased. Knowledge and biopsychosocial attitudes towards back pain conformed to the guidelines upon admission and did not change significantly during the intervention. Self-efficacy in assessing cognitive and emotional prognostic factors increased during the study phases. The results suggest that a tailored skill training intervention using behavior modification techniques such as B. individual goal setting, skill training and feedback on performance, is effective in inducing change in specific clinical behaviors in physiotherapists.",0,1,
1707,Targeted Intervention Programs: Creating a Tailored Practice Model to Improve the Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis in a Managed Care Population,"AIM: To develop an intervention program to improve health outcomes in patients with allergic rhinitis in a managed care setting. STUDY DESIGN: The Lovelace Health Systems Episodes of Care (EOC) team selected allergic rhinitis for an intervention program because it was identified as one of the top 10 reasons for visits to primary care clinics. The intervention program was based on a multidisciplinary team process aimed at creating a tailored educational program for providers and patients to address inconsistencies or deficiencies in the management of allergic rhinitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The EOC team reviewed literature and current practices, then identified inconsistencies in diagnostic and treatment patterns. Based on this research, the team developed guidelines and a training program for providers. Intervention strategies were structured around decision points in a treatment protocol. More than 500 patients were monitored throughout allergy season using written and telephone surveys, symptom diaries, and encounter data. Measurable outcomes for provider and patient behavior were identified. Patient outcomes were derived from a preventive behavioral index and administrative data reporting use of 5 classes of drugs. RESULTS: Approximately 50% of providers changed their practice patterns as a result of the intervention program. Patient outcomes showed a decrease in the use of rescue medication, particularly antibiotics, and an increase in preventive measures in the treatment group compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The EOC model led to positive changes in provider and patient behavior. The multidisciplinary approach resulted in broad vendor participation.",0,0,
1708,Targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: an overview of the development of a new class of drugs from the perspective of mental health researchers in the community,"INTRODUCTION: Schizophrenia is a chronic disease associated with positive and negative symptoms and widespread deficits in neurocognitive function. Neurocognitive deficits are considered to be the central pathophysiological symptoms of the disease. Neurocognitive deficits are also closely related to functional outcome. Currently, cognitive deficits remain one of the most important unmet therapeutic needs in schizophrenia. AREAS COVERED: Neuroscientific discoveries over the past few decades have enriched our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. This research has identified new molecular mechanisms and processes as promising pharmacological targets. However, despite extensive efforts to develop a new class of cognitive-enhancing drugs to treat schizophrenia over the past 5 years, no novel pharmacological agent has received regulatory approval as required by the Food and Drug Administration. Efficacy and safety results from selected phase II clinical trials are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: The evolving concept of neurocognition and current guidelines for the design and methodology of clinical trials of cognition-enhancing drugs for the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia are critically reviewed. Future directions in the development of cognitive-enhancing drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia from the perspective of clinicians and researchers from community mental health organizations are discussed.",0,0,
1709,Task Force VI: Self-monitoring of blood pressure,"BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients at home or in other non-hospital settings has become increasingly common in recent years. This phenomenon has been fueled in part by the increasing availability of automatic blood pressure monitors, which are now both affordable and easy for patients to use. BENEFITS OF SELF-MONITORING: Self-monitoring of blood pressure can be an important adjunct to the management of hypertension. Technology enables patients to be more involved in their care. Self-measured blood pressure values are more representative of average daily blood pressure than a clinical measurement and may be better associated with hypertensive target organ involvement and cardiovascular morbidity than clinical blood pressure. Finally, self-monitoring of blood pressure has the potential to reduce the cost of treating hypertension. LIMITATIONS OF SELF-MONITORING: There are several issues that prevent the more widespread use of self-monitoring of blood pressure in clinical practice. First, devices marketed for patient use have technically advanced in the 1990s, but many have not undergone rigorous clinical validation for precision and reliability (e.g., in relation to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation guidelines and the British Hypertension Society). It is recommended that blood pressure measurement devices used by patients at home undergo the same validation processes as those used for ambulatory recording. Second, although the upper limits of the normal value for the self-monitored blood pressure of a general population can be statistically defined (it is approximately 135/85 mmHg), it is not yet possible to determine the normal self-monitored blood pressure, since these values are required with classical clinical cardiovascular Endpoints or outcomes are linked. Third, the relationships between self-monitored, clinical, and ambulatory blood pressure readings are well defined for some populations, but their behavior with respect to age, gender, race, and treatment status requires further investigation. Fourth, several different schedules for patient self-monitoring of blood pressure have been used in clinical research and practice. It is necessary to determine the optimal schedule and number of recordings required when patients conduct self-monitoring of blood pressure. Fifth, self-monitoring of blood pressure is certainly feasible in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapies, but has typically not been included in their design by researchers or pharmaceutical sponsors. Sixth, there is data to suggest that self-monitoring of blood pressure reduces the overall costs associated with treating hypertension annually. However, since most of the work on the economic impact of self-monitoring of blood pressure in managed care settings has been conducted in the US, it is not known whether this healthcare cost reduction would be applicable to other types of practice settings on a global basis. CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring of blood pressure is currently useful as an adjunctive measurement in the management of hypertensive patients and could be useful in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy. However, the available data on self-monitoring of blood pressure are insufficient to provide physicians with a basis for primary diagnostic or therapeutic decisions and should not override blood pressure determined by clinical measurement or ambulatory monitoring.",0,0,
1710,Teaching appropriate interactions with pharmaceutical company representatives: the impact of an innovative workshop on student attitudes,"BACKGROUND: Pharmaceutical company representatives (PCRs) influence the prescribing habits and professional behavior of physicians. However, the skills to interact with PCRs are not taught in the traditional medical school curriculum. We examined whether an innovative mandatory workshop for third-year medical students had an immediate impact on knowledge and attitudes about interactions with PCRs. METHODS: Surveys conducted before and after the workshop intervention solicited opinions (five-point Likert scales) from third-year students (n = 75) about the degree of bias in PCR information, the impact of PCRs on prescribing habits, the acceptance of certain gifts, and the educational value of PCR information for both practicing physicians and students. Two faculty members and one PCR led the workshop, which highlighted typical physician-PCR interactions, the use of specimens and gifts, the validity and legal limitations of PCR information, and related ethical issues. Role playing with the PCR demonstrated appropriate and inappropriate strategies for interacting with PCRs. RESULTS: The majority of third-year students (56%, 42/75) had experienced more than three face-to-face interviews involving a PCR about a drug product since entering medical school. Five percent (4/75) said they had no personal experience with PCRs. Most students (57.3%, 43/75) were unaware of the available guidelines on PCR interactions. Twenty-eight percent of students (21/75) felt that none of the named activities/gifts (lunch, free stethoscope, textbooks, educational CD-ROMs, sporting events) should be restricted, while 24.0% (8/75) were of the opinion that students should only be excluded from sporting events. The perceived educational value of PCR information for both practitioners and students increased from 17.7% to 43.2% (chi-square, p=0.0001) and 22.1%, respectively, after the workshop intervention 40.5% (p=0.0007). Student perceptions of the degree of bias in PCR information decreased from 84.1% to 72.9% (p=0.065), but the perceived degree of influence on prescription increased (44.2% to 62.1% (p= 0.02)). CONCLUSIONS: Students are exposed to PCRs early in their medical education. A single workshop intervention can influence student attitudes towards interactions with PCRs. Students were more likely to recognize the educational value of the PCR interactions and their impact on prescribing after the workshop intervention.",0,0,
1711,Teaching hospital medical staff how to wash hands,"Objective Increase the frequency of hand washing by medical staff. Design A prospective study of handwashing before and after patient contact. Setting A pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary level hospital. Participants 61 ICU medical staff and visiting medical staff. Interventions A five-phase behavior change program: (i) unobtrusive observation for four weeks to obtain a baseline of handwashing; (ii) open observation for five weeks (prior written consultation); (iii) open-ended observation continued for four weeks with performance feedback; (iv) suspended all observations and feedback for seven weeks;"" and (v) unremarkable observation for five weeks to obtain a residual rate. Results 939 patient contacts were observed. The baseline handwashing rates before and after patient contact were 12.4% and 10.6% During the open observation, the respective rates increased and stabilized at 32.7% and 33.3%, but continued to increase during the performance feedback period (to 68.3% and 64.8%). Residual handwashing rates, observed unobtrusively seven weeks after the completion of performance feedback, were 54.6% before and 54.9% after patient contact.ConclusionsPerformance feedback is moderately effective in training hospital medical staff to wash hands.",0,1,
1712,"Unraveling ""the tangled web"" of the impact of policy dialogues: Lessons from a case study of dialogues on health care reform options for Canada","Background The knowledge-sharing literature suggests that policy dialogues should serve to improve the short-, medium- and long-term abilities of individuals, organizations and health systems to use evidence for decision-making. Key characteristics of effective dialogues have been suggested, but the links between these characteristics and the realization of improved capacities for evidence-based policymaking among dialogue participants and the subsequent impact on policymaking are not well understood. Methods We conducted a qualitative case study of a series of four policy dialogues convened in Canada in 2011 between national, provincial and regional stakeholders on issues related to health care funding and funding. Data sources included videos of participant perspectives recorded during or immediately after each dialogue event and follow-up interviews with key informants among dialogue participants that took place 4 years later in 2015. Factors shaping the implementation of evidence guided the thematic analysis. We then synthesized the results across the three frameworks. Results The results indicate that the potential benefits of the policy dialogues described in the literature were developed among the participants of these dialogues. The informants explained how the characteristics of the dialogue influenced their ability to use evidence, the ideas, interests and institutions during the agenda setting and policy formulation phases of policy making, and how implementation is influenced by characteristics of policy options, individuals, organizations and the external environment was and processes. Conclusions We present a conceptual framework that advances our understanding of the potential influence of policy dialogues on the content and mechanisms of policy development, and illustrates pathways of influence at different stages of the policy cycle, from agenda setting to formulation and implementation. The framework highlights important factors to consider when designing and evaluating policy dialogues and supporting post-dialogue knowledge-sharing efforts.",0,0,
1713,Education via teleconference: Diabetes education for general practitioners,"INTRODUCTION: Formal continuing education courses (CME) are relatively ineffective in changing physician behavior. Diabetes mellitus is an increasingly prevalent condition, and interventions are needed to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). METHODS: A stratified, cluster-randomized, controlled study design was used to assess the effects of Teleconferenced Educational Detailing (TED-CME) on glycemic control (hemoglobin [Hb] A1c) and primary care physician compliance with national diabetes guidelines. TED used sequential, case-based, small-group training using guidelines provided by a diabetes specialist. Medical record review data from baseline to the end of a 12-month post-intervention period were compared for the control and intervention groups. Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed. RESULTS: 61 physicians provided 660 medical records. The intervention had no effect on mean HbA1c levels but significantly (p=0.04) changed the distribution of patients by category of glycemic control, with fewer patients in the intervention group having inadequate control (15.8% vs. 23, 9%). More patients were taking insulin (alone or with oral agents) in the intervention group (21.2% versus 12.0%, p=0.03) and more patients were taking oral agents alone in the control group (89.0% versus 82, 9%, p=0.005) . More patients in the intervention group had documentation of body mass index (7.8% versus 1.9%, p<0.02), eye examination (12.1% versus 5.1%, p=0.02 ) and treatment plan (43.5% versus 23.6%, p=0.01) and used a flowchart (14.6% versus 7.7%, p<0.03). Although generally satisfied with the conference call format, specialist educators found the format more challenging than GPs. DISCUSSION: CME, conducted via conference call, was feasible, well attended, well received by participants, and improved some key diabetes management practices and outcomes.",0,0,
1714,Telemedicine for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease: pragmatic randomized controlled trial,"GOAL Ã‚Â Assess whether non-clinical staff can effectively treat people at high risk of cardiovascular disease using digital health technologies. DESIGN – Pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, controlled study. RECRUITMENT 42 GP practices in three areas of England. PARTICIPANTS Ã‚Â Between December 3, 2012 and July 23, 2013, we recruited 641 adults aged 40 to 74 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of 20% or greater, no prior cardiovascular event, at least one modifiable risk factor (systolic blood pressure Ã 140 mm Hg, body mass index 30, current smoker) and access to telephone, internet and e-mail. Participants were individually assigned to intervention (n=325) or control (n=316) groups using automated randomization, stratified by location, minimized by practice, and baseline risk score. INTERVENTIONS Intervention was the Healthlines service (alongside usual care) which included regular telephone calls from trained lay health workers following scripts generated by interactive software. Counselors facilitated self-management by helping participants use online resources to reduce risk factors and sought to optimize drug use, improve adherence to therapy, and promote healthier lifestyles. The control group included only usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who responded to treatment, defined as maintaining or reducing their cardiovascular risk at 12 months. The results were collected six and twelve months after randomization and analyzed in a masked manner. The participants were not masked. RESULTS 50% (148/295) of participants in the intervention group responded to treatment compared to 43% (124/291) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.9"" , number required to treat = 13); a difference possibly due to chance (p = 0.08) mean diastolic -2.8 (-4.0 to -1.6 mmHg); weight -1, 0 kg (-1.8 to -0.3 kg) and body mass index -0.4 (-0.6 to -0.1) but not cholesterol -0.1 (-0.2 to 0 .0), smoking status (adjusted odds ratio 0.4, 0.2 to 1.0), or total cardiovascular risk as a continuous measure (-0.4, -1.2 to 0.3)).The intervention was associated with improvements in diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and satisfaction with access to care, treatment received, and care coordination A serious adverse event occurred when a participant was admitted to the hospital with low blood pressure became. CONCLUSIONS This evidence-based telemedicine approach was associated with small clinical benefits for a minority of people at high cardiovascular risk, and there was no overall mean risk improvement. However, the Healthlines service has been associated with improvements in some risk behaviors and perceptions of support and access to medical care.",0,0,
1715,Telephone care management to improve cancer screening among low-income women,"BackgroundMinority and low-income women receive fewer cancer screenings than other women.ObjectiveTo evaluate the effect of a telephone support intervention in increasing screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in minority and low-income women.DesignRandomized controlled study conducted between November was 2001 and April 2004. Established 11 community and migrant health centers in New York City. 1413 patients overdue for cancer screening Control group received usual care. Follow-up data were available for 99% of women, and 91% of the intervention group received at least 1 call Women who had mammography increased from 0.58 to 0.68 with the intervention and decreased from 0.60 to 0, 58 with usual treatment; the proportion having Papanicolaou tests increased from 0.71 to 0.78 with the intervention and remained unchanged with usual care;' and the proportion having colorectal screening increased with the intervention from 0.39 to 0.63 and with of the usual care from 0.39 to 0.50. The difference in change in screening rates between groups was 0.12 for mammography (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.19), 0.07 for the Papanicolaou test (CI, 0.01 to 0 .12) and 0.13 for colorectal screening (CI, 0.07 to 0.19). The proportion of women who were up to date for 3 tests increased from 0.21 to 0.43 with the intervention. Limitations Participants were from a city and had access to a regular source of care. Medical records may not have recorded all cancer screenings. Conclusions Telephone support can improve cancer screening rates among women attending community and migrant health centers. The intervention appears well-suited to health plans, large medical groups, and other organizations trying to increase cancer screening rates and address inequalities in care.",0,0,
1716,"Telephone screening, outreach, and care management for depressed workers and impact on clinical and work productivity outcomes: a randomized controlled trial","Context Although guideline-compliant treatment for depression is clearly effective, treatment often falls short of evidence-based recommendations. Organized depression treatment programs significantly improve the quality of care, but employer buyers have been slow to adopt these programs because they believe there is no evidence of cost-effectiveness. Objective To assess the impact of an outreach treatment program for depression on workplace outcomes, a concern of employers. Design, Setting, and Participants In a randomized controlled trial of 604 employees covered by a managed behavioral health plan, a two-stage screening process was used to determine that they had significant depression. Patient treatment assignment was concealed and assessments of depression severity and work performance at months 6 and 12 were blinded. Employees with lifelong bipolar disorder, substance use disorder, recent specialty psychiatric treatment, or suicidal tendencies were excluded. Intervention A telephone counseling and care management program encouraged staff to engage in outpatient treatment (psychotherapy and/or antidepressants), monitored continuity of care quality, and attempted to improve care by providing referrals to providers. Participants who resisted treatment were offered structured cognitive-behavioural psychotherapy over the phone. Main outcome measures depression severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, QIDS) and job performance (World Health Organization Health and Productivity Questionnaire [HPQ], a validated self-report instrument that assesses job retention, absenteeism from work, job performance, and critical job incidents). Results Combining data from 6- and 12-month assessments, the intervention group had significantly lower QIDS self-report scores (relative odds of cure, 1.4 inches; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0; P=0.009). higher job retention (relative probability 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.3; P = 0.02) and significantly more work hours during the intervention (ß = 2.0; P = 0.02; ""corresponding to a annualized effect of 2 weeks of work) than the usual caregiving groups that were employed.Conclusions A systematic program to detect depression and promote effective treatment not only improves clinical outcomes but also workplace outcomes significantly.The financial value of the latter for employers in covering hiring, training and salary costs suggests that many employers are seeing a positive return on investment from outreach e and improved treatment of depressed workers.",0,0,
1717,Telephone assisted cooperative care for the treatment of depression after CABG,"Context Depressive symptoms often follow coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and are associated with less favorable clinical outcomes. Aim To test the effectiveness of cooperative care provided by telephone for post-CABG depression compared to usual medical care. Design, Setting, and Participants Single-blinded efficacy study at 7 college and community hospitals in or near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants were 302 post-CABG patients with depression (150, intervention""; 152, usual care) and a comparison group of 151 randomly selected post-CABG patients without depression, recruited between March 2004 and September 2007 and until June 2008 as outpatients were observed. Intervention Eight months of collaborative telephone care provided by nurses working with patients' primary care physicians and monitored by a psychiatrist and primary care physician from this study Main outcome measures Mental health-related quality of life (HRQL) as measured by the short form -36 Mental Component Summary (SF-36 MCS) at 8-month follow-up; secondary outcome measures included assessment of mood symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRS-D]), physical HRQL (SF-36 PCS), and functional status (Duke Activity Status Index [DASI]), and hospital readmissions. Outcomes The intervention patients reported greater improvements mental HRQL (all P=0.02) (SF-36 MCS: ?, 3.2 points; 95% confidence e-interval [CI], 0.5-6.0), physical functioning (DASI: ?, 4.6 points; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3) and mood symptoms (HRS-D: ?, 3.1 points; 95% CI, 1.3-4.9); and were more likely to report a decrease in HRS-D score of 50% or more from baseline (50.0% vs. 29.6%; number to treat: 4.9 [95% CI, 3.2-10 .4]) than patients with normal care (P < .001). Men with depression were particularly likely to benefit from the intervention (SF-36 MCS: ?, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 2.2-9.2; P=0.001). However, the mean HRQL and physical functioning of the intervention patients did not reach those of the non-depressed comparison group. Conclusion Compared with usual care, telephone cooperative care for the treatment of depression after CABG resulted in improvements in HRQL, physical functioning, and mood symptoms at follow-up 8 months.",0,0,
1718,Telepraxis in the assessment and treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review,"AIM: Studies involving the use of telepractice in the delivery of services to persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were reviewed with the intention of informing practice and identifying areas for future research. METHODS: Systematic searches of electronic databases, reference lists, and journals identified eight studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed and summarized in terms of: (a) characteristics of the participants, (b) technology used, (c) services provided via telepractice, (d) research methodology, and (e) results of the study. RESULTS: Telepractice was used by academic researchers, behavior analysts, psychiatrists, and psychologists to assist caregivers and educators in delivering services to 46 participants with ASD. Services provided included behavioral and diagnostic assessments, educational advice, guidance and monitoring of behavioral interventions, and coaching/training in implementing a comprehensive early intervention program. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that telepractice is a promising approach to service delivery in the management of individuals with ASD that requires additional research. Guidelines for practitioners and possible directions for future research are discussed.",0,0,
1719,Trial ordering policies may alter ordering patterns in an academic ER,"To determine the effects of an educational program to change test-ordering behavior in an academic emergency department (ED), an observational before-and-after study was conducted at a university-level tertiary referral center and an emergency medicine (EM) residential site. Test order standards were developed by EM faculty, RNs, and NPs based on group consensus and published data. The standards were distributed to all ED staff beginning February 1996 and were included in the Evidence-Based Medicine Orientation and Training Program for all residents and medical students prior to the start of their rotation. No restrictions were imposed on the actual test order. The number of laboratory tests ordered per 100 patients (total and individual) decreased significantly after the start of the educational program for: total tests, CBC and liver function test (LFT). In addition, the decreases during individual months for these tests were statistically significant. Prothrombin time and blood culture tests did not show a significant decrease in test order frequency. The frequency of ordering chemical tests showed statistically significant increases. Overall, about $50,000 was saved by reducing the number of test orders. Test ordering behavior can be modified and maintained through an educational program and can have a significant economic impact.",0,0,

1721,"Testing the effectiveness of an innovative information pack on physician-reported behaviors and beliefs: UK Chiropractors, Osteopaths and Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists Low Back Pain Management (COMPLeMENT) Trial [ISRCTN77245761","BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly problem. Initiatives designed to help physicians and patients make decisions about appropriate healthcare for LBP include printed evidence-based clinical guidelines. The three UK professions of chiropractic, osteopathy and musculoskeletal physiotherapy share a common ground in their approaches to treating LBP and are among those targeted by LBP guidelines. Despite this, many seem unaware that such guidelines exist. In addition, the behavior of at least some of these practitioners deviates from what is recommended in these guidelines. Few randomized controlled trials evaluating printed information as a physician behavior change intervention have used a no-intervention control group. All of these studies have used a cluster design and most have methodological flaws. None focuses specifically on physician behavior toward LBP patients. Studies examining other strategies to change physician behavior in LBP patients have yielded conflicting results. Although numerous LBP guidelines have been developed around the world, there is little data on whether their dissemination is actually changing physician behavior. Sending printed information to a large number of practitioners is an attractive dissemination and implementation strategy, mainly because of the low unit costs. The effect size of such a strategy at the individual practitioner level is likely to be small. However, if a large number of practitioners are reached, this strategy could bring about significant changes at the population level. METHODS: The main objective of this prospective, pragmatic, randomized, controlled study is to test the short-term efficacy (six months after the intervention) of a directly published information package about the reported clinical behavior (primary outcome), attitudes and beliefs of UK chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physiotherapists. We attempted to randomly assign a combined sample of 1,800 consenting practitioners to receive either the information package (intervention arm) or no information beyond that gleaned during normal practice (control arm). We collected questionnaire data at baseline and six months after the intervention. Analysis of the primary outcome will assess between-arm differences in the proportions of responses to activity, work, and bed rest recommendation questions that fall into categories previously defined by an expert consensus exercise as either ""guideline-compliant"" or ""guideline."" -inconsistent'.",0,0,

METHOD: A consensus conference was held on January 13-14, 2005, and was attended by academic clinicians and researchers, practicing clinicians, administrators, consumers and families. The focus was on reviewing, updating and incorporating the most up-to-date data to inform and recommend specific pharmacological approaches and clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorders in children and adolescents. RESULTS: Consensual medication algorithms for major depression (with and without psychosis) and comorbid attention-deficit disorders were updated. These revised algorithms also included approaches to treat suicidality, aggression, and irritability. Levels 1, 2 and 3 of the algorithm consist of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the use of which is supported by controlled acute clinical trials and clinical experience. Recent studies support that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are still recommended as first-line drugs in addition to fluoxetine. The need for additional evaluation, precautions and monitoring, as well as continuation and maintenance treatment is emphasized. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence and clinical expert consensus support the use of selected antidepressants in the treatment of depression in adolescents. Use of the recommended antidepressants requires appropriate monitoring for suicidal tendencies and potential side effects, as well as consideration of other evidence-based treatment alternatives such as cognitive behavioral therapies.",0,0,
1724,"The 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on treating blood cholesterol to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults: the good, the bad, and the uncertain aspects: a comparison with the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia","Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most important public health problem of our time in both Europe and the rest of the world, accounting for the largest expenditure in most health budgets. Achieving consistent clinical care, incorporating new knowledge and synthesizing it into practical recommendations for clinicians is the task of various guideline bodies around the world. Any change to a set of policies can therefore have far-reaching consequences, especially if they appear to conflict with existing policies. This article reviews the most recent 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on controlling blood cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults. Compared to the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines on lipid modification, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines differ significantly. In particular, (i) the scope is limited to randomized trials, which excludes a significant amount of data and essentially only promotes a statin-centric approach”; (ii) the elimination of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) targets advocated by specific statin therapies that produce a 30-50% reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels will, we believe, confuse many physicians and the Missing opportunity to adhere to medication and involve patients in self-care; (iii) the lack of target LDL-cholesterol levels in very high-risk patients with high absolute or residual risk factors will discourage clinicians from considering additional lipid modification treatments and individualizing patient care; (iv) lowering the threshold for treatment in primary prevention will result in a larger number of patients being treated on prescribed statin therapy, which is potentially good in young patients at high lifetime risk, but will result in a very large number of older ones patients are offered therapy;"" and (v) the mixed-pool risk calculator used to assess cardiovascular risk in the primary prevention guidelines has not been fully evaluated. This article discusses the potential impact of adopting the ACC/AHA guidelines on patient care in Europe and beyond and concludes with the opinion that the ESC/EAS guidelines of 2011 appear to be the most comprehensive, pragmatic and appropriate choice for European countries.",0,0,

1726,The AHCPR heart failure guidelines: comparison of a general practice and a medical practice with the guidelines and an educational behavior change intervention,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to apply the Agency for Health Policy and Research (AHCPR) guideline for heart failure to measuring quality of care in the outpatient setting, to compare the outcomes of two large practices, and to design a training intervention for the two practices studied . METHODS: A retrospective file review was performed on a random sample of 50 heart failure patients, each selected from two outpatient practices: general internal medicine practice and family practice at a large academic medical center. Five medical assessment criteria were developed from the AHCPR heart failure guideline to compare the two practices to each other and to the guidelines. An educational intervention was developed to change physician behavior related to adherence to guidelines. RESULTS: Left ventricular function was assessed in 79% of all cases. 68% of eligible patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is). Of the patients treated with enalapril and captopril, 30% and 12%, respectively, received the target dose defined in the AHCPR guidelines. Of the patients unsuitable for treatment with ACE-Is, none were treated with hydralazine and nitrates. When ejection fraction was less than or equal to 40%, 81% of eligible patients were treated with ACE-Is, while 59% were treated with ACE-Is when ejection fraction was greater than 40%. Calcium channel blockers were used in the treatment of 42% of patients. A statistical difference (p=0.05) was noted between the two practices for documenting left ventricular function, the use of ACE-Is in patients with an ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, and the use of calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. CONCLUSIONS: In the practices studied, documentation of left ventricular function, ACE-Is in eligible patients, target doses of ACE-Is, and use of hydralazine and nitrates in non-eligible patients is underutilized. A higher proportion of patients receive ACE-I therapy when the ejection fraction is less than or equal to 40%. Some patients may experience inappropriate use of calcium channel blockers. There are unexplained clinical differences between the two procedures studied.",0,0,
1727,The altruistic medical researcher: gone and forgotten?,"With increasing economic, political, and bureaucratic involvement in research, little attention is paid to the idealistic and benevolent intentions of the medical researcher. Benevolence is a pillar of human ethical research, and altruism is a form of benevolence that is difficult to quantify. It is an interest in the welfare of others without personal benefit. This article examines the extent of altruism in medical research from philosophical, psychological, and practical perspectives. With the advent of experimental human studies in the first half of the century, the fame and recognition of physicians largely precluded altruistic motivation. Philosophically, altruism is at best an optional moral principle. It is not apparent in ethical guidelines. In the scientific process, altruism can only exist in ethical and properly designed research. Selfishness, scientific misconduct and conflicts of interest undermine them"";"" but altruism is also a possible solution to these problems. Research is not globally oriented and distributed unfairly. In an evolutionary model, altruism cannot thrive due to its lack of rewards and feedback, especially in the economic climate of science today. Anonymity decreases, selfishness increases. Research has become an industry and virtuous ideals are a romantic notion. If we use altruism as an indicator, then its rarity and fragility indicate the unhealthy state of research.",0,0,

While practice guidelines provide consensus-based treatment recommendations from experts, little is known about the pharmacological decision-making of practicing psychopharmacologists in the ""real world."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an Internet survey of the national membership of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) to examine preferred pharmacotherapeutic strategies and factors influencing drug choice for patients with mood disorders. RESULTS: Surveys were returned by 154/752 ASCP members (21%). After failure to respond to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for major depressive disorder, participants equally preferred switching within or between antidepressant classes. After a partial response, adjunctive bupropion was the preferred intervention, followed by antidepressant class switching. Atypical antipsychotic augmentation was only a fourth-line consideration, although in most cases moderate or significant efficacy was perceived with olanzapine, aripiprazole, and quetiapine. Respondents preferred antidepressant avoidance in bipolar I patients with mixed/cyclic features or prior antidepressant-associated mania/hypomania. For rapid cyclers, they advocated stopping antidepressants and favored the use of atypical antipsychotics and lamotrigine. CONCLUSIONS: Participating psychopharmacologists treating adults with mood disorders report prescribing drugs that broadly reflect the evidence base, with only a few notable exceptions, accounting for the characteristics of definable clinical subpopulations.",0,0,

The additional budget that would be required for the UNAIDS Target Strategy would be ($7.965)$15.979 billion, giving an incremental cost benefit ratio (ICER) of ($2,720/YLS)$1,260/YLS, (< 50%) < 20% of South Africa's per capita GDP. Sensitivity Analysis Results The results generally differed from the base case results by less than 20% when we varied the key input parameters within plausible ranges. Limitations Multiple signaling pathways can lead to an overall suppression of 73% examined in the sensitivity analysis. Conclusions Achieving the 90-90-90 HIV suppression target would be costly, but both highly effective and cost-effective in South Africa.

1730,Application of an occupational health guideline reduces sedentary behavior and increases fruit consumption at work: results of an RCT,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a draft occupational health practice guideline aimed at preventing weight gain on staff physical activity, sedentary and dietary behaviors and body weight outcomes. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted between 2009 and 2011 comparing guideline-based care to usual care in 16 occupational physicians and 523 employees in the Netherlands and intervene in the obese work environment and conducted five face-to-face behavior change counseling sessions with employees, to improve their lifestyle. Staff data were collected through questionnaires and physical measurements at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Linear and logistic regression analyzes were carried out to determine the effects. RESULTS: The intervention showed significant effects on sedentary behavior at work (beta -28 min/day, 95% CI -2 to -54) and on fruit consumption (beta 2.1 items/week; 95% CI 0.6 to 3.6). No significant intervention effects were found for physical activity, sedentary behavior during leisure time or on weekend days, snack intake, and body weight-related endpoints.

To study the implementation of a protocol for assessment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in rural pediatric offices. The protocol was developed to provide pediatricians with an efficient means of learning and applying the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) ADHD guidelines. methods. Primary care staff (doctors, nurses, etc.) from 2 rural pediatric practices were trained in the use of the ADHD assessment protocol. The medical records of 101 patients were reviewed 1 to 2 years prior to the implementation of the protocol and of 86 patients in the following 2 to 3 years to assess compliance with the AAP guidelines. In addition, 34% of scales scored by staff were rescored to verify scoring accuracy. Results. Prior to the availability of the AAP guidelines and the implementation of the assessment protocol, none of the primary care sites consistently collected the comprehensive information that is now recommended for an ADHD assessment. Rating scales for parents and/or teachers were collected for only 0% to 21% of ratings at all sites. When supplemented with brief training and support materials, medical records reflected a significant improvement in identifying clinically necessary ADHD information, with parent and teacher rating scales present 88% to 100% of the time. The staff demonstrated the ability to rate rating scales with a high degree of accuracy. The integrity of log collection and management was maintained 2 to 3 years after training. Conclusions. An efficient system for conducting ADHD assessments per AAP guidelines in rural children's hospitals can be initiated and maintained with integrity.

Traditional economic theory offers limited tools for improving behavior because it assumes that people make decisions rationally, have the mental capacity to deal with vast amounts of information and choice, and have distinct tastes that cannot be manipulated . Behavioral economics combines economics with psychology and recognizes that people often do not act rationally in an economic sense. It therefore offers a potentially richer set of tools than traditional economic theory for understanding and influencing behavior. However, only recently in the healthcare sector. This article provides an overview of behavioral economics, reviews some of its contributions, and shows how it can be used in healthcare to improve people's decisions and health.",0,1,
1733,The behavior change wheel: A new method for characterizing and designing behavior change interventions,"Background Improving the design and implementation of evidence-based practices depends on successful behavior change interventions. This requires an appropriate method to characterize interventions and link them to an analysis of the intended behavior. There is a plethora of frameworks for behavior change interventions, but it is not clear how well they serve this purpose. This paper evaluates these frameworks and develops and evaluates a new framework that aims to overcome their limitations. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases and consultations with behavior change professionals were used to identify frameworks for behavior change interventions. These were evaluated according to three criteria: completeness, coherence and clear reference to a higher-level behavioral model. A new framework was developed to meet these criteria. The reliability with which it could be applied has been studied in two areas of behavior change: tobacco control and obesity. Results Nineteen frameworks were identified, covering nine intervention functions and seven policy categories that might enable those interventions. None of the frameworks reviewed covered the full range of intervention functions or measures, and only a minority met the criteria of coherence or linkage to a behavioral model. At the heart of a proposed new framework is a 'behavioural system' that encompasses three essential conditions: ability, opportunity and motivation (what we call the 'COM-B system'). This forms the center of a 'Behaviour Change Wheel' (BCW) around which are arranged the nine intervention features aimed at addressing deficits in one or more of these disorders'; Arranged around these are seven categories of policies that could enable these interventions. The BCW has been reliably used to characterize interventions under the UK Department of Health's Tobacco Control Strategy 2010 and the National Institutes of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for reducing obesity. Conclusions Behavior change interventions and measures can usefully be characterized in terms of a BCW, which includes: a 'behavioural system' at the top, surrounded by intervention functions, and then categories of measures. Research is needed to determine to what extent BCW can lead to more efficient design of effective interventions.",0,0,

METHODS: Within the GP practice management software, several system modifications were designed to identify the patient cohort eligible for cardiovascular risk screening, calculate cardiovascular disease risk (CVR), and collect the data for reporting of screening results and clinical management indicators at high risk extract patients. After a baseline audit, the system changes were tested over a 12-month period in three general practices with a total of 30,963 enrolled patients. RESULTS: A total of 6570 NZGG-eligible patients were identified"";"" 20.1% of these were Maori and 19.7% were Pacific people (mainly of Samoan, Tongan, Niuean or Cook Islands origin). Over 12 months, cardiovascular risk assessment screening rates increased from 4.7% to 53.5% for the cohort. Of the 3516 patients screened, 482 (13.7%) had established cardiovascular disease. An additional 230 (6.5%) had diabetes without CVD and 646 (18.4%) had a 5-year CVD risk > or = 15% Management data were available for 232 (48.1%) of the patients with CVD , 74%, 65%, and 79% were taking aspirin, statins, and antihypertensive drugs, respectively. Fifty-five percent exceeded the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) target of 2.5 mmol/L, 62% had a systolic blood pressure (BP) above the target of 130 mmHg, 18% were still smoking, and only 9% met all clinical targets recommended in the guideline. Of 646 with a 5-year CVD risk > or = up to 15%, management data were available for 347 (53.7%). Only 34% received aspirin, 40% statins and 57% antihypertensive drugs. 40% of this group had a systolic BP > 140 mmHg, 36% an LDL > 3.5 mmol/L, with only 7% of the patients achieving all clinical target values of the guideline. CONCLUSIONS: The system changes encompassing this intervention have dramatically increased cardiovascular risk assessment rates in a primary care setting and will facilitate appropriate targeting of intensive cardiovascular preventive interventions to close the observed treatment gap.",0,1,

1737,The challenge of transferring an implementation strategy from science to practice: a process evaluation of local quality improvement collaborations in Dutch primary care using normalization process theory,"Rationale, Objectives, and Objectives: A quality improvement strategy consisting of comparative feedback and peer review embedded in available local quality improvement collaborations proved effective in changing primary care physician test ordering behavior. However, the implementation of this strategy was problematic. Our goal was the large-scale implementation of a customized strategy covering both trial ordering and prescription performance. Since we were not able to implement it on a large scale, the aim of this study was to describe and analyze the challenges of the transfer process. Methods: In a qualitative study, 19 provincial health officers, pharmacists, laboratory specialists and general practitioners were interviewed within 6 months after the transfer. The interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and coded independently by two of the authors. The codes have been adapted to the dimensions of the normalization process theory. RESULTS: The basic idea of the strategy was widely accepted, however, the generation of the feedback was more complex than expected and the need for external support after the transfer of the strategy remained high, as the participants did not take on the work involved and the allocation of resources with it. CONCLUSION: Evidence of effectiveness, a national infrastructure for these collaborations and a generally positive attitude were not sufficient for normalization. When planning complex quality improvement strategies, the management of large databases, the responsibility for tasks and the allocation of resources should be considered as early as possible. It is not enough to just examine the barriers and facilitators experienced in a previous process. Although multifaceted implementation strategies for changing professional behavior are attractive, their inherent complexity is also a pitfall for large-scale implementation.",0,0,
1738,The clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of low-intensity psychological interventions for secondary prevention of relapse after depression: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Depression is the most common mental disorder in social settings and a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission or at least adequate control of depressive symptoms, but even after successful treatment, the risk of post-remission relapse is significant. Although the effectiveness of low-intensity interventions for treating primary symptoms of psychological difficulties has been extensively evaluated, there has been significantly less research examining the use of these interventions as a relapse prevention strategy OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using psychological or psychosocial interventions low-intensity to prevent relapse or recurrence in patients with depression Because the broader definition of “low-intensity” psychological intervention is somewhat controversial, the review was conducted in two parts: A, a systematic review of all assessments of “low-intensity” interventions ' conducted by para-professionals, peer supporters or psychological well-being practitioners in terms of improving access to the psychological therapy program; and B, a scoping review of relevant evaluations of interventions involving qualified mental health professionals (e.g., psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, cognitive-behavioural therapists) that involved < 6 hours of contact per patient. DATA SOURCES: Extensive literature reviews were developed; electronic databases were searched from inception through September 2010 (including MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library), Internet resources were used to identify depression treatment guidelines and the bibliographies of relevant reviews, guidelines and included studies were questioned. REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts; Data were independently extracted by one reviewer using a standardized data extraction form and verified by another. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus, involving a third reviewer where necessary. Inclusion criteria were population - adults or adolescents who had received treatment for depression; Intervention – Part A, low-intensity interventions, specifically any unsupported psychological/psychosocial interventions or any supported interventions that did not involve highly qualified mental health professionals, and Part B, interventions delivered by qualified mental health professionals and less than 6 hours of contact per patient; comparator - any, including no treatment, placebo, psychological or pharmacological interventions; Outcomes - relapse or recurrence, other outcomes (e.g., social functioning, quality of life) were recorded if reported; and study design - randomized, quasi-randomized and non-randomized studies with concurrent control patients for clinical efficacy. For cost-effectiveness, full economic assessments comparing two or more treatment options, considering both costs and consequences. No study met the inclusion criteria for Part A. RESULTS: For the review of clinical efficacy, 17 studies (14 completed, three ongoing) reported in 27 publications met the inclusion criteria of Part B. These studies were clinically and methodologically diverse and reported about different degrees of effectiveness for the evaluated interventions. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a collaborative care program was potentially relevant to Part A; This study reported no difference between patients receiving the intervention and those receiving usual care in terms of depression recurrence over a 12-month period. For the cost-benefit review, two studies met the criteria for Part B. One was an economic assessment of the RCT above that was potentially relevant for Part A. This assessment concluded that the intervention can be a cost-effective application of resources compared to usual care; However, it was unclear how valid these estimates were for the NHS. LIMITATIONS: Although any definition of ""short"" is likely to be somewhat arbitrary, an inclusion threshold of 6 hours of contact per patient was used to select short high-intensity intervention studies. Most excluded studies clearly evaluated resource-intensive interventions, although occasionally studies were excluded based on just a little over 6 hours of contact per patient. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to determine the clinical efficacy or cost-effectiveness of low-intensity interventions in preventing depression recurrence or recurrence. A scoping review of short, high-intensity therapies shows that some approaches have shown promise in some studies, but the results have not been consistent. Many uncertainties remain and more primary research is required. The scope of such research should be carefully considered; It is important to evaluate the broader patient pathway that takes into account the heterogeneous patient populations of interest. Future RCTs conducted in a UK primary care setting should include adult participants in remission or recovery from depression and, where appropriate, assess the quality of the intervention and consistency of delivery by all practitioners. The incidence of recurrence or recurrence should be measured using established methods, and functional outcomes and symptoms should be measured.” Quality of life data using a generic instrument such as FUNDING: The Health Technology Assessment Program of the National Institutes for Health Research.",0,0,

Aim To assess the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of screening HIV-positive gay and bisexual men for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) and anal SCC. Design Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective using reference case recommendations from the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. A state-transition Markov model was developed to calculate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy without screening versus multiple screening strategies for ASIL and anal SCC using anal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests at different intervals . Scores for incidence, progression, and regression of anal neoplasia"", effectiveness of screening and treatment, natural history of HIV, health-related quality of life;"" and costs were taken from the literature. Setting and Participants Hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men living in the United States. Main outcome measures Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years saved, lifetime cost and incremental cost-benefit ratio. Results Screening for ASIL increased quality-adjusted life expectancy at all stages of HIV disease. Screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years starting with early HIV disease (CD4 count > 0.50 × 109/L) resulted in a 2.7-month improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy with an additional cost-benefit Ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Annual screening with anal Pap tests offered additional benefits at an additional cost of $16,600 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. If screening was initiated later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count < 0.50 × 109/L), then annual Pap test screening was preferred due to the greater number of prevalent anal disorders (cost-effectiveness of less than $25,000 saved per quality-adjusted life-year compared to no screening). Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit over annual screening. The results were most sensitive to the rate of progression from ASIL to anal SCC and the effectiveness of treatment of precancerous lesions. Conclusions Screening HIV-positive gay and bisexual men for ASIL and anal SCC with anal Pap testing offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to other accepted clinical preventive interventions.",0,0,
1740,The clinician-examiner: unavoidable but controllable tension,"The ""difference position"" states that clinical research and therapeutic medical practice are sufficiently different activities to require different ethical rules and principles. The ""similarity position"" instead states that clinical investigators should be bound by the same fundamental principles that govern therapeutic medicine - specifically, a duty to provide each patient or subject with the optimal therapeutic benefit. Some defenders of the similarity position defend it because of the overlap between the treating physician's role and the investigator's role in a research trial. This overlap is at a maximum when the same physician fills both roles in relation to a particular patient subject. We address the ethical tensions inherent in this role conflict, arguing that the tensions are real but manageable. The difference position provides a solid ethical framework within which to manage these tensions, while the similarity position is unsatisfactory because it attempts to deny the existence of the tensions.",0,0,

1742,The Colorado Asthma Toolkit Program: a practice coaching intervention from the High Plains Research Network,"INTRODUCTION: Asthma is often underdiagnosed and undertreated in primary care. The Colorado Asthma Toolkit program was initiated to establish a method for improving asthma care by providing primary care practices with coaching, training, and support for (1) evidence-based asthma diagnosis and treatment, and (2) educating and enabling patients to use effective treatment are offered self-management of their illness. METHODS: A collaborative program was initiated involving two academic medical institutions and the High Plains Research Network, a practice-based primary care research network in eastern Colorado. Focus groups were conducted with rural Colorado patients and health care physicians to assess needs and determine the most effective intervention strategies. Two intertwined training programs or 'toolkits' were then developed, one each for physicians and patients. Clinicians received 3 coaching sessions delivered by 2 practice nurses, including training in guideline-based methods for assessing and managing asthma, coaching to support practices in implementing these methods, and training in communication techniques to promote asthma self-management . The practices also received a spirometer and were trained in its use and interpretation. Patient self-management toolkits were provided to clinicians, who were trained to use the materials to educate patients and increase adherence to therapy. The evaluations were based on practical interviews 1 to 3 months after the coaching. RESULTS: Coaching occurred in 57 of the 58 primary care practices in eastern rural and semirural Colorado. The offices reported changes in their asthma management behavior: (1) 40.4% of offices increased their use of inhaled corticosteroids, with the median percentage of patients using inhaled corticosteroids increasing from 25% to 50%; (2) 53.2% of practices increased their use of inhaled corticosteroids Use of asthma action plans, with the median percentage of patients with action plans increasing from 0% to 20%; and (3) 78.7% of practices started use of spirometry or increased their use, resulting in an increase in mean use from 0% to 30%. CONCLUSION: The Colorado Asthma Toolkit program has successfully disseminated asthma care education to most rural health care practices. The acceptance in the practices was attributed to the flexible coaching in the practice and the provision of spirometry. Significant changes seen in asthma management practices are likely to reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits.",0,0,
1743,The Community Physicians' Network (CPN): a science-community partnership to close health inequalities,"INTRODUCTION: Health care inequalities are perpetuated by three main factors: 1) patient factors, which include multiple risk factors and comorbidities; 2) physician factors, which include inconsistent application of practice guidelines due to a limited database of clinical trials of effective therapies in African Americans and other underrepresented minorities, and 3) barriers in the health care system resulting in poor access to care. The Morehouse School of Medicine Community Physicians' Network (CPN) was formed to address inequalities in healthcare by focusing on provider-specific strategies. OBJECTIVES: To: 1) use disease-specific registries to identify treatment gaps and facilitate quality improvement processes between CPN practices; 2) develop practice-specific and guideline-based educational messages to promote quality care; 3) Engage and train CPN physicians to participate in approved NIH, other government, and industry-supported clinical protocols; and 4) Developing a data archive of all CPN-sponsored clinical trials that include significant numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented minorities. METHODS: The disease-specific outpatient registries will have the following features: 1) data structures and data elements will use standard database codes and a data dictionary; 2) HIPPA compliant data abstraction and data transfer tool; 3) Review of baseline plots to establish practice patterns and provide practice-specific feedback; 4) annual update of the register; 5) Data registration and storage maintained on Morehouse School of Medicine's secure servers; 6) Register publications contain only aggregated data, without identification of contributing practices; 7) An Electronic Health Records platform will be promoted as the ultimate data management tool for CPN practices. In addition, up to three Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs are conducted each year with national speakers and evidence-based practice guidelines are promoted. RESULTS: 85 primary care and subspecialty practices are actively enrolled in CPN with a total of 385,000 outpatient visits per year. The composition of insurance status is: HMO/PPO (45%); Medicare only (19%); Medicare HMO (11%); Medicare plus (8%); Medicaid (6%); “Not insured” (11%). CONCLUSIONS: The Community Physicians' Network will fill specific gaps in healthcare for African American and other minority patients by promoting quality care among its members and facilitating participation in approved clinical trials. The unique partnership with the academic community is consistent with the goal of the NIH roadmap to eliminate inequalities in health care.",0,0,

Objective To assess the impact of expanded ART, HIV screening, or interventions on the US HIV epidemic to reduce risk behavior.DesignDynamic mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression, and cost-benefit analysis.Data sourcesPublished literature.Target populationHigh-risk individuals ( injectors, men who have sex with men) and low-risk individuals aged 15 to 64 in the US 20-year time horizon and lifetime (costs and QALYs).PerspectiveSociety.InterventionsExpanded HIV screening and counseling, treatment with ART or both.Outcome measuresNew HIV infections, reduced costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Outcomes Base-case analysisOne-time HIV screening of low-risk individuals coupled with annual screening of high-risk individuals could 6,7 % of p predicted to prevent 1.23 million new infections and cost $22,382/QALY assuming a 20% reduction in sexual activity after screening. Extending ART use to 75% of eligible individuals prevents 10.3% of infections and costs $20,300/QALY gained. A combination strategy prevents 17.3% of infections and costs $21,580/QALY achieved. Results Sensitivity Analysis Without restricting sexual activity, extended screening prevented 3.7% of infections. Earlier ART initiation, when CD4>350 cells/mL, prevents 20–28% of infections. Additional efforts to halve high-risk behaviors could reduce infections by 65%.LimitationsSimplified model of disease progression and treatment"";"" Exclusion of acute HIV screening.

1747,"The cost, clinical utility, and cost-effectiveness of screening for cervical cancer in HIV-infected women","Background: HIV-infected women are at higher risk of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions than non-HIV-infected women, and the optimal regimen for screening for cervical cancer in these women is uncertain. Aim: To evaluate the net health consequences, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for cervical neoplasia and cancer in HIV-infected women. Design: A cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective conducted using a state-transition Markov model. Incidence, progression, and regression scores of cervical neoplasia""; effectiveness of screening and treatment; progression of HIV disease; mortality from HIV infection and cancer; quality of life;"" and costs were taken from the literature. Setting: Simulated clinical practice in the United States. Patients: HIV-infected females representative of the US population. Intervention: Six main screening strategies, no screening, annual Papanicolaou smears, annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears 6 months apart (recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), biannual Papanicolaou smears, annual colposcopy, and six-monthly colposcopy were taken into account. Effectiveness. Results: Annual Papanicolaou swab screening resulted in a 2.1-month improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy at an additional cost of $12,800 per QALY saved. Annual Papanicolaou swab screening after two negative swabs 6 months apart yielded an additional 0.04 QALYs at a cost of $14,800 per QALY saved. The biannual Papanicolaou swab screening provided an additional 0.17 QALYs at a cost of $27,600 per QALY saved. Annual colposcopy cost more but provided no additional benefit compared to biannual Papanicolaou swab screening, and biannual colposcopy exceeded $375,000 per QALY saved. The results were most sensitive to the rate of progression from neoplasia to invasive cancer. Conclusions: In HIV-infected women, cervical cancer screening with annual Papanicolaou smears after two negative smears 6 months apart provides quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to other clinical preventive interventions.",0,0,
1748,The current situation of health research and ethics in Sudan,"At the beginning of the 20th century, health research in Sudan developed primarily as a function of the British colonial administration. Ethical issues in the medical profession in Sudan are regulated by the Sudan Medical Council. To address these issues, the Sudan Medical Council issued medico-legal and ethical guidelines in 1967. This important document mainly focuses on ethical issues that arise in clinical medicine. In the history of health research in Sudan, it is very difficult to relate to research ethics. Nevertheless, there have been some attempts to articulate ethics in health research. In 1979, Sudan witnessed the establishment of the first Ethics Committee, formed at the initiative of a group of doctors and scientists from the National Health Research Laboratory. This committee found neither political nor institutional recognition. Therefore, it was not developed and ended shortly after its introduction. However, in 2000 FMOH established an Ethical Review Committee (ERC). The role of this committee was to review, independently of the funders, ethical research proposals for health research to be conducted in the country. Unfortunately, the committee dedicated all tasks to reviewing only externally funded health research and research conducted by foreign researchers or international organizations.",0,0,
1749,Demonstrating a theory-based approach to designing localized patient safety interventions.,"Background There is evidence of insecure care in healthcare systems worldwide. Interventions to implement recommended practice often have modest and variable impacts. Ideally, selecting and tailoring interventions to local contexts should enhance impact. However, the means by which this can be done are rarely systematic, theory-based, or made transparent. This work aimed to demonstrate the applicability, feasibility and acceptability of a Theory Domains Framework Implementation (TDFI) approach for the collaborative design of patient safety interventions. Methods We worked with three hospitals to support the implementation of evidence-based guidelines to reduce the risk of feeding from misplaced gastric tubes. Our staged process, based on the TDF and key principles from the implementation literature, included: stakeholder engagement, identifying target behaviors, identifying local factors (barriers and levers) influencing behavior change, using a TDF-based questionnaire, collaborating with Stakeholders to provide specific local strategies to overcome key barriers and support stakeholders in implementing strategies Exit interviews and audit data collection were conducted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of this approach Results After review and discussion, the implementation teams for each trust identified the Pre-feed feeding tube verification process as a key target behavior Questionnaire results revealed differences in key barriers between organizations. Focus groups developed innovative, generalized Buildable and customizable strategies to overcome obstacles, such as z rces. Exit interviews identified issues related to the benefits, challenges and sustainability of this approach. Time-trend audit data were collected for 301 patients over an 18-month period for one trust, suggesting clinically significant improved application of pH and documentation of practice post-intervention. Conclusions The TDF is a practical and acceptable framework to guide the implementation of patient safety interventions. The tiered TDFI approach engages health professionals and facilitates contextualization in identifying target behaviors, identifying local barriers, and selecting strategies to overcome those barriers. This approach may be of use to implementation teams and policy makers, although our promising results confirm the need for more rigorous assessment; a balanced block evaluation is currently underway.",0,1,
1750,Design and evaluation of a graphical representation for laboratory data,"Objective Advances in healthcare information technology have created ways to represent data in new, more effective ways. In this study, we designed a laboratory display containing small, high-density graphics called sparklines, which have recently been promoted as effective representations of medical data but have not been well studied. The impact of this novel display on how physicians interpret data was studied. Design Twelve physicians chatted loudly as they reviewed laboratory data from four patients in a pediatric intensive care unit using the chart display and a traditional spreadsheet display. Measurements verbalizations were coded based on the abnormal values and trends identified for each laboratory variable. The consistency of interpretations of variables in each display was evaluated, and patterns were examined between participants. The evaluation time was also analyzed. Results Physicians completed assessments significantly faster using the graphical display (3.6 min vs. 4.4 min, p=0.042). When comparing between displays, 37% of interpretations disagreed. Charts were more useful when the visual cues in tables did not provide trend information, while slightly abnormal values were easier to identify with tables. Conclusions Data presentation format can affect how physicians interpret laboratory data. Graphic displays have several advantages over numeric displays, but are not always optimal. User, task and data characteristics should be considered when designing information displays.",0,1,
1751,The development of an intervention to promote adherence to national guidelines for suspected viral encephalitis,"BACKGROUND: Central nervous system infections can have devastating clinical consequences if not timely diagnosed and treated. There is a documented gap between recommended and actual practice and limited understanding of its causes. We have identified and investigated the reasons for this gap, focusing on points in the patient's care pathway most amenable to change and developing a tailored intervention strategy to improve diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Using theory-based, semi-structured interviews, we investigated barriers and options for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with suspected encephalitis, specifically performing lumbar puncture and initiating antiviral therapy within 6 hours. We deliberately sampled hospitals and hospital staff in the UK. We recorded and transcribed all interviews prior to scoping analysis. We have mapped identified barriers and enablers for the patient journey. We matched behavior change techniques targeting clinicians with key barriers and enablers and embedded them in an intervention package. RESULTS: We surveyed 43 staff in six hospitals. Clinical staff expressed uncertainty about when and how spinal taps should be performed and pointed out practical difficulties in performing them in a busy clinical setting. Once the need for treatment was triggered, clinicians generally felt able to take appropriate therapeutic action, albeit within organizational and resource constraints. Adapted behavior modification techniques have largely targeted the history of treatment. This included decision support for quick detection, showing the consequences of missed diagnoses for clinicians and patients, and practical support for spinal taps. We then developed an evidence-based package that includes “core” interventions and, to allow for local flexibility, “optional” interventions. CONCLUSIONS: We identified several points in the patient pathway where practice could be improved, with the most critical point being clinical suspicion and initial assessment. Interventions that target professional beliefs and behaviors while optimizing their clinical setting have been among the most promising approaches to improving care for suspected encephalitis.

1753,The development of evidence-based psychotherapy for use in alcoholism. a review,"In the last few decades, tremendous progress has been made in the development and validation of evidence-based approaches to the psychotherapy of alcoholism. While psychoanalytic and early behavioral techniques were the original foundation of psychotherapy in this area, evidence-based approaches today build on the principles of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy. Various techniques have been developed to modify antecedent and ongoing conditions that favor problem behaviors, e.g. B. Training in coping/social skills and the community empowerment approach. According to the results of the MATCH project, one of the largest treatment studies, the ""cognitive behavioral intervention"" combines motivational enhancement therapy, the 12-step approach and cognitive behavioral therapy with the aim of providing a new and even more effective psychotherapy for alcohol-dependent patients. However, these promising developments are fraught with major problems in that only a few of the new evidence-based treatment approaches are accepted as standard treatment in Germany and, moreover, only a fraction of all alcohol dependents in this country make it into the care system, for various reasons. Early diagnosis and facilitating access to the different treatment options available could be a future task for general practitioners and also for occupational health systems.",0,0,
1754,The dirty dozen: 12 sources of bias in forensic neuropsychology with ways to mitigate.,"The ever-growing role of a forensic neuropsychologist in civil litigation has rightly led to higher expectations of this expert in areas such as clinical and forensic knowledge, objectivity, and the usefulness of the work product. It is the responsibility of the forensic neuropsychologist to ensure that these expectations are met. Given that biases are inherent in clinical and forensic work, it is imperative that in high-stakes situations such as forensic neuropsychological assessment, the assessor proactively and conscientiously recognize and minimize the impact of these biases. This article highlights 12 of many common biases that the prudent forensic neuropsychologist should always consider when evaluating, as well as making statements or process statements. Role, cognitive and practice bias are defined and illustrated with examples. Concrete suggestions for recognizing and reducing these prejudices are taken from both empirical literature and forensic experience. The information contained in this article is intended to provide sound and practical strategies that may be useful to forensic neuropsychology practitioners.

1755,The economy-wide impact of pandemic influenza in the UK: a computable general equilibrium modeling experiment,"OBJECTIVES To assess the potential economic impact of an influenza pandemic, associated behavioral responses, school closures and vaccination in the UK. DESIGN A computable general equilibrium model of the UK economy was specified for various combinations of mortality and morbidity from pandemic influenza, vaccine effectiveness, school closures and prophylactic absenteeism using published data. SETTING The UK Economy 2004 (the most recent data available with appropriate economic data). KEY OUTCOME MEASURES The economic impact of different scenarios with different severity of the pandemic, vaccination, school closures and prophylactic absenteeism, given in terms of gross domestic product, the performance of different economic sectors and corresponding fluctuations. RESULTS The cost of disease alone ranged from 0.5% to 1.0% of gross domestic product (£8.4bn to £16.8bn) for low death scenarios, 3.3% and 4.3% (55, £5bn to £72.3bn) for high-fat scenarios, and even larger for an extreme pandemic. School closures increase the economic impact, especially during mild pandemics. If widespread behavior change occurs and large-scale prophylactic absence from work occurs, the economic impact would be significantly increased with small health benefits. Vaccination with a prepandemic vaccine could save 0.13% to 2.3% of gross domestic product ($2.2bn to $38.6bn);"" and two doses of a matched vaccine could reduce the overall economic impact to about 1% for all disease scenarios % of gross domestic product CONCLUSION Balancing school closures with business as usual and obtaining adequate supplies of effective vaccines are more important factors in determining the economic impact of an influenza pandemic than the disease itself increase significantly.",0,0,
1756,The EDUCATE study: an exemplary further education example for the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice,"Cancer care is evolving from a solitary practitioner delivery system based on tradition and anecdotal experience to a multidisciplinary, collaborative, science-based paradigm. Evidence-based practice enables optimal quality of care for cancer patients and is achieved for medical and nursing practitioners through the implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Clinical education based on the principles of adult education is a method of implementing clinical practice guidelines in clinical practice. However, research shows that traditional static parenting methods do little to change behavior"";"" Instead, effective education involves interactive formats, provides feedback, and incorporates reminder and reinforcement strategies.

1757,The effect of a computerized reminder system on the prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism,"Study objective To measure the effect of a modified treatment process guided by a computerized reminder system on the rates of symptomatic postoperative venous thromboembolism. Design comparisons of preinterventional and postinterventional measurements. Setting A university-affiliated community hospital in Utah. Patients Two thousand seventy-seven consecutive patients who underwent major surgery between January 1, 1997 and October 31, 1997 (prior to the intervention) in four surgical departments and 2,093 consecutive patients who underwent between January 1, 1998 and October 31, 1998 had undergone the same interventions ,1998 (after intervention). Intervention A venous thromboembolism prevention program developed using guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and a modified workflow driven by a computerized reminder system. Measurements Rates of symptomatic, objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and death from venous thromboembolism occurring within 90 days of the date of surgery. Results The preintervention and postintervention cohorts did not differ in terms of age, disease severity, number of risk factors for venous thromboembolism, or individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The overall prophylaxis rate increased from 89.9% before introduction of the computerized reminder system to 95.0% after introduction (p < 0.0001). The 90-day combined rate of symptomatic DVT, PE, and death due to PE remained the same (pre-intervention 1.0%; post-intervention 1.2%; odds ratio 1.21; 95% CI: 0.67 to 2.20). Forty of 46 venous thromboembolic complications (87%) occurred despite American College of Chest Physicians-recommended venous thromboembolic prevention measures. Conclusions Computerized reminder systems combined with modified care regimens increase the rate of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism without reducing the rate of symptomatic venous thromboembolism when the baseline rate of prophylaxis is high. There is a population of surgical patients who are resistant to prophylactic measures for venous thromboembolism recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians. New strategies are needed to address prophylaxis-resistant venous thromboembolism.",1,1,
1758,The effect of a mobile clinical decision support system on the diagnosis of obesity and overweight in acute and primary care settings.,"The purpose of the study was to compare the proportion of obesity-related diagnoses in clinical encounters (N=1874) documented by nurses using a personal digital assistant-based protocol with and without obesity decision support features. The experimental group encounters in the randomized controlled trial had significantly more (P=0.000) obesity-related diagnoses (11.3%) than the control group encounters (1%) and a significantly lower false-negative rate (24.5% versus 66.5%, P=0.000). The study results demonstrate that the integration of a decision support function that automatically calculates an obesity-related diagnosis increases diagnoses and decreases missed diagnoses, and suggest that such systems have the potential to improve the quality of obesity-related care. Obesity and overweight pose a public health challenge and are the target of public health prevention goals in the United States.1 Obesity and overweight have been underestimated as diseases, resulting in many obese patients not receiving appropriate interventions.2 ,3 Prevention and treatment of obesity and overweight involves a complex and dynamic set of processes,4 and the integration of relevant evidence into practice is required to improve obesity management.5,6 Clinical practice guidelines can be used as a tool for providing an evidence-based serve practice”; However, few studies have been conducted involving nurses, and methodological problems limit the generalizability of their results.7 Although advanced nurses have the potential to play a central role in the prevention and treatment of obesity and overweight, there is little empirical evidence for their adherence to guidelines, and therefore research is needed to explore effective strategies to support policy implementation.8 The purpose of this study was to compare the proportion of obesity-related diagnoses (obesity and overweight) in clinical encounters that were associated with an on A personal digital assistant-based clinical decision support system compared to a personal digital assistant-based clinical protocol without obesity decision support capabilities.",0,1,
1759,The effect of a patient-centered treatment bundle intervention on pressure ulcer incidence (INTACT): A cluster-randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers are a serious patient safety issue associated with poor patient outcomes and high healthcare costs. They are also used as an indicator of the quality of care. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pressure ulcer prevention package in preventing hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in at-risk patients. DESIGN: Pragmatic cluster-randomized study. SETTING: Eight tertiary referral hospitals, each with >200 beds, in three Australian states. PARTICIPANTS: 1600 patients (200/hospital) were recruited. Patients were eligible if they were: >/=18 years old; were at risk of pressure ulcers due to reduced mobility; expected to stay >/=48 hours in the hospital and be able to read English. METHODS: Hospitals (clusters) were stratified into two strata groups according to recent pressure ulcer rates and randomized within strata to receive either a pressure ulcer prevention treatment package or standard care. The treatment package was theoretically and empirically based on patient involvement and clinical practice guidelines. It consisted of several components and contained three messages for patients. Participating in Pressure Ulcer Prevention: Keep Moving, Take Care of Your Skin and Eat Healthy Patient training tools included a DVD, brochure and poster Nurses in intervention hospitals were trained to work with patients on their pressure ulcer prevention. The statisticians, recruiters, and outcome evaluators were blinded to group assignment, and the interventionists were good to the study hypotheses tested at both the cluster and patient levels. The primary outcome, the incidence of hospital-acquired pressure ulcers, which was true at both the cluster and individual participant levels, was measured by daily skin inspection. RESULTS: Four clusters were randomized to each group, and 799 patients per group were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.035. After adjusting for clustering and pre-determined covariates (age, pressure ulcer present at baseline, body mass index, reason for admission, place of residence, and number of comorbidities at admission), the hazard ratio developed for new pressure ulcers (pressure ulcer prevention care package relative to standard of care) was 0, 58 (95% CI: 0.25, 1.33; p=0.198). No adverse events or harm were reported. There was a high degree of uncertainty around this estimate and the difference was not statistically significant. Possible explanations for this non-significant result are that the care package was effective in preventing pressure ulcers, but the sample size was too small to tell.",0,0,
1760,The impact of adding pap smear information to a mammography reminder system in an HMO: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"Background While reminders can enhance cancer prevention in primary care, little is known about the possible interaction between multiple reminders. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of combined Pap smear plus mammography reminders and mammography reminders in 2471 women aged 40 years or older enrolled in a healthcare organization that had a predominantly Medicaid eligible population. The reminders included both a mailed letter for the woman and a request for medical records. Results Intervention assignment was not associated with differences in the frequency of visits to primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists or completion of a mammogram during the academic year. Compared to women assigned to mammography reminder treatment alone, those assigned to the combined Pap smear plus mammography reminder intervention were more likely to visit a gynecologist (34% vs. 29%, adjusted odds ratio = 1, 33, 95% confidence interval 1.08). ""1.63) and to perform a Pap smear (30% vs. 23%, adjusted odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.89). Conclusions Within the study, the addition of a Pap smear to mammography reminders has a procedure-specific effect that increases OB visits and Pap smear use, while neither increasing nor decreasing other primary care visits or mammography. We find no evidence of reinforcement or competition between these memories.",0,1,
1761,The effect of computer reminders on general practitioner prescribing behavior: a cluster-randomized study,"OBJECTIVE: Despite the development and dissemination of guidelines, it is difficult to control the prescribing behavior of drugs in general practitioners' practices. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect on drug prescribing behavior through the implementation of prescribing guidelines using a computer reactive reminder system (CRS). DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial with incomplete block design in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received antibiotic and asthma/COPD prescription reminders, 28 GP (7 GP practices) received cholesterol prescription reminders. Prescription guidelines were integrated into the computer-assisted general practitioner information system. MEASUREMENTS: Both performance indicators and prescription volume were calculated as key outcome measures. In addition to the individual volume measurement, total values for the volume measurements per drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD and cholesterol) were formed. RESULTS: The variation between primary care physicians turned out to be larger and more biased than expected. No differences were found between the groups for indicators and volumes related to recommendations for endorsement of specific drugs. Although clinically relevant results tended to be recorded with supposedly decreasing prescription quantities, the difference in the total score between the groups was not significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that should decrease, the total score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8–44.5) prescriptions per 1000 patients per general practitioner, for the control it was 39.7 (95% CI : 29.7-64.1). group (p0.2). For asthma/COPD prescriptions that should decrease, the total score for the intervention group was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6–2.6) prescriptions per 1000 patients per general practitioner, for the prescriptions it was 2.2 ( 95% CI: 1.4-4.3). the control group (p 0.1). Significant differences were found for three specific recommendations (on quinolones for cystitis, corticosteroids for CPOD, and antibiotics for acute sore throat). CONCLUSIONS: This study proved to be underpowered due to the large differences in prescribing behavior between physicians. Nevertheless, computer-assisted reminders sometimes have a favorable effect on the restriction of certain medications that are not or no longer indicated in the general practitioner's practice.",1,1,
1762,The effect of educational intervention on the acquisition of medical diagnoses in residents,"INTRODUCTION: Studies indicate that the use of interventions, including education, can improve medical record documentation and reduce incomplete records. Because physicians play a critical role in documenting medical records, the researchers intend to examine the effect of educational interventions on physician performance and knowledge of the principles of recording medical diagnoses among residents of the Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2010 on 40 medical specialists (internal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, anesthesiology and surgery) at the Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences. During a workshop, guidelines for collecting diagnostic information related to the respective specialty were given. Before and after the intervention, five medical records were selected from each resident to assess the physician's record keeping performance. The knowledge of the physicians before and after the intervention was surveyed by means of a questionnaire. The data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: The change in physician knowledge before and after training was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). The behavior of the residents did not change statistically significantly in three phases of the study. CONCLUSION: The diversity of related factors contributing to the quality of documentation compels a portfolio of strategies to improve medical records. Employing a combination of best practice efforts, including training physicians from the start of the internship and applying a targeted strategy that focuses on problem areas and existing gaps, can improve physician record keeping behaviors.",0,0,

The CHF quality indicators were assessed and quality managers were interviewed at start-up and re-measurement. No significant changes in quality indicators were found as a result of either intervention. 78% of the quality managers stated that the implementation of hospital projects only started shortly before the re-evaluation. HII quality managers found the CHF project to be significantly more successful compared to LII quality managers (63% versus 13%, P<0.01). Evaluating the impact of external feedback on practice behavior requires sufficient time for organizational and individual clinical changes. Liaison doctors can play a role in facilitating this change.",0,1,
1764,The effect of mobile phone SMS reminders on adherence to malaria treatment guidelines by Kenyan health workers: a randomized cluster study,"Background Health care workers' malaria case management practices often deviate from national guidelines. We assessed whether SMS reminders sent to healthcare workers' mobile phones could improve and maintain their adherence to treatment guidelines for outpatient pediatric malaria in Kenya. Methods From March 6, 2009 to May 31, 2010, we conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 107 rural health facilities in 11 districts in coastal and western Kenya. Using a computer-generated sequence, health facilities were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, in which all health workers received malaria case management text messages on their personal mobile phones for 6 months, or the control group, in which health workers received no text messages. Healthcare workers were not masked at the intervention, although patients did not know whether they were in an intervention or control facility. The primary outcome was correct treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, defined as a dichotomous composite indicator of treatment, delivery and counseling tasks in accordance with Kenyan national guidelines. The primary analysis was by treatment intent. The study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, ISRCTN72328636. Results 119 health workers received the intervention. Case management practices were evaluated for 2269 children requiring treatment (1157 in the intervention group and 1112 in the control group). The intention-to-treat analysis showed that correct artemether-lumefantrine management improved by 23 7 percentage points (95% CI 7 6-40 0"", p=0 004) immediately after the intervention and by 24 5 percent improved scores (8 1-41 0;"" p=0 003) 6 months later. Interpretation In resource-constrained settings, malaria control programs should consider the use of text messaging to improve health care workers' case management practices.",1,1,
1765,The effect of orthodontic referral guidelines: a randomized controlled trial,"AIM: To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of referral guidelines for referring orthodontic patients to specialist and orthodontic specialists. DESIGN: Single center randomized controlled trial with random assignment of orthodontic treatment referral guidelines to general dentists. SETTING: Orthodontic departments in hospitals and specialist orthodontic practices in Manchester and Stockport. TOPICS: General dentists and the patients they refer for orthodontic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Adequacy of referral, defined as if the patient was accepted for orthodontic treatment. RESULTS: The referral policies did not reduce the number of inappropriate referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Referral guidelines for orthodontic referrals had no impact on general dentist behavior. Further research is needed on the optimal methods for disseminating and implementing referral guidelines for use in general dental care.",0,0,
1766,The effect of register-based performance feedback via short text messages and traditional postal letters on general practitioner prescribing of parenteral steroids--a randomized controlled trial,"Background It is believed that providing feedback on physician prescribing behavior improves the quality of drug prescribing. However, the effectiveness of providing feedback and the manner in which feedback is conveyed is not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of traditional paper letter (TPL) and short text message (STM) feedback on general practitioner prescribing behavior for parenteral steroids (PS). Methods In a single-blind, randomized, controlled study, 906 general practitioners (GPs) with at least 10 monthly prescriptions were randomized into two intervention and one control arm with 1:1 assignment, stratified by percentage of prescriptions. The intervention consisted of providing 3 feedback messages with prescription indices in TPL and STM (in the first two arms) compared to the control arm (CG) with an interval of 3 months between these messages. We calculated the defined PS daily dose (DDD) for each GP each month and compared between the 3 arms before and after the interventions. The expected primary outcome was a reduction in the participants' prescription of parenteral steroids. The study was conducted at the Kerman Social Security Organization in Iran. Results A total of 906 general practitioners were selected for the study, but only 721 of them (TPL = 191, STM = 228, CG = 302) were recruited for the 1st feedback. The mean age of the general practitioners was 44 years and 59% of them were male. Prescribed parenteral steroid DDDs at baseline were similar (TPL = 121.62, STM = 127.49, CG = 115.68, P > 0.5). At the end of the study, the DDDs in the TPL and STM arms were similar (TPL = 104.38, STM = 101.90, P > 0.9), but the DDDs in each intervention arm were statistically significantly lower than in CG ( CG = 156.17, P<0.0001). ). Being in the TPL and STM arms resulted in a reduction in DDD of 36.1 and 41.7 units, respectively, compared to the control arm at the one-year study period (P<0.02 and P<0.005). Conclusion Feedback from TPLs and STMs on prescribing performance effectively reduced the prescribing of PSs by GPs. STM is a cheap and fast tool and potentially powerful and efficient for streamlining drug prescribing.",1,1,

Data source Nationwide relief database. Study design Randomized controlled trial of a decision support system for 7412 adults with diabetes and their 64 general practitioners. Data Collection/Data Extraction Charges and data for hospital admissions and emergency room care in Vermont during a mean follow-up of 32 months. Data from New York hospitals were not available. Results Patients randomized to VDIS had fewer hospital admissions than controls (0.17 admissions vs. 0.20 in; p=0.01) and incurred lower hospital charges ($3,113 vs. $3,480; p=0.019) . VDIS patients also had fewer emergency department occupancy rates (0.27 visits versus 0.36; P<0.0001) and charges ($304 versus $414; P<0.0001). The intervention was particularly effective in males and older subjects. Conclusions Despite data limitations that tended to reduce the apparent effect of the system, this randomized controlled trial showed that VDIS reduces hospital admissions and emergency department utilization and costs.",0,1,
1768,The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of dark chocolate consumption as a preventive therapy in people at high risk for cardiovascular disease: best-case scenario analysis using a Markov model,"OBJECTIVE To model the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of daily dark chocolate consumption in a population with metabolic syndrome and high risk of cardiovascular disease. DESIGN Best case scenario analysis using a Markov model. SETTING Australian Study of Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle. PARTICIPANTS 2013 People with hypertension who met criteria for metabolic syndrome, with no history of cardiovascular disease and not on antihypertensive therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Treatment effects related to dark chocolate consumption, derived from published meta-analyses, were used to determine the absolute number of cardiovascular events with and without treatment. The costs associated with cardiovascular events and treatments were used to determine the potential amount of funding needed for dark chocolate therapy to be considered cost-effective. RESULTS Daily consumption of dark chocolate (polyphenol content equivalent to 100 g dark chocolate) can reduce cardiovascular events by 85 (95% confidence interval 60 to 105) per 10,000 treated population over 10 years. $40 (£25; $31; $42) per person per year could be inexpensively spent on dark chocolate prevention strategies. These results assume 100% compliance and represent a best-case scenario. CONCLUSIONS The blood pressure and cholesterol-lowering effects of dark chocolate consumption are beneficial in preventing cardiovascular events in a population with metabolic syndrome. Daily consumption of dark chocolate could be an effective cardiovascular prevention strategy in this population.",0,0,
1769,The Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Psychological Treatments by Lay Counselors for Harmful and Dependent Drinking and Moderate-to-Severe Depression in Primary Care in India: PREMIUM Study Protocol for Randomized Controlled Trials,"BACKGROUND: The most common psychological causes of the global burden of disease are depression in women and alcohol use disorders in men. A major obstacle to the implementation of evidence-based psychological treatments in primary care in developing countries is the unavailability of qualified human resources. The aim of these studies is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two psychological treatments developed for the treatment of depression and alcohol use disorder in primary care in India. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for randomized parallel group controlled trials (Healthy Activity Program for Moderate to Severe Depression, Alcohol Counseling for Harmful and Addictive Drinking) at eight primary health centers in Goa, India. Adult participants in primary care are assessed for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire and, for males only, for alcohol problems using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Participants who test positive will be invited to participate.” Men who test positive for both disorders will be invited to participate in the Alcohol Counseling study. Those who consent will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either of the two appropriate psychological treatments plus reinforced usual care or reinforced usual care only using a computer-generated matching sequence stratified by primary health center and, for depression, by gender. Improved usual care includes the provision of contextualized World Health Organization guidelines and screening results to primary health center physicians. Treatments are delivered by lay counselors over a maximum period of three months. Primary endpoints are disorder severity and remission rates three months post-treatment Admission and for the Alcohol Counseling study, drinking and the impact of drinking on daily life. Secondary endpoints include disorder severity and remission rates at 12 months, and disability scores, suicidal behavior and economic impact, and cost-effectiveness at 3 and 12 months . 500 participants with depression and 400 participants with harmful alcohol use will be recruited. Primary analyzes will be intention-to-treat. DISCUSSION: These studies may offer a new approach to treating moderate depression and alcohol problems in primary care that is potentially scalable because it relies on delivery from a single pool of lay counselors. STUDY REGISTRATION: Both studies are registered with the International Society for the Registration of Clinical Trials (registration number ISRCTN95149997 for the Healthy Activities Program; registration number ISRCTN76465238 for Counseling for Alcohol Problems).",0,0,
1770,"The effectiveness of a published information pack on the beliefs and behaviors of musculoskeletal practitioners: the UK Chiropractors, Osteopaths, and Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists Low Back Pain Management (COMPLeMENT) randomized study.","STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. AIM: To investigate the effect of a printed information pack on the beliefs and reported behavior of musculoskeletal practitioners (chiropractors, osteopaths and musculoskeletal physiotherapists) related to low back pain (LBP) in the UK. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A significant proportion of UK musculoskeletal practitioners do not follow current LBP guideline recommendations. Methods: A total of 1758 practitioners were randomly assigned to one of the two study arms. A printed information packet with guideline recommendations for LBP management was sent to one arm (n=876) and the other received no intervention (n=882). The primary outcome measure consisted of 3 ""quality indicators"" (activity, work, and bed rest) in relation to a vignette of a patient with LBP in which the responses were dichotomized as either ""guideline-inconsistent"" or ""guideline-inconsistent"". The secondary outcome was practitioners' LBP-related beliefs as measured by the Health Care Providers Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale. Outcomes were measured at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Follow-up at 6 months was 89%. The changes in reported behavior on the quality indicators were as follows: activity, odds ratio (OR), 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.61), and number of patients to be treated (NNT), 19 (15-28 )”; Work , OR 1.35 (1.07–1.70) and NNT 19 (14–29) and bed rest, OR 1.31 (0.97–1.76) and NNT 47 (33–103) The composite NNT for a change from guideline-inconsistent to guideline-consistent behavior on at least one of the 3 quality indicators was 10 (9-14) LBP-related beliefs were significantly improved (P=0.002) in those who were sent the information pack, but only to a small extent (mean difference, 0.884 scale points; 95% confidence interval, 0.319-1.448). CONCLUSION: Printed educational materials can shift LBP-related beliefs and reported behaviors from musculoskeletal practitioners towards practice more in line with guideline recommendations.",0,0,
1771,"The effectiveness of an intervention in improving the delivery of preventive care by community physicians: a study protocol of a multi-baseline, non-randomized study","BACKGROUND: The primary behavioral risks for the most common causes of mortality and morbidity in developed countries are tobacco smoking, poor diet, hazardous alcohol use, and physical inactivity. Evidence, guidelines and guidelines support routine clinical care to avoid these risks in primary care. Despite the potential that community health services offer for the delivery of such care, the limited evidence available suggests that it is delivered at suboptimal levels. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-strategic practice change intervention in improving the routine delivery of preventive care by clinicians in a network of community health services. METHODS/DESIGN: A multiple baseline study will be conducted involving all 56 community health facilities in a single health district in New South Wales, Australia. Facilities are assigned to one of three administratively defined groups. A 12-month practice change intervention will be implemented at all facilities in each group to facilitate clinical risk assessment of eligible clients and the provision of brief physician consultation and referral to those identified as “at risk”. The intervention will be delivered in a non-random order across the three facility groups. For all three facility groups, a repeated cross-sectional measurement of clinical preventive care for four individual risks (smoking, improper diet, risky alcohol consumption and lack of exercise) is carried out continuously over a period of 54 months via telephone interviews. The interviews are conducted with randomly selected clients who have visited a community health facility in the past two weeks. Data collection begins 12 months prior to the implementation of the intervention in the first group and continues for six months after the completion of the intervention in the last group. As a secondary source of data, pre- and post-intervention telephone interviews will be conducted with randomly selected physicians from each facility group to assess reported provision of preventive care and acceptability of the intervention and implementation of the practice change. DISCUSSION: The study will provide novel evidence of the ability to improve the routine delivery of preventive care by clinicians in a network of community health facilities.

1772,The effectiveness of computer reminders to improve quality assessment for point-of-care testing in general practice - a randomized controlled trial,"Background Computer reminders are increasingly being used to improve quality and patient safety. However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different types of memories in different environments. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of computer reminders in improving adherence to a quality assessment scheme for point-of-care testing in general practice. Method The study was conducted as a randomised, controlled, crossover study between general practices in the Danish capital region. The intervention consisted of sending computer reminders (ComRem) to practices that did not follow the guideline recommendations of the split test for hemoglobin and glucose. The practices were randomly divided into two groups. During the first follow-up period, one of the groups received the ComRem intervention together with the general implementation activities (GIA), while the other group received only the GIA. For the second follow-up period, the intervention was switched between the two groups. Results were measured as compliance with the split test procedure. Results A total of 142 practices were randomly assigned to the early intervention group and 144 practices to the late intervention group (the control group in the first follow-up period). In the first intervention phase, the average number of split tests performed in the group receiving ComRem increased from 1.22 to 3.76 (out of eight possible tests), while the average number of split tests in the group receiving the targeting only GIA increased from 1.11 to 2.35 (p=0.0059). A similar memory effect was observed after the crossover. In addition, the temporal developments of the outcome measures showed a strong effect of computer memories beyond the intervention periods. Conclusion There was a significant effect of computer recall on adherence to the quality rating scheme for point-of-care testing. Therefore, computer reminders seem to be useful to support the implementation of relatively simple quality and safety procedures.",1,1,
1773,The effectiveness of computer-aided clinical guidelines in the nursing process: a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines have been developed that aim to improve the quality of care. The implementation of the computerized clinical guidelines (CCG) was supported by the development of computerized clinical decision support systems. This systematic review evaluates the impact of CCG on the treatment process in comparison to non-computerized clinical guidelines. METHODS: Specific features of CCG were investigated through an extensive search of the scientific literature querying electronic databases: Pubmed/Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association of CCG traits with positive effects on the nursing process. RESULTS: 45 items were selected. The logistic model showed that the automatic provision of the electronic version of the recommendation as part of the clinical workflow (odds ratio [OR] = 17.5""; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-193.7) and publication year (OR = 6.7;"" 95% CI: 1.3-34.3) were statistically significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: From the conducted research we can conclude that after the implementation of CCG there are significant improvements in the nursing process. Our results also suggest to clinicians, managers, and other healthcare decision-makers what features of CCG could improve the structure of the computerized system.",0,1,
1774,The effectiveness of interventions to improve laboratory request patterns in primary care physicians: a systematic review,"Background Laboratory testing is an integral part of day-to-day family practice, with approximately 30% of patient interactions resulting in an inquiry. However, research suggests that a large proportion of requests for patient care do not benefit and are avoidable. The aim of this systematic review was to comprehensively search the literature for studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to improve the use of laboratory tests by primary care physicians. Methods A search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Scopus (from beginning to 09/02/14) was performed. The following study designs were considered: systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series analyzes (ITSs). The quality of the studies was assessed using a modified version of the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) checklist. The population of interest were general practitioners. Interventions were considered when they aimed to improve laboratory testing in primary care. The interesting result was a series of laboratory tests. Results A total of 6,166 titles and abstracts were screened, followed by 87 full texts. Of these, 11 articles could be included in the systematic review. These included four RCTs, six CBAs and one ITS study. The types of interventions studied included education, feedback, guidelines, education with feedback, feedback with guidelines, and alternating assignment forms. The quality of the included studies varied, with seven studies classified as having a low risk of bias, three with an unclear risk of bias, and one with a high risk of bias. All but one study found a significant reduction in testing volume after the intervention, with effect sizes ranging from 1.2 to 60%. No meta-analysis was performed due to the heterogeneity. Conclusions Interventions such as educational strategies, feedback and modified test order forms can improve the efficient use of laboratory tests in primary care”; However, the level of evidence is quite low and the quality is poor. The reproducibility of findings from different laboratories is also difficult to determine from the literature. Some standardization of both interventions and outcome measures is required to allow for a formal meta-analysis.",0,1,
1775,"The effectiveness of SPARX, a computer-assisted self-help intervention for adolescents seeking help for depression: randomized controlled non-inferiority study","OBJECTIVE To assess whether a new computer-assisted cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (SPARX, Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic, X-Factor Thoughts) could reduce depressive symptoms in help-seeking adolescents as much or more than usual treatment. DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority study. SETTING 24 Primary health care facilities in New Zealand (youth clinics, general practices and school-based counseling services). PARTICIPANTS 187 adolescents aged 12 to 19 years who sought help for depressive symptoms, were not at greater risk of self-harm and were identified by their GPs as requiring treatment: 94 were allocated to SPARX and 93 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS Computational Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (SPARX) consisting of seven modules delivered over a period of four to seven weeks compared to usual treatment, which mainly includes face-to-face counseling by trained counselors and clinical psychologists. RESULTS The primary outcome was change in score on the Revised Child Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included response and remission on the revised childhood depression rating scale, change scores on the second edition of the Reynolds adolescent depression scale, the mood and emotion questionnaire, the children's Kazdin hopelessness scale, the children's Spence anxiety scale and the pediatric quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaires and overall satisfaction with treatment ratings. RESULTS 94 participants were allocated to SPARX (mean age 15.6 years, 62.8% female) and 93 to treatment as usual (mean age 15.6 years, 68.8% female). 170 adolescents (91%, SPARX n=85, treat-as-usual n=85) were evaluated after the intervention and 168 (90%, SPARX n=83, treat-as-usual n=85) at the time of the three-month follow-up. Per-protocol analyzes (n=143) showed that SPARX was non-inferior to usual care. After the intervention, there was a mean reduction of 10.32 in SPARX and 7.59 in treatment-as-usual in raw scores on the revised childhood depression rating scale (difference between groups 2.73, 95% confidence interval -0.31 to 5.77""; p=0.079). Remission rates were significantly higher in the SPARX arm (n=31, 43.7%) than in the treatment arm (n=19, 26.4%) (difference 17.3%, 95 -% confidence interval 1.6% to 31.8%; P=0.030) and response rates were not significantly different between the SPARX arm (66.2%, n=47) and the treatment arm (58.3%, n = 42) (difference 7.9%, -7.9% to 24%; P = 0.332). All secondary measures supported non-inferiority. Intention-to-treat analyzes confirmed these results. Improvements were maintained at follow-up. The Frequency of adverse events classified as “possibly” or “probably” related to the intervention den, did not differ between the groups (SPARX n = 11; ""Treatment as usual n = 11""). CONCLUSIONS SPARX is a potential alternative to usual treatment for adolescents with depressive symptoms in primary care and could be used to fill some unmet treatment needs.

1776,The effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in adults: protocol for a systematic review,"BACKGROUND: A physically active lifestyle plays a preventive role in the development of various chronic diseases and mental illnesses. Unfortunately, few adults achieve the minimum level of physical activity and spend an inordinate amount of time sedentary. The development of targeted interventions to promote active living among adults is an important public health endeavor. A plausible context to reach adults is in the workplace. This systematic review aims to verify the effectiveness of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior in the workplace. METHODS: An advisory group of practitioners will work in collaboration with the research team to inform the systematic review and knowledge mobilization. Fifteen electronic databases are searched to identify studies examining the effectiveness of workplace interventions on physical activity and physical inactivity. All experimental designs and observational studies (non-experimental intervention studies) that meet the study criteria are included. Studies with generally healthy, employed adult participants are included in the review. Interventions focus on increasing physical activity and/or reducing sedentary behavior from the individual to the policy level. The primary outcome variables are reported or observed physical activity and/or sedentary behavior at work. Secondary outcomes include variables ranging from return on investment to quality of life. Study quality is assessed for risk of bias using the protocol identified in the Cochrane Manual for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and supplemented by the guidelines developed by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care group using RevMan. The quality of the evidence is assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. When appropriate, meta-analyses, forest and crop plots will be used to assess the direction, magnitude, and consistency of the intervention effect in the studies with similar intervention strategies. Further knowledge mobilization activities and products will be developed to support the application of this knowledge in practice. DISCUSSION: This protocol paper describes a systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of different types of workplace interventions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior at work. Working with an advisory group of potential knowledge users throughout the process posits greater use and reach of the information gained from this systematic knowledge user review.

1777,The impact of a postgraduate course on primary care physician opioid prescribing patterns,BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a single palliative care workshop that included information about drug prescribing had an impact on primary care physicians' opioid prescribing patterns in daily practice. Method: The opioid prescription numbers of 68 primary care physicians who took part in the workshop were aggregated from the state health insurance fund's computer system. Prescription numbers one year before and one year after the workshop were compared and a control group of non-participants was included. Results: This study showed a limited effectiveness of a palliative care cancer workshop on GP morphine prescription rates in daily practice. This limited effect was not consistent with the results of a pre- and post-workshop questionnaire assessing the attitudes of the same practitioners. CONCLUSION: A single workshop cannot bring about significant changes in prescribing behavior. Possibilities for further reinforcements are discussed.,0,0,

1780,"The Effects of Maternal Depression, Anxiety, and Perceived Stress During Pregnancy on Preterm Birth: A Systematic Review","BACKGROUND: Experiencing psychological distress such as depression, anxiety, and/or perceived stress during pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth. Clarifying the relationship between exposure and outcome may improve understanding of risk factors for preterm birth and guide future clinical and research practices. AIM: The aim of the present review was to outline the evidence on the risk of preterm birth associated with prenatal depression, anxiety and stress. METHODS: Four electronic database searches were performed to identify quantitative population-based, multicenter cohort studies and randomized controlled trials focused on the association between prenatal depression, anxiety and stress and preterm birth published in English between 1980 and 2013.

Information on study characteristics was extracted"";"" Depression, anxiety, and perceived stress were studied as separate and combined exposures. There is strong evidence that prenatal stress during pregnancy increases the likelihood of preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Complex pathways of significant interactions between depression, anxiety and stress, risk factors and prematurity have been revealed in both direct and indirect ways. The effects of pregnancy stress have been associated with spontaneous but not medically indicated preterm births.

Purpose: To update and expand on a previous review that examined the impact of P4P programs at the physician, group, managerial, or institutional level on the care process and patient outcomes in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Data sources: PubMed from June 2007 to October 2016""; MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Business Economics and Theory, Business Source Elite, Scopus, Faculty of 1000 and Gartner Research from June 2007 to February 2016. Study selection: Studies and observational studies in outpatient and inpatient settings Facilities reporting outcomes of care process, health, or use.Data Extraction:Two investigators extracted data, assessed study quality, and assessed the strength of evidence.Data Synthesis:Of the 69 studies, 58 were in outpatient settings, 52 reported treatment outcomes, and 38 about Patient outcomes.Low-strength evidence suggested that P4P programs in outpatient settings improve pro outcomes of dependency over a short period (2 to 3 years), while data on longer-term effects were limited.Many of the positive studies were conducted in the UK , where the incentives were greater than in the United States. The greatest improvements were seen in areas where output was poor. There was no consistent effect of P4P on mean health outcomes (low-strength evidence) and insufficient evidence to characterize an effect on patient health outcomes. In the hospital setting, there was weak evidence that P4P had little or no impact on patient health outcomes and a positive effect on reducing hospital readmissions. Limitation: Few methodologically rigorous studies; heterogeneous population and program characteristics and incentive goals. Conclusion: Pay-for-performance programs can be associated with improved nursing processes in outpatient settings, but no consistently positive associations with improved health outcomes have been demonstrated in any setting.",0,0,
1782,The impact of pricing information on physician test ordering behavior: Diagnostic test ordering.,"This study evaluated the impact of providing physicians with information about diagnostic test prices on their subsequent test ordering behavior. The study population consisted of 36 second- and third-year residents and 23 clinical educators at three primary care practice centers affiliated with the Department of Family Medicine at Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan. Study participants were asked to review four case studies, each describing a patient with ambiguous symptoms, and to indicate on an attached test order form the tests they would order for each patient. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a group that received test order forms with the prices of diagnostic tests printed on them (pricing information group) or to a group that received test order forms without price information (control group). The study results show that in each of the four cases, the average number of diagnostic tests ordered was significantly lower in the price information group than in the control group. Our results also show an average 31.1 percent reduction in the cumulative cost of ordered tests per patient associated with the provision of pricing information. The feasibility of providing physicians with pricing information on a regular basis is discussed and reviewed in light of other approaches that have been developed to change physician behavior when ordering diagnostic tests.",1,1,
1783,The effectiveness of an automated feedback system for general practitioners,"OBJECTIVE: To develop an automated feedback system that generates comments about non-compliance by General Practitioners (GPs) with accepted practice guidelines for ordering diagnostic tests. Before implementing the automated feedback system into daily practice, we assessed the potential impact of the system on GP test ordering behavior. DESIGN: We used a randomized controlled trial with a balanced block design. SETTING: Five times six participant groups of general practitioners in a computer laboratory setting. INTERVENTION: The GPs reviewed a random sample of 30 claim forms they had filled out earlier in the year. If necessary, they could make changes to the requested tests. Next, the system displayed critical comments about their non-compliance with the guidelines, as reflected in the (updated) application forms. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four randomly selected general practitioners participated. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of diagnostic tests requested (17% with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12-22%) and the proportion of tests ordered that did not meet practice guidelines (39% with 95% CI: 28-51%) dropped due to comments from the automated feedback system.

CONSEQUENCES: Although our experiment cannot predict the magnitude of the actual effect of the automated feedback system in daily practice, the observed effect can be considered as the maximum attainable.",1,1,
1784,The effectiveness of computer reminders for external quality assessment for point-of-care testing in Danish general practice: rationale and methodology for two randomized trials,"BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing (POCT) is increasingly used in general medicine to assist general practitioners (GPs) in managing patients with disease. However, low compliance with quality guidelines regarding split testing procedures among general practitioners was observed in parts of the Capital Region in Denmark. Computer reminders embedded in primary care physicians' electronic medical records (ComRem) may facilitate improved quality control behavior, but more research is needed to determine which types of reminders work and when. The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ComRem to improve adherence to quality guidelines by general practitioners. This article describes the rationale and methods of study that make up this research project. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be conducted in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among general practices in two districts of the Capital Region of Denmark. These districts include a total of 739 general practitioners in 567 practices with a total of 1.1 million patients who are assigned to the practice lists. In the first RCT (RCT A), ComRem is compared with postal dunning letters. In the second RCT (RCT B), ComRem is compared to usual activities (no memories) using a crossover approach. In both studies, results are measured by the number of split tests the lab receives. CONCLUSIONS: This study will add to the knowledge of the effectiveness of ComRem in primary care. Since the study does not examine the perceptions and experiences of general practitioners with regard to ComRem, we will subsequently conduct a qualitative survey on these aspects.

1785,The effectiveness of visual cues to improve hand hygiene compliance,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for healthcare worker (HCW) hand hygiene behavior are well established. Despite well-known dangers of healthcare-associated infection for healthcare workers and patients, hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates remain alarmingly low. To evaluate a potential solution to this ongoing challenge, we used a simulated patient encounter in a real hospital room to test the effectiveness of individual HH triggers. METHODS: One hundred and fifty HCW (75 physicians and 75 nurses) participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of five equal-sized groups. Each participant performed a focused physical exam on a standardized patient and was expected to maintain HH before and after the exam. Using two rooms in a medical-surgical department in a tertiary care teaching hospital, various cues were used and the effects on HHC before and after the examination were recorded. In the control group, the hand sanitizer dispenser was in its usual location (baseline). In one group, the donor was placed in line-of-sight upon entering the room; in another, flashing lights were attached to the dispenser (baseline & flicker) in its usual position (baseline & flicker); and in a third group, the dispenser was moved to line-of-sight and line-of-sight & flicker lights were installed. In the last group, a large warning sign was placed on the door informing the doctor that the room was under electronic control surveillance and failure to perform HHC would trigger an alarm. Data were analyzed using a generalized linear model to perform repeated measures logistic regression. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In the control group (baseline), the pre- and post-examination HHC rates were 36.7% and 33.3%, respectively. All interventions improved HHC preintervention compared to baseline (line of sight = 53.3%, baseline and flicker = 60%, line of sight and flicker = 66%, red flag = 93.3%), but only the sight & flicker and red flag led to a statistically significant increase in HHC before the examination (p = 0.022 and p < 0.001, respectively). Only the warning sign resulted in a statistically significant increase in HHC follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Visual cues can improve HHC, but their effectiveness varies. A warning sign indicating a monitoring system with subsequent reporting of non-compliance led to the most significant improvement in the HHC. Using a standardized patient in an actual hospital room was a useful tool to assess the impact of different interventions to improve HHC and patient safety.",1,1,
1786,The employment of opinion leaders on the ward for further training in the hospital.,"Opinion Leaders (OLs) are members of a social group with significant social influence over others. A guideline on urinary catheter care was established in three groups (A, B, and C) from two randomly assigned wards. Two OLs per ward were identified by the nurses in groups A and B using a sociological method. Training used in-service lectures for 30% of nurses and OLs tutorials for all nurses in group A; OLs tutorials in B, lectures in C and ward nurses were in turn responsible for the training of new entrants of nursing students. Before and after the training, the frequency of practice of the guideline was determined by interviewing 30% of the randomly selected nurses and by direct observation for incorrect practices. A student quiz on the guideline was also carried out. For all three measurement methods, the best results were in group A, followed by B and C;"" and the differences for the three groups were significant (p<0.05). This indicates that in-hospital training through hiring wards -OLs can be done effectively.",1,1,
1787,The escalating pandemics of obesity and physical inactivity. A call to action for clinicians,"Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are leading to an escalation of national and global epidemics that require increased attention from physicians and other health professionals. These intricately interconnected conditions are responsible for a tremendous burden of chronic disease, impairment of physical function and quality of life, at least 300,000 premature deaths, and at least $90 billion in direct health care costs each year in the United States alone. Clinicians are on the front lines of the fight, yet minimal attention is paid to these conditions during a typical office visit. Clinicians often feel overwhelmed by these challenges, citing a lack of clear guidelines and practice tools, minimal training in behavior change strategies, and lack of time as reasons for not addressing them. This report offers a ""call to action"" with step-by-step guidelines specifically designed to address the central role of physicians and other healthcare professionals in containing these dangerous epidemics. This action plan, which requires only minutes of a clinician's time to implement, will facilitate more effective intervention related to obesity and inactivity and should have beneficial public health implications.",0,0,
1788,The Esperance Primary Suicide Prevention Project,"BACKGROUND: Suicide has been a major community problem in Esperance, a geographically isolated port city on the south coast of Western Australia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of three evidence-based primary suicide prevention initiatives: (i) provide suicide education sessions for health, education and social care workers; (ii) limit the sale of over-the-counter analgesics (aspirin and paracetamol) to packets containing less than the minimum lethal dose;' and (iii) implement Commonwealth Media Guidelines on media coverage of suicides. METHODS: Changes in knowledge, awareness, attitudes, comfort, and use before and after each intervention were assessed using standardized instruments and pro forma devices derived from previous work such as the Youth Suicide Prevention Training Manual and the Suicide Intervention Beliefs Scale. Percentage changes in the number of retail outlets selling over-the-counter analgesics in less than potentially lethal amounts (less than 8g of acetaminophen or aspirin) were also measured. Media representatives were surveyed to get their perceptions of the Commonwealth guidelines for reporting suicide and encouraged to consult the project team before reporting problems with suicide. RESULTS: The baseline survey showed that mental health staff and general practitioners were more aware than staff of other services of the issue of suicide, risk factors for suicide, and awareness of professional and ethical responses, and were more willing to discuss the issue with a person at risk . Thirty-three subjects participated in suicide training, of which 21 (66%) returned questionnaires. There was a significant increase in awareness of suicide-related issues and risk factors, as well as a reported level of knowledge about professional and ethical responses, and comfort, competence, and confidence in supporting a person at risk. Only three media representatives were aware of the Commonwealth Department of Health's guidelines for reporting suicide, and only one believed the guidelines influenced their reporting. The local newspapers then contacted the researchers to verify that their reporting was within guidelines. Regarding access to analgesics, one in seven retailers said they would implement the strategy (subject to approval from other retailers), another claimed to have increased awareness of the danger of analgesics, and three said they would try monitor excessive quantities sold to an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Local initiatives can improve the awareness and knowledge of suicide risk assessment staff and local media. These need to be complemented by initiatives at the state or commonwealth level to bring about changes in national media or the sale of over-the-counter analgesics.",0,0,
1789,The ethical evaluation of innovative therapies: liver transplantation with living donors,"Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for many forms of liver disease. Unfortunately, the scarcity of donor cadaveric livers limits the availability of this technique. To improve the availability of liver transplants, surgeons have developed the ability to remove part of the liver from a living donor and transplant it into a recipient. A few liver transplants from living donors have been performed worldwide. Our aim was to analyze the ethics of living donor liver transplantation and to propose guidelines for the procedure before it was introduced in the United States. We used a “research ethics consultation” process that involves collaboration between clinical researchers and clinical ethicists. We concluded that it is ethically appropriate to perform living donor liver transplantation in a small patient series on an experimental basis and published our ethical guidelines in a medical journal before the procedure was introduced. We recommend this prospective, public approach for the introduction of further innovative therapies in medicine and surgery.",0,0,

1791,The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidelines on suicide treatment and prevention,"WITHOUT LABELING: Suicide is a major public health problem in the WHO European Region, causing over 150,000 deaths annually. Suicidal Crisis: Acute intervention should begin immediately to keep the patient alive. DIAGNOSIS: Up to 90% of people who have committed suicide have an underlying psychiatric disorder. Comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and personality disorders is high. In order to achieve successful suicidality prevention, adequate diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment of the underlying disease are essential. TREATMENT: Existing evidence supports the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in preventing suicidal behavior. Some other psychological treatments show promise, but supporting evidence is currently insufficient. Studies show that treatment with antidepressants reduces the risk of suicide in depressed patients. However, depressed patients treated with antidepressants are at risk of suicidal behavior during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Short-term concomitant medication with anxiolytics and hypnotics for anxiety and sleep disorders is recommended. TREATMENT with antidepressants in children and adolescents should only take place under the supervision of a specialist doctor. Long-term lithium treatment has been shown to be effective in preventing suicide and suicide attempts in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. TREATMENT with clozapine is effective in reducing suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics show promise, but more evidence is needed. TREATMENT TEAM: Multidisciplinary treatment teams made up of psychiatrists and other professionals such as psychologists, social workers and occupational therapists are always preferable, as the integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended, especially for patients with chronic suicidal tendencies. Family: Regardless of age, the suicidal person should always be motivated to involve the family in treatment. Social support: Psychosocial treatment and support is recommended as the majority of suicidal patients have problems with relationships, work, school and lack of functioning social networks. SAFETY: A safe home, public, and hospital environment without access to means of suicide is a necessary strategy in suicide prevention. Each treatment option, prescription of medication and discharge of the patient from the hospital should be carefully weighed against the risks involved. Training of staff: Training of general practitioners (GPs) is effective in suicide prevention. It improves treatment for depression and anxiety, the quality of care provided, and attitudes towards suicide. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals need continuous education, including discussions on ethical and legal issues.",0,0,
1792,The evaluation of a tailored intervention to improve the management of suspected viral encephalitis: protocol for a randomized controlled cluster study,"Background Viral encephalitis is a devastating disease in which delayed treatment is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical audits indicate significant scope for improved detection and treatment. Improvement strategies should ideally be tailored to identified needs and barriers to change. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a tailored intervention to improve secondary care for suspected encephalitis. Methods/Design The study is a two-armed, cluster-randomized, controlled study awarded by the Postgraduate Dean's Office. Participants were identified from 24 hospitals nested within 12 postgraduate deaneries in the United Kingdom (UK). We have developed a multi-faceted intervention package that includes core and flexible components with embedded behavior change techniques selected based on identified needs and barriers to change. The primary outcome will be composed of the proportion of patients with suspected encephalitis who receive a timely and appropriate diagnostic spinal tap within 12 hours of hospital admission and aciclovir treatment within 6 hours. We collect pre-procedure and up to 12 months post-procedure outcome data from patient records. Cluster-level statistical analysis is blind to attribution. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a health care perspective.",0,0,
1793,The Evolution of Current Medical and Popular Attitudes to Exposure to Ultraviolet Light: Part 3,"In the 1930's, attitudes toward ultraviolet (UV) light began to change significantly within the medical profession. UV radiation has been promoted as beneficial to health since the beginning of the century, particularly after the discovery of its role in vitamin D metabolism. However, increasing attention would be paid to the risks of UV light exposure from sunlamps and sunbathing. During this time, the American Medical Association established guidelines for the approval of UV lamps and the associated therapeutic uses of phototherapy. Findlay and other researchers' pioneering experiments inducing malignant skin tumors in rodents after exposure to UV lamps or sunlight would lead to widespread recognition of the carcinogenicity of UV radiation. The role of sunlight in the etiology of skin cancer was increasingly mentioned in articles in popular journals in the 1940s and 1950s. The sunscreen industry also experienced rapid growth, although product efficacy remained very variable. In the 1950s, interest developed in the use of 8-methoxypsoralen (""the suntan pill"") and dihydroxyacetone (""tan in a bottle""). Despite the well-known risks of UV exposure and attempts by doctors and other health professionals to educate the public and change behavior, tanning has remained stubbornly popular. Today, excessive exposure to UV light is recognized as the leading cause of the approximately 1.3 million cases of skin cancer in the United States each year.",0,0,

1795,"The set of expert consensus guidelines. Optimization of the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: Methods, Commentary and Summary","OBJECTIVES: A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available to clinicians of choice in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important issues related to drug selection, dosing and dose equivalents, and how to manage poor response, compliance issues, and relapse have not been adequately addressed in clinical trials. To support clinical decision making, a consensus survey of expert opinions on pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders was conducted to answer questions that have not been definitively answered in the research literature. METHOD: Based on a literature review, a written survey with 60 questions and 994 options was developed. Approximately half of the options were assessed using a modified version of the 9-point RAND scale for assessing the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to fill in answers (e.g. average doses) or tick a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders, of whom 47 (94%) completed it. In analyzing responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by the chi-square ""test of goodness"". We assigned each option a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternative choice, third line/usually inappropriate) based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Then, guideline tables were developed that indicate preferred treatment strategies for important clinical situations. RESULTS: The expert panel reached consensus on 88% of the options that were rated on the 9-point scale. The experts overwhelmingly endorsed the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychotic disorders. Risperidone was the first choice for patients with first and multiple episodes, with the other newer atypical drugs classified as first or high second line depending on the clinical situation. Clozapine and a long-acting injectable atypical drug (when available) were other highly effective second-line options for patients with multiple episodes. The expert's dosing recommendations closely matched the drug package inserts, and their estimates of dose equivalence among the antipsychotics followed a linear pattern. The experts considered 3-6 weeks an adequate antipsychotic study, but would wait slightly longer (4-10 weeks) before making a major change in treatment regimen if there is a partial response. The experts recommended trying to improve response by increasing the dose of atypical antipsychotics and depot antipsychotics before switching to another agent”; There was less consensus about increasing the dose of conventional antipsychotics before switching, likely due to concerns about side effects at higher doses. If a decision is made to switch to the drug due to an inadequate response, risperidone was the expert's first choice, regardless of which drug was initially tried. Although there were some differences in the expert's recommendations on how many drugs to try before switching to clozapine, the expert's responses suggest that a switch to clozapine should be done. Clozapine was also the antipsychotic of choice for patients with suicidal behavior. When switching from oral antipsychotics, experts considered cross-titration to be the preferred strategy. When switching to an injectable antipsychotic, the experts emphasized the importance of continuing the oral antipsychotic until therapeutic levels of the injectable are reached. The experts considered psychosocial interventions as the first-line strategy for patients with partial compliance, and pharmacological interventions as the first-line strategy for patients with clear evidence of non-compliance. However, because it can be difficult to distinguish partially compliant from noncompliant patients, the editors recommended combining psychosocial and pharmacological interventions whenever possible to improve compliance. If patients relapse due to compliance issues or there are doubts about compliance, the experts recommended using a long-acting injectable antipsychotic and would select an injectable atypical drug once that option becomes available. The experts would also consider the use of an injectable atypical antipsychotic (when available) in many clinical settings that do not involve compliance issues. The experts stressed the importance of monitoring patients being treated with antipsychotics for health problems - particularly obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, HIV risk behaviors, medical complications of substance abuse, heavy smoking and its effects, hypertension and amenorrhea. Although many patients are prescribed add-on treatments, multiple antipsychotics, and combinations of different classes of drugs (eg, antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers or antidepressants) to improve response, experts did not support any of these strategies except for antidepressants for patients with dysphoria/depression, antidepressants, or ECT for patients with suicidal behavior and mood stabilizers for patients with aggression/violence. When asked about indicators of remission and recovery, the experts considered acute improvement in psychotic symptoms as the most important indicator of remission, while assessing more sustained improvement in several outcome areas (e.g., recovery). CONCLUSIONS: The experts scored on many of the key treatment questions in high consensus from the survey.Within the limits of expert judgment, and with the expectation that future research data will prevail, these guidelines provide guidance for addressing common clinical dilemmas encountered in the pharmacological treatment of psychotic disorders.They can be used to To inform clinicians and educate patients about the relative merits of a variety of interventions Clinicians should remember that no guideline can address the complexity of each patient's care and that in applying these recommendations sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used.",0,0,
1796,The set of expert consensus guidelines. Treatment of behavioral emergencies 2005,"OBJECTIVES: Because of the inherent dangers and barriers to research in emergency settings, little data is available to guide clinicians on how best to manage behavioral emergencies. Key constructs such as agitation are poorly defined. This lack of empirical data prompted us to conduct an expert review, the results of which were published in the 2001 Expert Consensus Guidelines for the Treatment of Behavior Disorders. Several second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are now available in new formulations for the treatment of behavioral emergencies (e.g., intramuscular [IM] olanzapine and ziprasidone"";"" fast-dissolving tablets of olanzapine and risperidone). The field faces critical questions. The SGAs differ significantly from the FGAs and from each other and have not been studied like the FGAs in unselected patients. Can the SGAs be considered as a class, do all antipsychotics have similar antiagitation effects under different conditions, and what limitations might their safety profiles impose if they are equally effective? Should antipsychotics be used more specifically to treat psychotic disorders while benzodiazepines (BNZ) alone are used non-specifically? Few data are available on combinations of SGAs and BNZs, and evidence on the traditional combination of haloperidol plus a BNZ may not be relevant to combinations with SGAs. The culture is also evolving, placing more emphasis on patient involvement in treatment decisions. An international consensus has developed that reassurance rather than sedation is the appropriate endpoint of behavioral emergency interventions. We conducted a new expert survey to update the recommendations from the previous survey. METHOD: A written survey with 61 questions (1,020 options) was sent to 50 experts in the field, of whom 48 (96%) completed it. The survey aimed to determine the level of arousal at which emergency interventions are appropriate, the scope of the assessment depending on the urgency and the patients' ability to cooperate, guiding principles for the selection of the interventions, and appropriate physical and drug strategies at different levels of diagnostic reliability for a variety of preliminary diagnoses to be defined and aggravating conditions. A modified version of the RAND Corporation's 9-point Medical Decision Appropriateness Scale was used to rate most options. Consensus was defined as the non-random distribution of results by a chi-square ""fitness test"". We assigned each option a categorical rank (first line/preferred, second line/alternative, third line/usually inappropriate) based on the 95% confidence interval about the mean. Ratings were used to develop guidelines for preferred strategies in key clinical situations. This study received financial support from multiple sponsors, with the panel remaining blind to sponsors to reduce potential bias. Medication ratings were based only on responses from respondents with direct experience with each medication. When reporting on practice patterns, the panel was asked to respond based on actual data rather than estimates. RESULTS: The expert panel reached consensus on 78% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. The responses suggest that physicians can make preliminary diagnoses with some confidence and that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are selected differently based on the diagnosis and other salient demographic and medical characteristics. BNZs are recommended when data are unavailable, when there is no specific treatment (eg, personality disorder), or when they may have a specific benefit (eg, intoxication). No single SGA emerges as a non-specific replacement for haloperidol; instead, different SGAs are preferred in different circumstances, consistent with current evidence. To the extent that haloperidol is recommended, it is almost always in combination with a BNZ; Haloperidol alone is only preferred in those who are medically impaired. In contrast, the SGAs are more often recommended for use alone, and the Panel would avoid combining BNZs with some SGAs. Oral risperidone alone or in combination with a BNZ has strong support in a variety of settings. Oral olanzapine was rated very good, similar to risperidone, with slightly higher ratings than risperidone in settings where it has been studied (eg, schizophrenia, mania), and slightly lower ratings when it has not been studied or the security could be a concern; there was less support for combining oral olanzapine with a BNZ Olanzapine alone, risperidone alone or in combination with a BNZ, and halo peridol plus a BNZ are the first choices, with strong support as well, for the oral treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or mania for the combination of divalproex with the antipsychotic in suspected mania. Oral ziprasidone and quetiapine received generally similar second-line ratings in most settings. When a parenteral agent is needed, im-olanzapine alone received slightly more support than im-ziprasidone alone; however, there was more support for im-ziprasidone alone or in combination with a BNZ than for im-olanzapine plus BNZ, likely reflecting safety concerns. For example, for a tentative diagnosis of schizophrenia, first-line parenteral options are olanzapine or ziprasidone alone, or haloperidol or ziprasidone in combination with a BNZ no data are available or the diagnosis involves a medical comorbidity or intoxication. If the initial intervention with When risperidone, ziprasidone, or haloperidol was unsuccessful, the panel recommended adding a BZD to the antipsychotic Dose is recommended Perphenazine was consistently given second-line and droperidol and chlorpromazine received third-line ratings consistently. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of expert judgment and with the expectation that future research data will prevail, these guidelines suggest that SGAs are now preferred for agitation in primary psychiatric disorders, but that BNZs are preferred in other settings.",0,0,

The main objective of this pilot study was: 1) to refine the GDM Management System (GooDMomS), a web-based pregnancy and postpartum behavioral intervention, and 2) to assess the feasibility of the intervention. METHODS: In Phase 1, ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with women suffering from current or recent onset GDM mellitus GDM to collect pilot data on the web-based intervention interface and content, and to solicit recommendations from women on refinements to improve the GoodDMomS intervention site. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and independently reviewed to identify key themes using Atlas.ti v7.0. In Phase 2, a single-arm proof of concept study was conducted and 23 participants were enrolled in the GooDMomS program. Participants received web lessons, weight and glucose self-tracking, automated feedback, and access to a message board for peer support. The primary outcome was feasibility, including recruitment and retention, and acceptance. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of women whose weight gain during pregnancy (WLG) was within Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines and who were able to return to their pre-pregnancy weight after delivery. RESULTS: Comments from semi-structured interviews focused on: 1) usability of the online diary and tracking system for self-monitoring, 2) access to a safe, reliable social network for peer support, and 3) ability of prenatal clinicians to access the online Diary for clinical management. A total of 21 (91%) completed the pregnancy phase. 15/21 (71%) of the participants complied with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) GWG guidelines. Sixteen (70%) completed the postpartum period. 7/16 (43%) and 9/16 (56%) of the participants returned to their pre-pregnancy weight at 6 and 30 weeks postpartum, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents the feasibility of the GooDMomS program. Findings may have implications for weaving technology in perinatal care and inform the current care paradigm for women with GDM. The results support further research with recruiting a larger sample of participants and comparing the results with the intervention and standard of care.

DESIGN Multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group study. SETTING Four health boards of the Scottish National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who underwent colonoscopy after testing positive for fecal occult blood, as part of the national bowel screening program, and who had a histopathological diagnosis of adenoma has been confirmed. 163 were randomized to the intervention and 166 to the control. INTERVENTION Participants were randomized to a control group (weight-loss brochure only) or a 12-month intervention group (three in-person visits with a lifestyle consultant plus monthly 15-minute phone calls). The goal was a 7% reduction in body weight, and participants received a personalized energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) less than needed for weight maintenance) and a body weight scale. Motivational interviewing techniques examined self-assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values related to weight. Behavioral strategies included goal setting, identifying implementation intentions, self-monitoring of body weight, and providing counselor feedback on reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was weight change over 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and variables of glucose metabolism, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. RESULTS At 12 months, primary endpoint data were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. The mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared to 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38 ) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Between-group differences were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were assumed to be related to study participation. CONCLUSIONS Significant weight loss can be achieved through a diet and exercise intervention initiated as part of a national colorectal cancer screening program, which offers significant potential for reducing disease risk in older adults.

However, only a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of such programs for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of a structured, nurse-led patient education program and general practice care plan on outcome measures and events in patients with HFPEF. METHODS: Single-blind, randomized clinical trial with a six-month intervention and an additional 12-month follow-up. In the control group, patients (n = 41) were treated according to Russian national guidelines. Patients in the intervention group (n=44) received education on individual lifestyle modifications and changes in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), home exercise training, and weekly nurse consultations, in addition to usual care. RESULTS: Six months after enrollment, patients in the intervention group significantly improved body mass index, waist circumference, six-minute walk test distance, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, quality of life, and level of fear. At 18 months, there were 11 deaths (25%) or hospitalizations in the intervention group and 12 (29%) in the control group (p=0.134). Cardiovascular mortality and readmission rates were not significantly reduced at six months of follow-up: the hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.17-1.28""; P=0.197). At 18 months, this was 0.85 ( 0.42-1.73;"" P = 0.658). CONCLUSION: This primary care-based DMP for patients with HFPEF improved patients' emotional status and quality of life, positively influenced body weight, functional capacity, and lipid profile, and dampened cardiac remodeling.",0,0,

The setting was an alliance of five multidisciplinary group practices in Massachusetts. INTERVENTION The average Medicare reimbursement rate for 27 laboratory tests was displayed in an electronic health record at the time of ordering, including 21 less expensive tests (<$40.00) and six more expensive tests (>$40.00). MAIN INTERVENTIONS We compared the change in the slope of the monthly laboratory order rate between intervention and control physicians for 12 months before the intervention and 6 months after the intervention. We surveyed all intervention and control physicians 6 months after the intervention to capture attitudes towards costs and cost presentations. MAIN FINDINGS Among 27 laboratory tests, interventional physicians demonstrated a significant decrease in ordering rates compared to control physicians for five (19%) tests. These included a significant relative decrease in order rates for four out of 21 (19%) lower-cost lab tests and one out of six (17%) more expensive lab tests. A majority (81%) of physicians reported that the intervention improved their knowledge of the relative costs of laboratory testing. CONCLUSIONS The real-time display of cost information in an electronic medical record can result in a modest reduction in laboratory test orders and is well received. Our study shows that electronic health records can serve as a tool to promote cost transparency and reduce the use of laboratory tests.",1,1,
1803,The impact of evidence-based dissemination of guidelines for the assessment and treatment of major depression in a behavioral health care organization,"This study tests whether a managed behavioral therapy organization can influence adherence to practice guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in a randomized guideline dissemination trial. Guidelines were distributed to psychotherapists (N=443) under one of three conditions: (1) a general mailing of guidelines to clinicians, (2) a mailing in which guidelines were addressed to a patient beginning treatment with the clinician, and (3) no mailing of policies. Results showed no impact of guideline dissemination, despite sentinel effects, as measured by patient and physician self-reports and by episode characteristics derived from claims data. The results also revealed high rates of clinically reported compliance that were not detected in the harm data, indicating significant undertreatment of depression. Findings suggest that mental health systems need to look for other dissemination strategies to improve adherence to standards of care and increase the performance of independently practicing clinicians.",0,0,
1804,"The influence of guidelines, standards and economic restrictions on clinical decision-making processes","Guidelines aim to improve clinical decision-making. In contrast to textbooks and journals, which aim to improve medical knowledge, guidelines attempt to influence medical behavior. Scientific models of clinical decision-making such as action theory and empirical data on the effectiveness of guidelines suggest that guidelines do not always achieve their goals and can even lead to a deterioration in the quality of medical care. Therefore, there is a need for controlled clinical trials to investigate whether guideline-exposed physicians achieve better patient outcomes than guideline-naïve physicians. Guidelines can only be regarded as evidence-based if their positive effect is empirically proven.",0,0,

1806,The impact of medication adherence on lung health outcomes in cystic fibrosis,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As new drugs continue to be introduced to improve the health of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), addressing patient adherence becomes increasingly important. Currently, adherence to pulmonary medications in people with CF is about 50%. Recent research has shown that poor adherence to therapy is associated with poorer health outcomes. This review summarizes recent research on the impact of adherence on lung health and highlights future areas of research and clinical practice to address this growing need. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent research has shown that nonadherence is associated with more hospital admissions and pulmonary exacerbations, lower lung function, and longer length of stay. However, most research has been conducted using pharmacy refill records as an objective measure of compliance. Electronic drug monitoring provides more detailed information about usage patterns that can feed directly into clinical care. In addition, few clinical studies have been published examining behavioral interventions to promote adherence. SUMMARY: Given recent research linking adherence to lung health outcomes, there is a growing need to measure and assess adherence in clinical care. As new drugs are approved for CF, methods for monitoring adherence to therapy must also be developed and approved. Clinicians must continue to assess barriers to adherence in order to tailor interventions to a patient's needs.",0,0,
1807,The effects of assisted telemetry monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diabetes is increasing and current treatments are unsustainable. Effective approaches to support self-management are needed. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether assisted telemetric monitoring of glycemic control and blood pressure leads to a reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; the primary outcome of a measurement of long-term glycemic control) and secondary outcomes of blood pressure and weight in humans with poorly controlled diabetes compared to a control group receiving usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: Design: Multicenter, randomized controlled study with embedded qualitative study. Setting: Primary care in the Lothian, Kent, Glasgow and Borders regions of the UK. Participants: People with type 2 diabetes and confirmed HbA1c>7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Intervention/Comparison: Randomization into intervention or control groups will be performed by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit. Intervention group participants are shown how to use blood glucose and blood pressure monitors and scales that use Bluetooth wireless technology to modem readings to a remote server. These participants will be asked to measure morning and evening blood sugar at least twice a week, and weight and blood pressure weekly. Measurements are reviewed at least weekly by in-office nurses who liaise with patients to adjust therapy according to guidelines and reinforce lifestyle advice. The participants in the control group receive the usual care. All participants receive individual training. Follow-up: Measurements will be taken at practices 9 months after randomization by research nurses blinded to assignment. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c and the secondary outcome measure is daily systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and cost per quality-adjusted life year. Analysis: Intention-to-treat analyzes are carried out. The sample size of 320 participants allows for a 20% drop-out and has a power of 80% at 5% significance to detect an absolute drop in HbA1c of 0.5% (6 mmol/mol) in the intervention group. The qualitative study will examine the experiences of patients and professionals using the intervention. STUDY REGISTRATION: Study Registration Number ISRCTN71674628.",0,0,

1809,The importance of doctor-patient communication in the care of somatizing patients,"The term ""somatization"" refers to the manifestation of multiple somatic ailments that are not explained by organic changes. According to the literature, 15-25 percent of all doctor visits are related to somatization. Because medical education places too little emphasis on evaluating the possible psychological background of certain somatic symptoms, physicians can feel powerless and make unwarranted diagnostic and therapeutic efforts. Patients may also feel helpless and frustrated, and their anxiety and distress may increase. Because stress is an important factor in the somatization process, reducing stress and improving coping are key elements of chronic disease treatment guidelines. Evidence-based interventions range from brief counseling and medication to cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy. Reattribution, a short (10-30 minutes) structured intervention that can be delivered in primary or secondary care, can result in significant reductions in somatic symptoms and anxiety in certain cases.",0,0,
1810,The Study to Improve Care in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: CAROL-Improvement of Care Processes and Quality of Life of COPD Patients in Primary Care: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: The Swiss Ministry of Health launched a national quality program ""QualiCCare"" in 2011 to improve healthcare for patients with COPD. The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in the COPD Quality Initiative (“QualiCCare”) improves adherence to recommended clinical trials processes and shows the impact on COPD care for patients and on the impact of COPD on an individual's life . METHODS: CAROL is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with randomization at the general practitioner level. Thirty primary care physicians are randomly assigned to an intervention or control group of equal size. Each general practitioner consults patients aged 45 years or older with a smoking history of >/= ten pack years (PY) sequentially and regardless of the reason for the current consultation. Patients with confirmed (by spirometric evaluation) COPD will be included in the study. General practitioners in the intervention group receive “QualiCCare” training, which addresses knowledge, decision-making and behavioral aspects and the delivery of care according to COPD quality indicators and evidence-based key elements. In the control group, no educational intervention is used and COPD patients are treated as usual. The duration of study is one year. The primary outcome measure is an aggregate score of relevant clinical processes that define elements in the care of patients with COPD: smoking cessation counseling, influenza vaccination, motivation for physical activity, appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient education, and collaborative care. With a power of 90% and an alpha significance level of 5%, 15 general practitioners with eight patients each are required in both study arms. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, 288 patients must be included. DISCUSSION: It is important to design and implement interventions that add value to COPD care while considering quality and efficiency. Care pathways that transform physician knowledge and behavior have the potential to improve care by transferring knowledge into clinical practice.

1811,The impact of a physician and patient intervention program on food intake,"BACKGROUND: Efficient dietary interventions for hypertensive patients in clinical settings are required. AIM: To evaluate the separate and combined impact of a physician intervention (MD-I) and a patient intervention (PT-I) on food intake in hypertensive patients. DESIGN: A nested 2x2 design, randomized controlled trial conducted over 18 months. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 physicians and 574 outpatients with hypertension. INTERVENTION: MD-I included training modules addressing the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension, Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension and Lifestyle Modifications. PT-I included lifestyle coaching on adopting the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern, reducing sodium intake, weight management, increasing physical activity, and moderate alcohol consumption. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Food intake was measured using the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire. Conformity with the DASH dietary pattern was estimated by a DASH score. STATISTICAL ANALYZES: The main effects of MD-I and PT-I and their interaction were assessed using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: After 6 months of intervention, MD-I participants significantly increased intakes of potassium, fruits, juices, and carbohydrates; decreased fat intake; and improved overall diet quality as measured by the Healthy Eating Index. The PT-I intervention resulted in increased intakes of carbohydrate, protein, fiber, calcium, potassium, fruit and fruit juices, vegetables, dairy, and the Healthy Eating Index, and decreased intakes of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, Sweets and additives fats/oils/sweets. In addition, PT-I improved the overall DASH concordance score. The change in DASH score was significantly associated with changes in blood pressure and weight at 6 months. After 18 months, most changes returned to baseline, including the DASH score. CONCLUSIONS: Both MD-I and PT-I improved eating behavior at 6 months with some lasting effects at 18 months. Although all observed dietary changes were consistent with DASH nutrient goals or food group guidelines, only the PT-I intervention was effective in improving overall DASH concordance score. This finding confirms the role of medical nutritional therapy in intensive long-term interventions for hypertensive risk reduction and weight control, and underscores the need to develop maintenance strategies. Additionally, this study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between physicians, licensed dietitians and other nutritionists, and lay health professionals while supporting patients to make healthy behavior changes.",0,0,
1812,The influence of patient characteristics on the adequacy of surgical treatment in breast cancer patients. Progetto Oncologia Femminile,"BACKGROUND: As part of a multi-year educational effort sponsored by the Ministry of Health and regional health authorities, patterns of care for breast cancer patients in Italian general hospitals were monitored to identify areas of practice whose quality needed improvement. DESIGN: Information on the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed on 1724 consecutive breast cancer patients in 63 general hospitals in eight Italian regions was collected retrospectively from medical records. The quality of care was assessed by a diagnostic and therapeutic score based on the observed level of adherence to pre-established procedures. RESULTS: The median of the total diagnostic score and the staging score was 60%. About a third of surgical procedures (38%) were inappropriate: a quarter (24%) of stage I-II patients had unnecessarily radical surgery (i.e., Halsted mastectomy) and limited surgery in patients with small tumors (i.e., , < or = 2 cm) was underused. Chronological age influenced physician behavior: older patients were more likely to have less intensive diagnostic work-up and less appropriate surgical treatment (with more frequent use of unnecessary radical surgery and less frequent resort to limited surgery), regardless of their overall health status. The presence of one or more concomitant diseases was associated with a lack of axillary clearance and a lower use of conservative surgery regardless of age. CONCLUSION: In agreement with others, this study confirms the existence of a clinically meaningful influence of patient age on diagnostic and therapeutic behavior and the use of unnecessarily radical surgical procedures. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the next phase of the educational project, in which practice guidelines will be developed and implemented to improve the quality of care for breast cancer patients.",0,0,
1813,"The Intellectual Structure and Substance of the Knowledge Use Field: A Longitudinal Cocitation Analysis by Authors, 1945 to 2004","Background It has been argued that science and society are in the midst of a far-reaching renegotiation of the social contract between science and society, with society becoming a far more active partner in the creation of knowledge. On the one hand, new forms of knowledge production are emerging, on the other hand, science and society are experiencing a rapid acceleration of new forms of knowledge use. At the same time, since World War II, the science underpinning the field of knowledge exploitation has experienced exponential growth. There is little in-depth research in this area and no comprehensive analyzes using bibliometric methods have been carried out. Methods Using bibliometric analyses, particularly first-author co-citation analyses, our group performed a domain analysis of the knowledge use field and traced its historical development between 1945 and 2004. Our aim was to map the historical development of knowledge use as a field and to identify the changing intellectual structure of its scientific domains. We have more than 5,000 articles based on citation data from the Web of Science? analyzed. Search terms were combinations of knowledge, research, evidence, policy, ideas, science, innovation, technology, information theory and use, utilization and uptake. Findings We provide an overview of the intellectual structure and how it has changed over six decades. The field does not become large enough to represent with a cocitation map until the mid-1960s. Our results show strong growth from the mid-1960s to 2004, as well as the emergence of specialized domains that reflect distinct collectives of intellectual activity and thought. By the mid-1980s, the main domains were focused on innovation diffusion, technology transfer, and knowledge exploitation. Beginning slowly in the mid-1980s and then growing rapidly, a fourth scientific field emerged, evidence-based medicine. The field is dominated every decade by one individual, Everett Rogers, and by one paradigm, diffusion of innovation. Conclusion We conclude that the common view that social science disciplines are in a state where no accepted principles or theories guide research (that is, that they are preparadigmatic) cannot be supported for this area. Second, we document the emergence of a new domain in the field of knowledge use, evidence-based medicine. Third, we conclude that Everett Rogers was the dominant figure in this field and that his presentation of the general model of diffusion was the dominant paradigm in this field until the advent of evidence-based medicine.",0,0,
1814,"The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS): rationale and design of a randomized, placebo-controlled study with 12-month follow-up of self-administered versus clinically administered CBT in moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome","Irritable bowel syndrome is a common, often disabling, gastrointestinal disorder whose full spectrum of symptoms lacks satisfactory medical or dietary management. One of the few empirically validated treatments involves a specific psychological therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy, which, when available, is typically administered over several months by trained physicians in tertiary care settings. There is an urgent need to develop more effective versions of CBT that require minimal professional assistance but retain the efficacy profile of clinically based CBT. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Outcome Study (IBSOS) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate whether a self-administered version of CBT is at least as effective as standard CBT and more effective than an attentional control in reducing core GI symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and its burden (e.g. psychological strain, impairment of quality of life, etc.) in moderately to severely affected irritable bowel patients. Additional objectives are to assess the durability of the response to treatment over a 12-month period at quarterly intervals; identifying clinically useful patient characteristics associated with the outcome to gain an understanding of subgroups of participants for whom CBT is most beneficial; identify theory-based mechanisms of change (agents) that explain how and why CBT works;"" and assess the economic costs and benefits of CBT. Between August 2010, when IBSOS began recruiting subjects, and February 2012, the IBSOS randomized 171 of 480 patients The results have the potential to improve the health of IBS patients, reduce their social and economic costs, conserve scarce health care resources and inform evidence-based practice guidelines.",0,0,
1815,The Italian Diabetes and Physical Activity Study 2 (IDES-2): a long-term behavioral intervention for adopting and maintaining a physically active lifestyle,"BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA)/exercise has become an integral part of the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, due to a number of obstacles, most notably the lack of acceptable, feasible, and validated behavioral intervention strategies, current guidelines are difficult to implement in this population. The present manuscript reports the rationale, study design, and methods, and design considerations of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)-2, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a behavior modification strategy in increasing total daily PA and reducing sedentary time tests (SED time) in patients with T2DM. METHODS/DESIGN: On January 7, 2014, IDES_2 began enrolling 300 patients with known T2DM of at least 1 year's duration in three tertiary-referral diabetes outpatient clinics in Rome. Additional requirements are age 40 to 80 years, body mass index 27 to 40 kg/m(2), sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity for at least 6 months, ability to walk 1 mile unaided, and fitness based on cardiovascular assessment . Patients will be randomized by center and within each center, by age, and type of diabetes treatment to either the intervention or control groups. Patients in the intervention group (INT) (n = 150) receive theoretical and practical training counseling consisting of aggregated behavior modification techniques once a year (one individual theoretical counseling session plus eight twice-weekly individual theoretical and practical training counseling sessions). 3 years. Patients in the control group (CON) (n = 150) receive standard care, including general practitioner recommendations for daily PA. The primary outcomes are total daily PA and SED time, measured objectively through the use of an accelerometer. Secondary outcomes are physical fitness, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, musculoskeletal disorders, well-being/depression and health-related quality of life. DISCUSSION: The behavioral intervention strategy tested in IDES_2 is based on solid theoretical foundations and uses multiple behavior change techniques, two factors that have been shown to improve the effectiveness of behavioral interventions. In addition, physicians and exercise specialists have been specifically trained to advise/prescribe and/or monitor PA/exercise in patients with metabolic disorders. Finally, the large sample size, the long study duration, and the objective measurement of PA allow statistically significant and scientifically robust conclusions on the feasibility and effectiveness of this intervention in T2DM patients.

1819,The LIFESTYLE Study: Costs and Effects of a Structured Lifestyle Program in Overweight and Obese Subfertile Women to Reduce the Need for Fertility Treatment and Improve Reproductive Outcome. A randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, 30% of subfertile women are overweight or obese and there is currently no agreement on fertility treatment for them. Data from observational and small intervention studies suggest that weight reduction increases the likelihood of conception, reduces pregnancy complications, and improves perinatal outcome, but this has not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials. This study will evaluate the costs and effects of a six-month structured lifestyle program aimed at weight loss followed by conventional fertility treatment (intervention group) versus conventional fertility treatment (control group) in overweight and obese subfertile women. We hypothesize that the intervention will reduce the need for fertility treatment, reduce obesity-related pregnancy complications, and improve perinatal outcome. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, controlled study in subfertile women (age 18-39 years) with a body mass index between 29 and 40 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria are azoospermia, use of donor sperm, severe endometriosis, premature ovarian failure, endocrinopathies, or pre-existing hypertensive disorders. In the intervention group, a weight loss of at least 5% to 10% over a period of six months is aimed for through a combination of diet, increased physical activity and behavior change. If conception has not been achieved after six months, these patients start fertility treatment according to the Dutch fertility guidelines. In the control group, treatment is started according to the Dutch fertility guidelines, regardless of the patient's weight. OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome measure is a healthy singleton born at least 37 weeks gestation after vaginal delivery. Secondary outcome measures including pregnancy outcome and complications, percentage of women requiring fertility treatment, clinical and sustained pregnancy rates, body weight, quality of life, and cost were performed to compare costs and health effects in the intervention and control groups. DISCUSSION: The study will provide evidence of the costs and effects of a lifestyle intervention aimed at weight reduction in overweight and obese subfertile women and will provide clinician guidance for the management of these patients.

Questionnaires help define the patient's diagnosis and degree of nicotine addiction, as well as the fingerprint of their smoking history. The ICD-10 code and the Fagerstrom nicotine addiction test are used. Without optimal patient motivation, no therapy is indicated. Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model of dividing the motivational stage into anticipation, contemplation, preparation and action is widespread. Many other factors such as previous experiences, disaster scenarios, self-efficacy, and choice of therapeutic modality are important for the best outcome. 90% of a gatekeeper's job is minimal intervention. This means individually tailored reasoning to guide the patient's motivation to quit smoking. The concept is defined in the rules of the five R's with Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Obstacles and Repetition. According to these criteria, the gatekeeper achieves up to a 60% positive motivational shift with only minimal intervention. Smoking cessation guidelines around the world are very similar, showing a Level A synergy of behavioral therapy and medication with either nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline. Choosing a different regimen is either less efficient or, anecdotally, results in a further loss in the smoker's life expectancy. The gatekeeper has the infrastructure, know-how and trust of his patients to act as disease manager.

The aim of the study was to test whether this multimodal intervention improves adherence to recommended targets for a number of surrogate indicators relevant to blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium phosphate changes. The study also tested whether the same procedure slowed the progression of CKD and prevented cardiovascular complications in CKD patients. METHOD: Twenty-two renal clinics were randomized into 2 arms: an intervention arm applying a multi-method quality improvement intervention and a control arm providing standard of care. Surrogate indicators were measured to assess blood pressure (BP) control, sodium intake, proteinuria, dyslipidemia, anemia, and calcium phosphate changes. RESULTS: Despite the fact that the vast majority of patients enrolled in this study (95%) were treated with antihypertensive drugs, baseline blood pressure goals (specific for proteinuria and diabetes) were met in only 45% of non-proteinuric patients, and only just 45% reaches 14% and 18% of proteinuria and diabetics, respectively. Use of diuretics in hypertensive patients was less than required, and approximately 80% of patients had salt excretion > 100 mmol/24 hours. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were outside the target range in over 40% of patients, but only about 60% of them were on statins. A large majority of CKD patients were obese or overweight. The proportion of smokers was relatively low (13%) and 37% of patients had quit smoking, indicating patient awareness of the health risks of smoking.

1824,The 21st Century Medical Practice (MOXXI): Effectiveness of computer-assisted decision support in reducing inappropriate prescriptions in primary care.,"Background: Adverse drug-related events are common in the elderly, and inappropriate prescribing is a preventable risk factor. Our aim was to determine whether inappropriate prescriptions could be reduced if GPs had computerized access to information on all prescriptions issued and automatic alerts to potential prescription problems. METHODS: We randomly assigned 107 general practitioners with at least 100 patients aged 66 years and older (total 12,560) to receive computerized decision making support (CDS) or a control group. Physicians in the CDS group had access to current and past prescription information through a special computer link to the province's senior drug insurance program. When any of the 159 clinically relevant prescribing issues were identified by the CDS software, the physician received a notification detailing the nature of the issue, potential consequences, and alternative therapies. The rate of initiation and discontinuation of potentially inappropriate prescriptions was assessed over a 13-month period. Results: In the 2 months prior to the study, 31.8% of patients in the CDS group and 33.3% of patients in the control group had at least 1 potentially inappropriate prescription. During the study, the number of new potentially inappropriate prescriptions per 1000 visits was significantly lower (18%) in the CDS group than in the control group (relative rate [RR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0, 98) , but between-group differences in the discontinuation rate of potentially inappropriate prescriptions were only for therapeutic duplication by study physician and another physician (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.99-2.79) and drug-drug interactions induced by Investigator-issued prescriptions were significantly investigator (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.98-4.70). Interpretation: Computerized access to full drug profiles and alerts to potential prescribing problems reduces the rate of initiation of potentially inappropriate prescriptions, but has a more selective impact on the discontinuation of such prescriptions.",0,1,
1825,The moderating effect of client adherence-promoting interventions on evidence-based practices for children and adolescents with mental health problems,"The lack of adherence of children and adolescents to evidence-based psychosocial interventions remains a fundamental barrier to treatment effectiveness. To maintain patient adherence, researchers and clinicians have employed a range of strategies to promote adherence, from phone calls and letters to the provision of transportation and childcare to motivation-enhancing therapies. However, the impact of adherence promoters on intervention outcomes has not been reported. This study examined the moderating effect of adherence-promoting strategies in a survey and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and psychoeducation for children and adolescents with mental health problems (k = 33). The results showed the nature and intensity of the moderated study effect sizes of the adherence promoters according to the patient characteristics (age, gender, diagnosis). Preliminary results suggest that men had higher effect sizes when more intensive efforts were made to promote adherence. Efforts to promote adherence were associated with smaller effect sizes in adolescents diagnosed with externalizing disorders. The results of this study suggest directions for future research to clarify clinical guidelines to maximize retention in evidence-based psychotherapy.",0,0,

New strategies are needed to improve the quality of care for children with ADHD and improve pediatrician application of the AAP consensus guidelines. An evidence-based quality improvement intervention was developed that effectively improves the quality of ADHD care provided by outpatient pediatricians. To enable this intervention model to be widely disseminated, the entire intervention was modified for online delivery. The intervention is called the myADHDportal.com Improvement Program. The full functionality of this online intervention is described, including the collection of online ADHD rating scales from parents and teachers, and online communication between parents, teachers, and physicians. In addition, the web portal integrates several innovative quality improvement features, including an online wizard to map ADHD patient flow, an online report card to monitor quality of care, and an online wizard to guide practices through the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle process. The combination of clinical utility and quality improvement tools facilitates the delivery of quality ADHD care and reduces several of the barriers to implementing AAP-recommended behaviors.

1836,The problem of survey research.,"The problem with survey research argues against survey research as the primary source of reliable information. George Beam argues that all survey research tools, all types of questions - including surveys, face-to-face interviews and focus groups - produce unreliable and potentially inaccurate results. Because those who rely on survey research only see answers to questions, they and others cannot evaluate the results. They have no way of knowing whether the responses reflect respondents' actual behavior (objective phenomena) or their true beliefs and opinions (subjective phenomena). Reliable information can only be obtained through observation, experimentation, multiple data sources, formal model building and testing, document analysis and comparison. In fifteen chapters divided into six parts – Ubiquity of Survey Research, The Problem, Questioning Tools, Question Settings, Questioners and Appropriate Methods and Research Designs – The Problem with Survey Research shows how questioning tools, settings in which questions and answers take place, and survey researchers themselves falsify the results and thereby make the answers unreliable. The final two chapters and appendices examine observation, other methods of data collection, and research designs that can provide accurate or correct information, and show how reliance on survey research can and must be overcome.

1838,The QICKD study protocol: a cluster-randomized study comparing quality improvement interventions with lower systolic blood pressure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in primary care,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a relatively newly recognized but common long-term disease affecting 5 to 10% of the population. Effective CKD management, with an emphasis on strict blood pressure control, reduces cardiovascular risk and slows CKD progression. Currently, there is an unprecedented increase in referrals to specialized kidney services, which are often based in tertiary centers, are inconvenient for patients and waste resources. National and international CKD guidelines contain quality goals for primary care. However, no rigorous evaluations of strategies implementing these guidelines have been conducted. The purpose of this study is to test whether quality improvement interventions improve primary care for elevated blood pressure in chronic kidney disease, reduce cardiovascular risk, and slow kidney disease progression with usual exercise. The two interventions include: providing clinical practice guidelines with prompts and audit-based education. The study population will be all people with CKD from general practices in eight locations across England. Randomization takes place at the level of general practitioners. The intended sample (three arms from 25 practices) allows the study to detect a difference of 3 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between the different quality improvement interventions. An additional 10 practices per arm will receive a questionnaire to measure changes in confidence in managing CKD. Follow-up is over two years. Outcomes are measured using anonymized, routinely collected data extracted from office computer systems. Our primary outcome measure will be the reduction in systolic blood pressure in people with chronic kidney disease and hypertension at two years. Secondary outcomes include biomedical outcomes and quality markers, including physician confidence in managing CKD. A small group of practices (n = 4) participate in an in-depth process evaluation. We will use time series data to examine the natural history of CKD in the community. Finally, we carry out an economic assessment based on a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of each intervention.",0,0,
1839,The Quality of Diabetes Care for Gullah Families in South Carolina,"Empirical evidence from the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) suggests that maintaining normal glycemic control can prevent both microvascular and macrovascular disease in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (DCCT, 1993 ). Adults with T2DM are also more likely to have hypertension (73% [HTN]) and patients with both are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop diabetic complications compared to the general population (CDC, 2005). The purpose of this descriptive study was to 1) describe the quality of diabetes care received by Gullah families who participated in the Project SuGar research study"";"" and 2) compare Gullah's quality of care to the national sample in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Diabetes Reporting Card using two indicators of blood pressure and HbA1c. This was a secondary analysis from an overarching study that compared selected data to the CDC Diabetes Report Card, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from 1,057 research participants (N=1,057). Overall, compared to the national sample in the CDC reporting map, HbA1c was greater than 9.5% mg/dL in the gullahs (30.2% vs. 18%) and blood pressure was greater than 140/90 mmHg lower (29% vs. 34%) among participants. Almost half of the gullahs (45.9%) self-reported neurovascular complications such as foot pain, claudication, and kidney complications from kidney infection and dialysis (7.3%). The Gullah study participants are at risk for diabetes-related complications. The results suggest a quality gap in diabetes care and also suggest health differences in outcome measures. Optimal care that conforms to clinical guidelines could have a significant impact in reducing complications and health inequalities.",0,0,
1840,The rational patient and beyond: implications for treatment adherence in people with psychiatric disabilities.,"Aim: Many people with mental disabilities do not benefit from evidence-based practices because they often do not seek or fully adhere to them. One way psychologists have made sense of this rehabilitation and health decision-making process, and subsequent behaviors (of which adherence might be considered one) is by proposing a “rational patient”; that is, decisions are made consciously by weighing perceived costs and benefits Intervention options However, social psychological research suggests limitations of a rational patient theory that affect models of health decision design: the research literature has been based on studies of rational patient models and alternative theories with empirical Support reviewed, with a particular focus on models related to decisions about rehabilitation strategies for psychiatric disabilities. Results: Notions of the rational patient evolved from several psychological models, including the health belief model, protective motivation theory, and planned behavior theory. A variety of practice strategies have evolved to encourage rational decision-making. However, research also suggests limitations to rational considerations of health. (1) Rather than being carefully and consciously considered, many health decisions are implicit and may be made outside of awareness. (2) decisions are not always planned; often it is the immediate needs of a context, rather than prior trade-offs, that have the greatest impact. (3) cool cognitions often do not dictate the process; emotional factors play an important role in health decisions. Each of these limitations suggest additional exercise strategies that will ease a person's health decisions. Conclusion: Old models of rational decision making need to be replaced by multiprocess models that explain supradeliberative factors in health decisions and behaviors (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)",0,0,

1842,"The results of large clinical trials: critical appraisal, dissemination of information and media coverage","The roundtable chose to focus its discussion on studies that, in terms of their importance, are likely to transform medical practices and behaviors. Such studies can be pre- or post-marketing studies. For the results of a study to change practice, they must be credible and meet basic methodological criteria. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to complete this binary assessment through the use of an assessment checklist appropriate for each category of user, ie the regulator, prescribing physicians and patients, sometimes informed directly by the media. The Round Table members proposed the ""Giens 2003 Checklist"". It consists of an interpretive semi-quantitative assessment checklist based on simple, actionable messages. A critical evaluation is a necessary prelude to the dissemination of the results to the different parties involved (healthcare professionals, patients, patient associations, the media and the general public) and the process of informing these parties in easy to understand but precise terms. The practical implementation of the results with a change in behavior and/or the issuing of guidelines are follow-up steps for which a certain delay time is unavoidable. The evaluation of implementation programs, together with a detailed analysis of the obstacles to changing medical practice in the future, is intended to improve and accelerate the implementation of important results in order to optimize patient management.",0,0,

The study setting was conducted in a primary care facility in northern Jordan. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two dyslipidemic patients were randomized into intervention and control groups and followed up for a period of 6 months. Patients in the intervention group were closely monitored by a clinical pharmacist who worked closely with physicians to monitor lipid profiles according to the third edition of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel recommendations. The patients in the control group received standard medical care. The main outcome measures the percentage of patients in the intervention group who met their low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goal compared to the percentage of patients in the control group who met their low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goal at the end of the study achieved. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients completed the study period. At 6 months, 94.5% of patients in the intervention group and 71.2% of patients in the control group achieved their target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels (P value < 0.001, Pearson's chi-square test), compared to 24.7 and 28.8% at baseline. The majority of pharmacist recommendations (90.4%) were followed by physicians, and overall lipid-lowering drug use increased to 91.8% in intervention-group patients and 86.5% in control-group patients, compared with 69.9 and 78.8% at baseline.

Analysis of the GP characteristics associated with high compliance among its beneficiaries. Methods A questionnaire on screening behavior was sent to 1192 general practitioners from 13 districts of the Lazio region. We asked GPs to participate in a randomized study, we drew samples from 130 GPs, and approximately 1/10 of GP beneficiaries aged 50-75 (n = 3657) were invited for a screening in the GP office, and 1 /10 (3675) at the nearest gastroenterology center. Results 58.5% of the general practitioners completed the questionnaire and 22.7% agreed to take part in the study. Compliance in the general practitioner arm was 50%, in the hospital arm 16% (RR 3.4”; 95% CI: 3.13–3.70). There was great variability in the compliance achieved by primary care physicians. GPs with more than 25 patients visited/day and those wrongly recommended for early detection of colorectal cancer achieved lower compliance (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57-0.95 and OR 0.76, respectively, 95% CI: 0.59-0.97). . Conclusions Involving primary care physicians in colorectal cancer screening can be very effective in improving compliance, but effectiveness depends on their willingness to participate.",0,1,
1847,The role of nurses/social workers in using a multidimensional guideline to diagnose anxiety and challenging behavior in people with intellectual disabilities,"OBJECTIVES AND OBJECTIVES: This study attempts to (1) examine the impact of implementing the ""Diagnostic Guideline for Anxiety and Challenging Behavior in Clients with Intellectual Disability"" on the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers""; and (2) assess the role of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process when using the guideline. BACKGROUND: Nurses/social workers have extensive contact with clients with intellectual disabilities. Despite this key position, the contribution of nurses/social workers to diagnosing mental health problems and challenging behaviors is rather limited. The authors developed the multidimensional ""Diagnostic Guide for Anxiety and Challenging Behavior"". This article evaluates the implementation of this guideline with regard to the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers and the role of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process. DESIGN: This study used a comparative design with multiple case studies. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative research methods. RESULTS: Working with the Diagnostic Guide to Anxiety and Challenging Behavior resulted in a statistically significant increase in knowledge and self-efficacy among the nurses/social workers in the experimental condition compared to the nurses/social workers in the control condition. Nurses/social workers and psychologists appreciated the nurses/social workers' more active contribution to the diagnostic process. CONCLUSIONS: Working with the guideline increased the knowledge and self-efficacy of nurses/social workers and led to more active involvement of nurses/social workers in the diagnostic process. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: After completing a training program, nurses/social workers can effectively contribute to the process of diagnosing clients with anxiety and associated challenging behaviors.",0,0,
1848,"The role of relational, developmental, neonatal critical care in strengthening preterm infant outcomes","This article describes the conceptual framework, clinical application, and efficacy of a relationship-based, developmental supportive approach to neonatal critical care called NIDCAP (Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program). The results of the approach are reported in terms of infant health and development, reduction in hospital costs, and family adaptation. The approach is guided by a neurodevelopmental framework for understanding preterm infants and depends on the ability of professionals to work with each other and families to support the medical, developmental and emotional well-being of infants. The primary vehicle for clinical implementation is a detailed behavioral observation, followed by recommendations for individualized care based on the infant's current functioning and apparent developmental goals. A number of key components of developmental care are described, including strategies for coordinated discharge planning and linkage with community services. The voices of individual clinicians underscore the process of shifting from protocol-based to relationship-based care.",0,0,
1849,The role of stimulants in the management of preschool children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms can start early, beginning before age 6. Despite the significant number of preschool children who can be diagnosed with ADHD, there is limited controlled data on the pharmacologic interventions that are increasingly being used in this population. A 1990 review showed that 34% of pediatricians and 15% of general practitioners had prescribed psychostimulants for preschool children with ADHD, and pharmacoepidemiological studies indicate an increase in stimulant use among preschool children in the 1990s. Unfortunately, only six controlled trials totaling fewer than 200 children have been conducted with these drugs in preschool children. Although these small studies provide some evidence of the benefit of using methylphenidate in preschoolers with ADHD, more data is urgently needed. Practice parameters developed by the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics provide some guidance for diagnosing and treating young children with ADHD, but are based primarily on research in elementary-school children. The ongoing Preschool ADHD Treatment Study (PATS), funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, will provide important clinical guidance for diagnostic considerations and intervention strategies for children with ADHD ages 3 to 5 years. Until data from the PATS study is published, clinicians must rely on developmental assessment skills, available standardized assessment tools, reports of the child from multiple informants, and knowledge of the risks and benefits of available pharmacological and behavioral treatments to treat preschool children effective with ADHD.",0,0,
1850,The role of surveillance in the management of small renal tumors,"Incidentally, the detected small renal tumors (SRMs) have increased significantly in recent years due to the widespread use of enhanced cross-sectional imaging. A significant number of incidental SRMs are diagnosed in elderly patients who are more likely to undergo imaging for other medical problems. The natural history of SRM is historically not well understood, as most masses are surgically removed shortly after diagnosis. Several reports on the surveillance of SRM have been published in recent years. When followed conservatively with serial imaging, SRMs have variable growth rates averaging 0.28 cm/year according to a recent meta-analysis. Larger series with longer follow-up are needed, but a significant number of small tumors appear to be indolent in behavior with a slow growth rate and a limited tendency to progress. The standard of care for improving SRMs is surgery. Up to a third of surgically removed tumors < 4 cm are histologically benign. The results of current surgical treatment of histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma < 4 cm are excellent, but this has not resulted in a reduction in mortality. Based on these considerations and the available data on the natural history of SRMs, it seems reasonable to assume that we may be overtreating these lesions. This is especially true for elderly or unfit patients who have a reduced life expectancy. In these selected patients and in patients who refuse active treatment, it seems reasonable to propose an initial phase of active surveillance for incidental SRM, with delayed intervention for those tumors that show rapid growth during follow-up. Percutaneous needle biopsies of renal tumors can be safely performed using modern techniques and have the potential to characterize SRMs in histological diagnosis, allowing for better selection of the conservative or active treatment that is most appropriate for each individual patient.",0,0,
1851,The role of theory in research to develop and evaluate the implementation of patient safety practices,"Theories provide a way to understand and predict the impact of patient safety practices (PSPs), interventions to prevent or mitigate healthcare harm, or risks of such harm. However, most published evaluations make little or no explicit reference to the theory, hampering efforts to generalize findings from one context to another. Theories from a wide range of disciplines are potentially relevant to research into PSPs. Theory can be used in research to explain clinical and organizational behavior, guide the development and selection of PSPs, and assess their implementation and mechanisms of action. A key recommendation from an expert consensus process is that researchers should describe the theoretical basis for selected intervention components or provide an explicit logic model for ""why this PSP should work"". a cumulative understanding of the nature of change.",0,1,

CHD is a leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in Ireland. Secondary prevention was recommended as a key strategy to reduce CHD mortality, and general practice was highlighted as the ideal setting for secondary prevention initiatives. Current evidence suggests that there is significant room for improvement in the provision of secondary prevention for patients with established heart disease in the island of Ireland. The review literature recommends structured programs with ongoing patient support and follow-up; the provision of training tailored to the needs of practitioners to access evidence of the effectiveness of secondary prevention; structured recall programs that also address individual practice needs;"" and patient-centered consultations, accompanied by adherence to disease management guidelines. METHODS: SPHERE is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with practice-level randomization to intervention and control groups that 960 Patients were recruited from 48 practices in three study centers (Belfast, Dublin and Galway.

1854,The standard of care: A case report and ethical analysis,"Physicians are increasingly allowing their perceived legal responsibilities to override their clinical judgment. Misunderstandings surrounding the term ""standard of care"" have fueled fears of liability and led to defensive medicine. Physicians may view the standard of care as a technical or legal obligation, but an optimal standard would be one based on detailed knowledge of a patient's medical history and personal condition. It would involve the physician's clinical judgment integrating specific technical and legal information with clinical experience in caring for patients. Occasionally, such a judgment may conflict with the judgments of a court that considers technical and legal information without the benefit of clinical judgment. Physicians must be willing to be advocates for their patients, especially when legal proceedings are flawed or harmful. Systematic investigative and analytical techniques, such as those used by ethics advisers, can help clarify questions about the standard of care.",0,0,

1857,The systematic impact of gain- and loss-related messages on interest in and use of different types of health behaviors,"The systematic formulation of health messages in terms of wins or losses affects people's behavior. Rothman and Salovey suggested that the relative impact of win and loss messages depends on perceptions of the risk or uncertainty associated with adopting the recommended behavior. Specifically, loss-related messages are more effective in promoting disease-aware (screening) behaviors, but gain-related messages are more effective in promoting health-affirming (prevention) behaviors. Two experiments provide a direct test of this conceptual framework. In Experiment 1, participants' willingness to act after reading about a new disease depended on how the information was presented and what type of behavior was encouraged. Experiment 2 repeated and expanded these results to include a real health issue - gum disease. Profit-framed brochures increased interest in a plaque-fighting mouthrinse, while loss-framed brochures increased interest in a plaque-detecting disclosure rinse. Message framework research provides a theoretically sound guide to developing effective health messages.",0,1,

The purpose of this study was to design and implement an effective policy formulation, dissemination and implementation program to promote the development of an evidence-based culture in an Israeli HMO. METHOD: The authors implemented a four-step program of incremental collaborations with academic institutions consisting of developing quantitative tools to assess prescribing patterns, updating CPGs, collecting input from MDs via focus groups and quantitative surveys, and conducting a randomized controlled trial of two people consists of -stage, multi-pronged intervention. The test case for this study was the development, dissemination, and implementation of CPG for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in adult women. Interventions in the form of a lecture at a conference and a letter with personalized feedback were both used individually and combined to improve physicians' rates of prescribing the first-line drug, nitrofurantoin, and, when nitrofurantoin is not present, therapy to comply with the recommended treatment duration of three days with ofloxacin. RESULTS: The tools and data-generating capabilities designed and constructed in phase I of the project were integral parts of all subsequent phases of the program. Personalized feedback alone was enough to improve adherence to guidelines by 19.4% (95% CI = 16.7, 22.1).

As the field grows, training programs for D&I research are few; this is an important way to build the capacity of the field. To improve the United States' capacity for D&I research, the National Institutes of Health and Veterans Health Administration have collaborated to develop a five-day training institute for postdoctoral-level applicants who wish to advance this science, Dissemination and Implementation of Research in Health (TIDIRH ) Outcomes The TIDIRH used a five-day immersion in a dormitory to maximize the interaction opportunities for trainees and faculty. The train-the-trainer-like approach was intended to provide participants with materials they could easily use to bring back to their home institutions to facilitate the To increase interest and further invest in D&I, take lessons and interactive sessions in small groups. 35 out of 266 applicants for the first annual training institute were accepted from a variety of disciplines including psychology (12 trainees); Medicine (6 trainees); Epidemiology (5 trainees); Health behavior/health education (4 trainees); and 1 intern each from the fields of Education and Human Development, Health Policy and Management, Health Services Research, Public Health Studies, Public Policy and Social Work, with a maximum of two people from one institution. The institute was rated as very helpful by the participants and six months after the institute a follow-up survey (response rate of 97%) revealed that 72% had initiated a new grant application in D&I research; 28% had received funding, and 77% had used TIDIRH's capabilities to influence their peers across disciplines about D&I research by building local research networks, organizing formal presentations and symposiums, teaching, and interdisciplinary teams to conduct D&I research Research have conducted trainee assessment at the end of the week-long training and six-month follow-up, and there are plans to continue and possibly expand the TIDIRH in the coming years.

1861,The UPBEAT program for depression and coronary artery disease: using the UK Medical Research Council framework to develop a nurse-led complex intervention for use in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a common feature of coronary artery disease (CAD) and increases the incidence of coronary artery symptoms and death in CAD patients. Interventions that are feasible for use in primary care are needed to improve both mood and cardiac outcomes. The UPBEAT-UK research program was funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to investigate the relationship between CHD and depression and to develop a new intervention for use in primary care. METHODS: Using Medical Research Council (MRC) guidelines for designing and evaluating complex interventions, we conducted a systematic review and qualitative research to evaluate a primary care-based, nurse-led intervention to improve mood and cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD and to develop depression. An iterative literature review was used to synthesize our empirical work and identify evidence and theories to inform the intervention. RESULTS: We developed a primary care-based, nurse-led, personalized care intervention that leverages elements of case management to promote self-management. After a biopsychosocial assessment, a personalized treatment plan is created. Nurses trained in behavior change techniques help clients address issues that are important to them. The identification and use of existing resources is promoted. Care time is saved by telephone follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Applying the MRC framework to complex interventions has allowed us to develop an evidence-based intervention based on patient and clinician preferences and established theory.

1862,The use of computerized reminders of birthday greetings in the management of diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Although reminder emails have been used for prevention in the general population, few studies have evaluated their effectiveness in chronically ill populations. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of postal reminders in improving diabetes management. The reminder included a letter from the person's primary care physician (PCP), a self-care manual, a preventive checklist, and specific recommendations for receiving routine monitoring and screening. METHODS: Of 195 primary care physicians practicing in a large group practice, 111 agreed to have their adult diabetic patients randomized to receive reminder (n = 1,641) or usual (n = 1,668) care. Using data from automated databases, we fit generalized estimating equations to estimate the effect of reminder receipt on fasting lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin tests, receipt of the dilated retinal exam, and visit frequency during the 6 and 12 months post-randomization, and glycated hemoglobin and assess cholesterol levels in the year after randomization. RESULTS: Reminder and normal care recipients did not differ in sociodemographic, clinical, or prior test characteristics. In the 6 months after randomization, reminder recipients were more likely to receive a retinal exam (odds ratio [OR], 1.29"", 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.12 to 1.49) and a visit for diabetes (OR , 1.28; 95. % CI, 1.12 to 1.47) In the 12 months after randomization, reminder recipients were more likely to receive a glycated hemoglobin test (OR 1.21; 95% CI 1.03 to 1 .43) and a retinal exam (OR, 1.23; 95% CI. , 1.07 to 1.41) and diabetes visit (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.29). reminder recipients also tended to have a glycated hemoglobin test that did not reflect a poor control (<9.5%) CONCLUSIONS: We found small but significant improvements in the management of patients with diabetes who received a computerized reminder in the mail.",0,1,

Simulation is a powerful training tool because it allows the trainer to systematically control the schedule of exercises, the presentation of feedback, and the introduction (or suppression) of environmental distractions within a safe, controlled learning environment. Unfortunately, many in the training community have started using the terms simulation and high-fidelity simulation almost interchangeably. This is unfortunate as it puts too much emphasis on instructional technology at the expense of more substantive aspects such as the objectives, content and design of the training. It also perpetuates several myths: simulation fidelity is one-dimensional, or higher simulation fidelity leads to increased training effectiveness. The authors propose a simulation fidelity typology and provide examples of how the different simulation classes have been successfully used to train teamwork in high-risk industries. Guidelines are also provided to maximize the use of simulation for healthcare team skill training.",0,0,
1865,The use of the nicotine inhaler in smoking cessation,"PURPOSE: To raise awareness of the nicotine inhaler among Nursing Practitioners (NPs) by providing clinical and practical information on the use of the nicotine inhaler as a treatment option for smoking cessation. DATA SOURCES: This included data-based and review articles in the medical literature, the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Tobacco Use and Addiction, and the Medline and Cinahl search engines. Criteria for the search terms were “nicotine inhaler” and “nicotine replacement therapy”. The first search was conducted in December 2004. CONCLUSIONS: The nicotine inhaler was tested to be safe and effective in the treatment of tobacco cessation. Clinical studies show that the nicotine inhaler is useful alone or as an adjunct to other pharmacological therapies. Current national guidelines recommend the use of nicotine inhalers in smoking cessation therapy. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The nicotine inhaler is suitable for a wide variety of smokers, including certain types of cardiac patients. NPs may include the nicotine inhaler in a group of nicotine replacement therapies to ensure smokers are successful in quitting tobacco.",0,0,
1866,The use of appropriate osteoporosis medication improves after a multifaceted educational effort: the Canadian Quality Circle Project (CQC),"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a serious but treatable disease. However, adequate therapeutic use of the disease remains suboptimal. Therefore, the aim of the study was to change physicians' therapy delivery behavior in accordance with the Osteoporosis Canada 2002 guidelines. METHODS: The project was a two-year cohort study consisting of five Quality Circle (QC) phases that included: 1) Training and baseline data collection, 2) Initial pedagogical intervention and initial follow-up data collection, 3) Initial strategy implementation session, 4) Final pedagogical intervention and final follow-up data collection; and 5) Final strategy implementation session. A total of 340 general practitioners formed 34 QCs and participated in the study. Physicians analyzed a total of 8376, 7354, and 3673 randomly selected patient records at baseline, follow-up #1, and last follow-up, respectively. The patients were divided into three groups"";"" the high-risk, low-risk, and low-risk non-fracture groups. The generalized estimating equation technique was used to model the change in physicians' outcomes over time: the probability of appropriate therapy was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.46) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1, 20, 1.66) in patients in the high-risk group, 1.15 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.36) and 1.16 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.44) in the low-risk group, and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.43) and 1.23 (95% CI: 0.97). , 1.55) in the low-risk group with no fractures at follow-up #1 or the last follow-up.

1867,"The value of a ""gentle reminder"" of safe medical behavior","Background Based on findings and methods from cognitive psychology and behavioral economics, we have introduced ""gentle memory"". This process requires a public plan of safety standards and an agreement by all team members to help each other comply with this plan. Methods Team members agree to gently remind their employees whenever they deviate from the safety norm. For the study, we observed the use of gloves during intravenous insertion and blood collection. Results and Discussion During the 2-year follow-up, safe behavior increased when safe behavior was 55% prior to the implementation of 'soft reminder' on a ward; it rose to over 80% after 2 months; 2 months later, it was 83% and 90%;"" and finally it stabilized at 90%. A similar pattern was documented in all wards. This is a recommended way to overcome unsafe behavior.",0,1,
1868,Theory and practice in the treatment of depressive disorders,"Scientific, professional and governmental bodies have in recent years intensified their efforts to formulate guidelines for the treatment of depression with the aim that medical practice conforms to these standards and thus improves patient care. ""Evidence-based medicine"" requires that medical practice explicitly refers to the best available scientific knowledge. Empirical data on nursing epidemiology suggest that there are major differences between guidelines and routine practice. The inability to recognize mental disorders is between 45 and 90%. Only 1 in 10 depressed patients receive adequate treatment. Treatment is inadequate, with prescribed dosages routinely being too low, up to 50% of treatments being terminated prematurely, and patient non-compliance compromising the proper use of treatment. Psychological treatment occurs in only 60% of cases of need and is mostly non-specific, ie listening or advisory. In addition, there are large regional differences in prescribing patterns, showing that treatment is influenced by many non-medical factors. Empirical studies show that educating doctors or even measures to improve detection alone are not enough to change treatment behavior. Only if measures are taken to directly improve treatment interventions could a better course of the disease be shown, at least for more severe cases. To understand therapist non-adherence to treatment guidelines, one must first understand the medical decision-making process. Action theory offers a model that brings together theoretical and experimental knowledge, goal setting, medical and emotional evaluation, and operational procedures. Based on this theory, future guidelines should specify the setting for which they claim validity, they should be tested empirically for their feasibility and implications for patient outcome, and they should give due attention to non-medical factors that have a major impact on the medical practice.",0,0,
1869,Therapeutic Enhancement: Nursing intervention category for patients diagnosed as being ready for therapeutic regimen management,"OBJECTIVES: To introduce a new nursing intervention category called therapeutic enhancement. BACKGROUND: Fewer than half of North Americans follow their doctor's recommendations for diet and exercise, even when they are critical to their health or recovery. It is imperative that caregivers consider new ways to promote healthy behaviors. Therapeutic reinforcement aims to offer such a fresh approach. Traditional intervention techniques that focus on education, contracting, social support, and more frequent interaction with physicians do not appear to be effective on their own. Successful strategies were multidisciplinary"";"" and have included interventions by professional nurses to help patients understand their disease and the disease process, and to help them develop disease management and self-management skills. Therapeutic improvement includes The Stages of Change Theory, Commitment to Health Theory, motivational interviewing techniques, and tools specifically designed for the process evaluation of health-promoting interventions. METHOD: This is a critical review of approaches not previously synthesized in a single published article. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the commonly used model of stages of change, therapeutic enhancement is useful for patients who are in the action phase of change. Using therapeutic enhancement and therapeutic strategies identified in Stages of Change theory, such as Using techniques such as emergency management, relationship support, counterconditioning, stimulus control, and motivational interviewing techniques, nurses can significantly increase patients' chances of moving from the action phase to the maintenance phase of change for a given health behavior. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Using the Nursing Intervention category, therapeutic enhancement can increase the success of nurses in assisting patients to maintain healthy behaviors.",0,0,
1870,Therapy and supportive care for alcoholics: guidelines for practitioners,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alcoholism is a widespread disorder in our societies. However, only a small percentage of alcoholics enter specialized psychotherapeutic treatment programs. The vast majority are consulted by general practitioners or experts in other medical specialties, where they receive intensive treatment for their alcohol-related comorbidities. But the cause of these comorbidities, alcoholism itself, is rarely addressed. This article provides specialists and laypersons with guidelines on how these patients can be treated correctly in non-specific therapy programs and how motivation for abstinence can be increased. In addition, the concept can be quickly and easily integrated into the everyday life of every therapeutic team. Methods: The literature on the therapeutic methods of brief interventions, motivational interviewing and pharmacological relapse prevention was reviewed in PubMed for the years 1991-2005. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The disease burden of alcoholism and alcohol abuse as primary disorders is very obvious, but is often underestimated even by therapists of different medical specialties. Systematic studies of the brief intervention method, motivational interviewing, and also pharmacological treatment with acamprosate have shown that they are potent methods that can easily be used to increase the duration of abstinence and the motivation of patients to participate in further specific treatments .",0,0,

METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted for articles reporting the use of 3DUS or 4DUS in obstetrics. Seven hundred and six articles were identified, of which 525 actually related to the subject of this review. Articles describing technical developments, clinical studies, reviews, editorials, and studies on fetal behavior or maternal-fetal bonding were reviewed. RESULTS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for the diagnosis of facial abnormalities, especially facial clefts. There is also evidence that 3DUS provides additional diagnostic information in neural tube defects and skeletal malformations. Large studies comparing 2DUS and 3DUS for diagnosis of congenital anomalies have not provided conclusive results. Preliminary evidence suggests that sonographic tomography can reduce obstetric ultrasound examination time with minimal impact on visualization rates of anatomical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional ultrasound provides additional diagnostic information for the diagnosis of facial anomalies, the assessment of neural tube defects, and skeletal malformations. Further research is needed to determine the clinical role of 3DUS and 4DUS in the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and central nervous system abnormalities. Future studies should clarify whether the information contained in the volume dataset alone is sufficient to evaluate fetal biometric measurements and diagnose congenital anomalies.",0,0,

1875,Tics in the pediatric population: Pragmatic management,"BACKGROUND: Primary tic disorders, particularly Tourette syndrome, are very common movement disorders in childhood. However, the treatment of such patients still poses major therapeutic challenges for physicians. METHODS: Based on a synthesis of the available guidelines published in Europe, Canada and the United States coupled with recent therapeutic developments, the authors provide a pragmatic guide to help clinicians decide when and how to treat patients with primary Tic disorders to be treated . RESULTS: After a systematic survey of tics and common neuropsychiatric comorbidities (primarily attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]), the first treatment step is comprehensive psychoeducation of patients and families that addresses the protean phenomenology of tics and associated behaviors , coping mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options. When a more active intervention beyond vigilant surveillance is indicated, a hierarchical assessment of treatment goals (i.e., tics vs. comorbid behavioral symptoms) is critical. Behavioral treatments for tics are limited to older children and are not available in all centers, mainly due to the lack of well-trained therapists. Pharmacologic treatments, such as antipsychotics for tics, stimulants and atomoxetine for ADHD, and alpha2A agonists for children with tics plus ADHD, are widely available and effective treatment options, but safety needs to be monitored. Combined polypharmacological and behavioral/pharmacological approaches as well as neuromodulation strategies are underexplored in this patient population. Conclusions: The treatment of children with tics and Tourette's syndrome is diverse. Multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, psychiatry, psychology and pediatrics can be helpful in addressing the complex needs of these children.",0,0,
1876,"Tobacco Brief Intervention Training for Chiropractors, Acupuncture and Massage Practitioners: Protocol for the CAM-Reach Study","BACKGROUND: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Effective tobacco cessation tools are widely available but underused. Brief tobacco cessation interventions (BIs) increase smoking cessation rates. However, BI training has focused on conventional medical providers and overlooked other healthcare practitioners with regular exposure to tobacco users. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey found that approximately 20% of those using provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are tobacco users. Therefore, CAM practitioners potentially represent a major untapped community resource to promote tobacco cessation and the use of effective cessation aids. Existing BI training is not well suited to the background and practice patterns of CAM practitioners, as they assume a conventional biomedical knowledge base and philosophical approaches to health, healing, and the patient-physician relationship. There is an urgent need to develop and test the effectiveness of BI training that is both based on Public Health Service (PHS) guidelines for tobacco addiction treatment and relevant and appropriate for CAM practitioners. METHODS/DESIGN: The CAM Reach (CAMR) Intervention is a BI smoking cessation training and office system intervention specifically tailored for chiropractors, acupuncturists, and massage therapists. The CAMR study uses a single-group, one-way crossover design to examine the impact of CAMR intervention on tobacco-related practice behaviors of CAM practitioners. Primary endpoints included CAM practitioner self-reported screening for tobacco use and BIs. Secondary endpoints included tobacco users' willingness to quit, attempts to quit smoking, use of guideline-based treatments and smoking cessation rates, and non-smoking patients' actions to help someone else quit. DISCUSSION: CAM practitioners serve a significant number of tobacco users. Their practice patterns and philosophical approaches to health and healing lend themselves well to delivering BIs. The CAMR study examines the impact of the CAMR intervention on practitioners' tobacco-related practice behaviors, the behaviors of CAM patients, and documents factors important for conducting practice-based research in real-world CAM practices.",0,0,
1877,Tobacco cessation in primary care: maximizing intervention strategies,"The most effective preventive intervention a clinician can offer to tobacco-using patients for heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an empathetic, personalized smoking cessation intervention program with enhanced support and follow-up. The goal of the intervention must be complete smoking cessation. The reduction offers no direct health benefits to the individual smoker. Interventions are readily available but underutilized, in part due to a lack of clinical training and organizational support. This article summarizes the current guidelines for smoking cessation interventions as a framework to work from. The guidelines include the transtheoretical model of patient behavior change and the ""Five A's"": Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist and Arrange. Pharmacotherapeutic agents, including nicotine replacement therapies (nicotine gum, patches, nasal sprays, inhalers, and new therapies) and nicotine-free therapies (bupropion, clonidine, nortriptyline, and other antidepressants and anxiolytics) are considered. Compliance validation methods, new approaches to tobacco and addiction treatment that appear in the recent research literature are reviewed. Beyond this framework, specific categories of tobacco users (including smokeless tobacco users), cultural and ethnic minorities, youth who use snuff and bidis, women, Medicaid recipients, and users of multiple forms of tobacco deserve special attention. With this framework and the modifications that may be required for specific patient categories, practicing clinicians can incorporate a successful tobacco cessation intervention program with smoking cessation rates of nearly 20% into their daily practice.",0,0,

1879,Tobacco cessation training for complementary and alternative medicine practitioners: results from a practice-based study,"INTRODUCTION: Brief behavioral intervention (BI) is a proven method for smoking cessation that is well established among conventional health practitioners. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners treat a significant number of tobacco users, but receive no systematic BI training. The CAM-Reach study developed and evaluated a BI tobacco cessation training program/exercise system that was specifically adapted for CAM practitioners and evaluated in real CAM practices. STUDY DESIGN: One-arm intervention. Data was collected in 2010-2014 and analyzed in 2015. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Private practices of 30 chiropractors, 27 acupuncturists, 42 massage therapists (N=99) in metropolitan Tucson, Arizona. INTERVENTION: 8-hour BI continuing education workshop on smoking cessation, practice/assessment of BI skills in practice and systems intervention. Training tailored to the CAM practice setting addressed tobacco cessation best practices from US Public Health Service guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seventeen items (assessment of practitioner's behavior, motivation, and self-efficacy in smoking cessation) encompassing three factors, tobacco cessation activity, tobacco cessation motivation, and non-CAM tobacco cessation comfort, were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the training through the self-report of the practitioner. Research staff visited practices at roughly even intervals to directly observe changes in clinical practice systems. RESULTS: At 3 months, there was a significant increase in practitioners' tobacco cessation activities, motivation and confidence in helping patients quit tobacco, and comfort in providing information and recommendations for guideline-based tobacco cessation aids (p<0.0001 ). Practitioners resulted in significantly higher rates of discussing smoking cessation medication with patients (AOR = 3.76, 95% CI = 1.84, 7.68) and routinely asking about tobacco use in clinical practice (AOR = 2.62, 95 %CI = 1.11, 6.20). Increases occurred in all three types of practitioners and persisted after 12 months - despite the heterogeneity in professional training, practice patterns / organization and practice business models. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that CAM practitioners are willing and able to provide BIs and that they are an important but overlooked channel for promoting tobacco cessation and the use of evidence-based cessation aids.",0,0,
1880,Tobacco Addiction Treatment Guidelines,"Tobacco addiction causes every sixth death in the Czech Republic and is associated with diseases of the whole body. Treatment of tobacco dependence should be an integral part of clinical care within the time available, from brief intervention at each clinical contact with patients to intensive care. It includes psychosocial behavioral support and pharmacotherapy. It should apply to all clinical medicine professions – as recommended by WHO, mainly doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists – and be covered within healthcare systems. Economically, it is one of the most cost-effective interventions in medicine.

1881,Tobacco Intervention Practices by Licensed Psychologists,"Tobacco addiction is a serious public health problem. The US Department of Health and Human Services has issued a best practice guideline to encourage all healthcare providers to intervene with tobacco dependent individuals they encounter. Psychologists may be ideally suited to deliver brief tobacco interventions because of their expertise in behavior change strategies and interpersonal counseling skills. The aim of this study was to examine current tobacco assessment and intervention practices and perceptions of accountability for tobacco intervention among a regional sample of licensed, practicing psychologists. The results suggest that a majority of psychologists fall far short of the ideal best practices recommended in the practice guideline, and many are unaware that the guidelines are available. Additionally, the psychologists in this study viewed tobacco intervention as a greater responsibility of physicians and other health care providers than psychologists and other mental health professionals.",0,0,
1882,Tobacco smoking in individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: epidemiology and pharmacological approaches to cessation,"The co-occurrence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine addiction is common. Individuals with ADHD are more likely to start smoking and become dependent on nicotine than their non-ADHD counterparts, and recent evidence suggests they may have more difficulty quitting. Little is known about how best to manage these comorbidities to optimize clinical outcome. Clinicians treating individuals with ADHD or nicotine dependence should be aware of their common coexistence and the need to consider both in treatment. This review of ADHD and nicotine dependence provides an overview of relevant epidemiology, bidirectional interactions, and implications for pharmacological and concomitant psychosocial treatment. Incorporating the current evidence base and their clinical experience, the authors propose a stepwise approach to treating patients with comorbid ADHD and nicotine dependence. Given the potential of ADHD symptoms to interfere with smoking cessation success, the first priority is to stabilize ADHD. The first-line pharmacologic approach should be a long-acting psychostimulant. After ADHD stabilization, motivational techniques should be used to encourage willingness to try smoking cessation. In the context of behavioral smoking cessation interventions that address the patient's needs and developmental stage, a pharmacologic intervention aimed at smoking cessation can be initiated. The authors recommend varenicline as the drug of first choice due to its superior potency among available drug treatments. Symptoms of ADHD and nicotine withdrawal and craving symptoms should be closely monitored during the cessation attempt, and therapy adjustments should be considered if warranted. The authors conclude that while current treatments may be effective for comorbid ADHD and nicotine dependence, further research is needed to analyze the complex relationships between these disorders and to prospectively investigate combined treatments.",0,0,
1883,Tobacco-nicotine education and training for health care students and practitioners: a systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic review was to examine what characteristics of education and training prepare and support healthcare professionals (HCPs) to provide competent and effective care to patients who use tobacco nicotine. METHODS: A search of eight bibliographic databases for English-language peer-reviewed publications from January 2006 to March 2015. Studies were included if they met a priori inclusion criteria, which consisted of: 1) quantitative study design, and 2) focus on tobacco -Nicotine education or training for HCP students and practitioners. All studies were independently reviewed for inclusion by two reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted for study characteristics and key outcomes and then critically assessed for methodological quality. Results: 59 studies were included for narrative synthesis. Two categories emerged: 1) curriculum features (n=10) and 2) education and training interventions (n=49). The included curriculum studies identified the following themes: content, intensity, competency assessment, and barriers. Study outcomes on education and training interventions were grouped by educational level (pre-licensing, post-licensing, and faculty training), instructional modality, health discipline, and associated HCP and client outcomes. Conclusion: This comprehensive review suggests a lack of consistency in the characteristics of tobacco-nicotine education and training for HCPs. This paper provides a valuable categorization of the most commonly used components of the academic curriculum and discusses the interventions in relation to HCP and client outcomes. Gaps in the literature are identified and the need for standardization of tobacco-nicotine training competencies and assessments is discussed. Future research examining the most effective training approaches is needed.

However, researchers and implementers are unlikely to apply measures unless they are also pragmatic. The aim of this study was to establish a stakeholder-driven conceptualization of the domains that comprise the pragmatic measurement construct. It built on a systematic literature review and semi-structured stakeholder interviews that generated 47 pragmatic action criteria and aimed to further refine this set of criteria by identifying conceptually distinct categories of the pragmatic action construct and providing quantitative assessments of the criteria. ¯s clarity and meaning. Methods Twenty-four stakeholders with experience in implementation practice conducted a concept mapping activity in which they grouped the initial list of 47 criteria into conceptually distinct categories and rated their clarity and importance. Multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results The 47 criteria were meaningfully grouped into four distinct categories: (1) acceptable, (2) compatible, (3) simple, and (4) useful. Average ratings of clarity and importance at the category and each criterion level are presented. Conclusions This study advances the field of implementation science and practice by providing clear and conceptually distinct domains of the pragmatic measurement construct. Next steps will include a Delphi process to build consensus on key criteria and to develop quantifiable pragmatic evaluation criteria that can be used to evaluate interventions.",0,0,
1888,Towards evidence-based medical statistics. 1: The P-value fallacy,"There is an important problem with the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research hardly play a formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon manifests itself in the discussion sections of research articles and can ultimately affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions with certain ""error rates"" can be generated without considering information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are p-values and hypothesis testing, is widely regarded as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little recognition in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, the usefulness of which for scientific conclusions has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for nearly 70 years. This article presents some of the key elements of this debate and traces the appeal and detrimental effects of this method to the P-value fallacy, the misconception that a single number can capture both the long-term results of an experiment and the conclusive meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that a different standard of proof should be used - the Bayesian factor, which properly separates questions of long-term behavior from evidentiary weight and allows for the integration of background knowledge with statistical insights.",0,0,

This limits the performance of evidence synthesis, hinders communication and collaboration, and undermines the knowledge translation of research results in different settings. Improving the consistency of terminology could help address these challenges. In 2012, we convened an international working group to explore the idea of developing a common terminology and overarching framework for knowledge translation interventions. Results Methods included identifying and summarizing existing frameworks, mapping a subset of these frameworks, and convening a multidisciplinary group to begin consensus work. The group considered four possible approaches to creating a simplified framework: merging existing taxonomies, creating a framework of intervention mechanisms instead of intervention strategies, using a consensus process to extend one of the existing models/frames used by the group, or developing a new consensus framework . Conclusions The working group decided to draft a new, simplified consensus framework for action to promote and integrate evidence into health practices, systems and policies. The framework will include four key components: strategies and techniques (agents), how they work (causal mechanisms), how they are delivered (mode of delivery), and what they aim to change (intended goals). The draft framework needs to be further developed through feedback and consultation with the research community and tested for its usefulness through application and evaluation.",0,0,

1891,tracheostomy and weaning,"No hypothesis regarding respiratory care in the ICU has been more difficult to objectively test than the commonly held assumption that tracheostomy accelerates weaning from ventilator support. Tracheostomy may facilitate weaning by reducing dead space and reducing airway resistance, improving secretion clearance, reducing the need for sedation, and reducing the risk of aspiration. Available evidence suggests that dead space and airway resistance are indeed reduced, although whether the magnitude of these reductions explains the clinical observation of faster weaning after tracheostomy is less certain. Most of the data on this topic comes from laboratory experiments and short-term physiological studies in clinically stable patients, and the available evidence from clinical trials with weaning as the primary endpoint is sparse. A large multicenter study showed no benefit from early tracheostomy but demonstrated the difficulty of getting clinicians to treat their patients with therapies that contradict their firm beliefs. The most recent clinical study found that percutaneous dilated tracheotomy performed in the first 2 days in patients expected to require >14 days of ventilator support greatly reduced ventilator days and ICU days, and both the incidence of pneumonia and the All-cause mortality compared to decreased tracheostomy after day 14. Conducting such studies is difficult due to investigator and clinician bias, the inability to predict which patients will actually require prolonged mechanical ventilation, and several other factors discussed in this article. The tracheotomy likely helps relieve some patients from ventilator support, but this may be due to both its effect on clinical behavior and physiological implications.",0,0,
1892,Tracing the foundations of a conceptual framework for a patient safety ontology,"Background Working for the World Alliance for Patient Safety on research methodologies and policies, as well as defining key concepts for an International Classification of Patient Safety (ICPS), it became clear that there was a need to try to understand what patient safety means and what lies behind the concepts relate to the existing safety and quality frameworks commonly used in healthcare. Objectives To demonstrate the concept of patient safety and its relationship to safety and quality frameworks commonly used in healthcare, and to follow the development of the ICPS framework as a basis for electronic recording of the component elements of patient safety. Conclusion The ICPS Patient Safety Framework has its origins in existing frameworks and an international consultation process. Although its 10 classes and their semantic relationships can be used as a reference model for various disciplines, it must remain dynamic in the ever-changing world of healthcare. By expanding the ICPS by examining data from all available sources and ensuring strict adherence to the latest principles in informatics, a deeper interdisciplinary approach is gradually being developed to tackle the complex, intractable problem of reducing harm to health.",0,0,

After training, one condition included training to improve mental flexibility and the other included training in practical knowledge and skills related to pain management. The study involved 81 general practitioners (GPs), each randomly assigned to 1 of the training conditions. It proved easy to recruit GPs for the training. Overall, primary care physicians showed increased knowledge of prescribing opioids for chronic pain and fewer concerns about prescribing after training. However, no changes were observed in reported prescribing practices or in secondary measures of well-being. There were also no significant differences between the training conditions, apart from a greater increase in intent to use the prescription guidelines in the psychological flexibility condition. Feasibility and acceptance of the training methods were generally rated highly. The psychological flexibility condition was rated higher in terms of interest and satisfaction than the comparison condition. Finally, pre- and post-training processes of psychological flexibility correlated significantly with measures of GP well-being, partially supporting the relevance of these processes as a focus in GP education. PERSPECTIVE: A general practitioner education intervention, including education on opioid guidelines for chronic pain and psychological flexibility training, increased prescribing knowledge and reduced concern, but did not alter prescribing behavior or well-being. The training was very acceptable for general practitioners but may have been too short to produce other effects.",0,0,

1897,Training practitioners to provide opportunistic advice on multiple behavior change in primary care: a randomized cluster study,"OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of training primary care professionals in behavior change counseling on the proportion of patients self-reporting a change in four risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, exercise, and healthy eating). DESIGN Cluster-randomized study with primary care practices as the randomization unit. SETTING General practices in Wales. PARTICIPANTS 53 general practitioners and practice nurses from 27 general practices (one each in all practices but one) recruited 1827 patients who tested positive for at least one risky behavior. INTERVENTION Behavior change counseling was developed from motivational conversations to enable physicians to increase patients' motivation to change health-related behaviors. Clinicians were trained using a blended learning program called Talking Lifestyles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Percentage of patients reporting beneficial changes in at least one of the four risky behaviors after three months. RESULTS 1308 patients from 13 intervention and 1496 from 14 control practices were contacted: 76% and 72% agreed to participate, respectively, with 831 (84%) and 996 (92%) being candidates for an intervention, respectively. There was no effect on the primary endpoint (beneficial behavior change) at three months (362 (44%) vs. 404 (41%), odds ratio 1.12 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.39)) or biochemical or biometric measurements after 12 months. More patients who consulted trained physicians recalled a health behavior counseling session (724/795 (91%) versus 531/966 (55%), odds ratio 12.44 (5.85 to 26.46) ) and intended to change it (599/831 (72%) vs. 491/996 (49%), odds ratio 2.88 (2.05 to 4.05)). More intervention practice patients reported an attempt at change (328 (39%) vs. 317 (32%), odds ratio 1.40 (1.15 to 1.70)), sustained behavior change at three months (288 (35%) vs. 280 (28%), odds ratio 1.36 (1.11 to 1.65)) and reported slightly larger improvements in healthy eating at 3 and 12 months, and improved activity at 12 months. Training cost £1597 per exercise. DISCUSSION Training primary care physicians in behavior change counseling using a brief blended learning program did not increase patients reporting beneficial behavior changes at three months or improve biometric and biochemical measurements at 12 months, but it did increase patients' recall, Discuss behavioral changes with physicians, intentions to change, attempts to change, and perceptions of having made a lasting change after three months. Lasting behavior change and improvements in biometric measurements are unlikely after a single routine consultation with a physician trained in behavior change counseling without additional intervention.

1898,Transforming an assertive community treatment into an integrated system of care: the role of partnerships between nursing and primary care,"Despite the high rate of co-occurring illness among individuals receiving assertive community treatment (ACT), this comprehensive service model continues to be viewed primarily as a mental health intervention. Without compromising fidelity to the model, ACT can serve as an ideal platform from which to deliver both primary and behavioral health care to people with complex service needs. Using a case study, this article considers the transformation of the ACT model of mental health care into an integrated health care system through the development of partnerships between nursing and primary care. Specifically, by expanding and explicitly redefining the role of the ACT caregiver, well-developed models of care such as guided care can provide additional guidance and training for ACT caregivers who are specifically trained and aligned to act as leaders and coordinators of health integration efforts.",0,0,

DESIGN: Natural experiment with nonparticipating institutions serving as controls. SETTING: Community nursing homes. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six participating and 353 nonparticipating care facilities in North Carolina. INTERVENTION: Two in-person learning sessions, monthly conference calls, and email discussion list over 9 months. The package of amendments emphasized screening, labeling and reducing risk factors. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence was measured using facility self-report and chart abstraction (n=832) before and after the intervention. As an exploratory result, the fall rates measured with the Minimum Data Set (MDS) were compared with those of non-participating institutions. RESULTS: Self-reported compliance with screening, labeling, and risk factor reduction approached 100%. Graph abstraction revealed only modest improvements in screening (51% to 68%, p<0.05), reduction in risk factors (4% to 7%, p=0.30), and medication assessment (2% to 6%, p = 0.05). .34). There was a significant increase in vitamin D prescriptions (40% to 48%, p=0.03) and a decrease in sedative hypnotics (19% to 12%, p=0.04), but no change in Use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, or calcium. There were no significant changes in proportions of falls or fall rates according to chart abstraction (28.6% to 37.5%, P=0.17), MDS (18.2% to 15.4%, P=0.56) or self-report (6.1–) observed. 5.6 falls/1,000 bed days, P=0.31). CONCLUSION: Tasks aimed at reducing multiple risk factors are rarely implemented, while screening tasks appear more easily modifiable in a real setting.

1903,Translation of alcohol screening and brief intervention guidelines for pediatric trauma centers,"BACKGROUND: As part of the American College of Surgeons' verification as a Level 1 trauma center, centers must be able to identify trauma patients with risky alcohol use and provide an intervention. Despite supporting scientific evidence and national policy statements promoting alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral for treatment (SBIRT), barriers still exist that prevent the integration of SBIRT into clinical care. The study objectives of this multi-site, translational research study were to identify best practices for integrating SBIRT services into the routine care of pediatric trauma patients, measure changes in practice in adopting and implementing a SBIRT policy, and identify barriers and opportunities for the Adoption and implementation to define SBIRT services in pediatric trauma centers. METHODS: This translational research study was conducted over a 3-year period at seven US pediatric trauma centers. Changes in SBIRT practice were measured through self-reports and medical record review at three distinct study phases, namely adoption, implementation, and maintenance phases. RESULTS: Based on medical record review, 11% of eligible patients at all sites were screened at baseline and received brief intervention (if needed). Upon completion of the SBIRT technical support activities, all seven participating trauma centers had effectively developed, adopted and implemented SBIRT guidelines for injured adolescent hospitalized patients. Additionally, 73% of eligible patients across all locations received SBIRT services after both the implementation and maintenance phases. Opportunities and barriers to successful integration were identified. CONCLUSION: This model can serve as a method for putting SBIRT services into practice in pediatric trauma centers.",0,0,

We have developed a technique for translating a comprehensive set of appropriateness criteria into a usable set of practice guidelines. The criteria are derived from a formal RAND consensus process and relate to the indications for coronary artery bypass graft surgery for acute myocardial infarction. The clinical indications defined by the panel of experts are entered as conditions in a decision table. For each combination of relevant clinical findings, the recommended action is defined from the median ranking of the fringe panel. The fully constructed table is next condensed and sorted by conventional decision table techniques to facilitate analyzing the knowledge. Ultimately, 8 narrative statements are derived from 51 rules.

DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This qualitative study was conducted with 10 health organizations participating in a voluntary, interprofessional obesity management collaboration. A targeted sample of 39 participants included two to three clinicians and one administrator from each organization. The interview analysis focused on how the intervention affected the participants and their practices. RESULTS: Four themes described participants' experiences with translation of the obesity guideline: (1) a shift from powerlessness to positive motivation, (2) heightened awareness coupled with improved responsiveness, (3) personal responsibility and use of creativity, and (4 ) a Sense of the importance of increased interprofessional collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: The examination of interprofessional perspectives sheds light on the feelings and perceptions of the clinical and administrative participants regarding the translation of the obesity practice guideline. These themes suggest that positive motivation, enhanced capacity, personal creative ownership, and interprofessional collaboration can be conducive to successful implementation of the evidence-based obesity guideline.

1907,Trap of trends to statistical significance: Probability that a near-significant P-value becomes more significant with additional data,"Given a P-value that has not reached a certain threshold (generally P < 0.05), authors of scientific articles may imply a ""trend toward statistical significance"" or otherwise suggest that it is not statistical Reaching significance was due to insufficient data. This paper presents a quantitative analysis to show that such descriptions are misleading and undermine the principle of accurate reporting. P-values that do not reach the conventional significance level of PâÂ¤0.05 are regularly reported as moving in that direction. Expressions such as ""near/approaching statistical significance"" or, most tellingly, a ""trend toward statistical significance"" continue to find their way into publications in journals with high impact factors.1 In this article, we examine and evaluate the mathematical basis for this assumption the extent to which a near-significant P-value can predict movement toward a future significant P-value by adding additional data. We also examine the likelihood that additional data would actually yield a significant result, and finally the confidence one might have that a repeat experiment would independently yield statistically significant results. The clearest context in which to consider the correct interpretation of a P-value is within a randomized trial. Fisher described how the ""simple precaution of randomization is sufficient to ensure the validity of the significance test."" Explain result between groups. The AP value tells us the extent to which chance alone can explain the observed difference, and serves as a ""snapshot"" measure of the strength of evidence at the end of the study.

1909,"Treating depression within the HIV ""medical home"": a guided algorithm for antidepressant treatment by HIV clinicians","People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) suffer from an increased prevalence of depression compared to the general population, negatively impacting antiretroviral (ART) compliance and HIV-related outcomes and leading to morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, depression in this population group often goes unrecognized and untreated. The current project aimed to design an evidence-based approach to integrate treatment for depression into HIV clinics. The model chosen, measurement-based care (MBC), is based on existing guidelines and the largest randomized study in the treatment of depression. MBC was adapted to the clinical realities of HIV treatment for use in a randomized controlled depression management efficacy study at three academic HIV clinics. The adjustment accounts for drug interactions, which are critical to the continued effectiveness of ART, and can be performed by a multidisciplinary team of non-psychiatric providers. A treatment algorithm was developed that allows clinically supervised, nonphysician depression care managers (DCMs) to track and monitor antidepressant tolerability and treatment response, while assisting nonpsychiatric prescribers in antidepressant drug selection and dosing. The quality of care is ensured through weekly supervision of DCMs by psychiatrists. Key areas of flexibility important to implementation included flexibility in the timing of assessments, accommodating discrepancies between algorithm recommendations and vendor decisions, and accommodating delays in the implementation of treatment plans. This adaptation of the MBC model to HIV care has addressed critical antidepressant-antiretroviral interactions and facilitated the delivery of quality antidepressant management in the HIV medical facility.",0,0,

1912,Treatment of anxiety disorders in the primary care setting: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are prevalent in primary care settings. Psychological treatment is effective but time-consuming, and there are waiting lists for secondary care. Therefore, interest has grown in developing treatment guidelines that would be feasible in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and feasibility of guided self-help, the Dutch College of General Practitioners' anxiety disorder guidelines, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of 12 weeks with 3 and 9 months follow-up for primary care patients with panic disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. SETTING: The first two treatment regimens were administered by 46 general practitioners who were randomly assigned to one regimen or another. CBT was performed by cognitive behavioral therapists in a psychiatric outpatient clinic. METHOD: Participants (n = 154) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment modalities. The state subscale of the Spielberger anxiety inventory was used as the main outcome measure. RESULTS: All three treatment modalities resulted in a significant improvement between pre- and post-test, and this improvement remained stable between post-test and follow-up visits. The results obtained with the three forms of treatment did not differ significantly over time. The feasibility of the anxiety disorder guide was low compared to guided self-help. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that primary care patients with prevalent anxiety disorders for whom the primary care physician does not consider referral to be necessary can be treated appropriately by the primary care physician. Referral to a psychiatric outpatient clinic does not bring better results. Guided self-help is easier for the general practitioner to carry out than less structured treatment, as specified in the anxiety disorder guidelines.",0,0,

Purpose: To determine the benefits and harms of treatments for adults with ME/CFS and to identify future research needs. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Databases (January 1988 to September 2014), Clinical Trials Registers, Reference Lists and Manufacturer Information. Study selection: English-language randomized studies on the effectiveness and side effects of ME/CFS treatments. Data Extraction: Data on participants, study design, analysis, follow-up, and outcomes were extracted and validated. Study quality was assessed twice using predefined criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Data Synthesis: Among 35 Treatment Studies That Mainly Enrolled Participants In accordance with the 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Oxford CFS case definitions, the immunomodulator rintatolimod improved some measures of exercise performance compared to placebo in 2 studies (low weight): Studies with galantamine, hydrocortisone, IgG, valganciclovir, isoprinosine, fluoxetine and various complementary drugs have been inconclusive (insufficient evidence). ies and graded exercise therapy improved fatigue, function, general improvement, and work impairment compared to no treatment, relaxation, or support in some studies."" Counseling therapies also improved quality of life (low-to-moderate strength of evidence). Harms have rarely been reported across studies (insufficient evidence). Limitation: The studies were heterogeneous and limited by size, number, duration, applicability, and methodological quality. Conclusion: Studies of rintatolimod, counseling therapies, and graded exercise therapy suggest benefit for some patients who meet case definitions for CFS, while evidence for other treatments and harms is insufficient.

1917,Treatment services for children with ADHD: a national perspective,"AIM: To summarize knowledge about treatment services for children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), trends in services from 1989 to 1996, types of services provided, service mix, and barriers to service. METHOD: A literature review and analyzes from 2 national surveys of medical practices are presented. RESULTS: Major changes have occurred in stimulant prescriptions since 1989, with prescriptions now accounting for three quarters of all physician visits by children with ADHD. Between 1989 and 1996, related services such as health counseling for children with ADHD increased 10-fold and diagnostic services increased 3-fold. However, the provision of psychotherapy declined from 40% of pediatric visits to just 25% over the same period. Follow-up visits also dropped from more than 90% of visits to just 75%. Primary care physicians were more likely than pediatricians or psychiatrists to prescribe stimulants and were less likely to use diagnostic services, offer psychological counseling, or recommend follow-up care. Approximately 50% of children with identified ADHD seen in the office are receiving treatment that meets American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry guidelines. Physicians reported significant barriers to providing services to these children, including shortages of pediatricians, barriers to insurance, and long waiting lists. CONCLUSIONS: The trends in treatment services and physician variations in service delivery indicate large gaps between the research base and clinical practice. Clinical variability may reflect educational differences, disparities in specialist availability and duty locations, and changes in health care incentives.",0,0,

Concern about the doctor-patient relationship was the only attitudinal variable that independently predicted giving advice, in this case negatively (beta = -.465, p < .001). Possession of DDR did not change GPs' views on whether intervention in smokers harms the doctor-patient relationship, but weakened the relationship between this attitudinal element and the number of patients recommended to quit smoking (beta = 0.595, p<0.001 for interaction). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that concern about the doctor-patient relationship was an independent predictor of counseling, while in other studies it was only mentioned as something about which primary care physicians express concern. A simple device designed to trigger action by GPs appeared to work by mitigating the negative effects of an attitudinal barrier to action. It would be interesting to examine this phenomenon more generally in relation to health promotion activities by health professionals. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Recommendations that GPs engage in health promotion activities with their patients need to take into account that GP concerns about damaging the doctor-patient relationship may discourage such interventions. DDR appears to be effective in getting GPs to advise their smoking patients to quit smoking, and its widespread dissemination to GPs should be considered.",0,0,
1920,Tumor boards: optimizing the structure and improving the efficiency of the multidisciplinary management of cancer patients worldwide,"Multidisciplinary management tumor boards for the treatment of cancer patients are now being conducted worldwide. Studies evaluating their impact on decision making and patient outcome are limited"";"" However, single-center studies have reported significant changes in diagnostic and treatment plans. A survey from Arab countries showed that tumor boards are widespread and rely on tumor boards for decision-making. A recent multi-agency survey of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals in the United States found a limited association between the presence of tumor boards and care and outcomes. The Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium examined the relationship between tumor board functions and quality of care measures. Overall survival results among patients from these tumor board participating physicians are ongoing, but preliminary results are outlined in this article along with a recent ASCO survey of international members on the presence, use, and impact of tumor boards. Tumor boards enable the implementation of clinical practice guidelines and can help collect cases for clinical trials. Efforts to improve the preparation, structure, and conduct of tumor boards, research methods to monitor their performance, teamwork, and outcomes are also outlined in this article. The concept of mini tumor boards and more efficient methods for MDM in countries with limited resources will also be discussed. In sub-optimal settings such as small community hospitals, rural areas and areas with limited resources, tumor boards, particularly through the use of video conferencing facilities, can overcome or at least improve diagnostic and management limitations. Studies from the UK showed that specialized training of multidisciplinary teams (MDT) resulted in better team dynamics and communication, improved patient satisfaction and improved clinical outcome. This article also examines the weighting of benefits versus time and effort to improve efficiency, patient care, and better time management in the United States and in the international oncology community.",0,0,
1921,Putting knowledge into action at the point of care: The collective experience of caregivers facilitates the implementation of evidence-based practices,"BACKGROUND: Facilitation is viewed as a way of enabling clinicians to put evidence into practice by solving problems and providing support. Practice development is a well-established movement in the UK that involves the use of facilitators, but in Canada the role is more obtuse. Few studies have observed the process of facilitation as described by those experienced in implementing guidelines in North America. OBJECTIVE: To describe the tacit knowledge about facilitation embedded in the experiences of nurses putting evidence into practice. METHODS: Twenty nurses from across Canada were specifically selected to participate in an interactive knowledge translation symposium to examine what has and has not worked in translating evidence into practice. This study is an additional in-depth analysis of the data collected at the symposium, focusing on moderation as an intervention to improve evidence uptake. Critical Incident Technique was used to collect examples to examine nurses' experiences of facilitation. The participants exchanged their experiences and carried out initial data analysis and coding together. The data were further thematically analyzed using the qualitative inductive approach of constant comparison. RESULTS: A number of factors emerged at various levels that are related to the successes and failures of participants' efforts to facilitate evidence-based practice. Successful implementation in terms of: (a) focus on a priority issue, (b) relevant evidence, (c) development of strategic partnerships, (d) use of multiple strategies to effect change, and (e) facilitator characteristics and approach. Negative factors affecting the process were: (a) poor engagement or ownership, (b) resource deficiencies, (c) conflict, (d) context issues, and (e) lack of evaluation and sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Factors at the individual, environmental, organizational, and cultural levels affect the facilitation of evidence-based practice in real-life situations at the point-of-care. With a better understanding of the factors that contribute to successful or unsuccessful facilitation, future research should focus on analyzing facilitation interventions that are tailored to remove barriers and improve evidence-gathering facilitators.",0,0,

1925,Understanding and preventing criminal recidivism in adults with psychotic disorders,"The high prevalence of adults with psychotic disorders in the criminal justice system has received much attention recently, but our understanding of this issue is shaped by differing opinions. Mental health professionals point to deinstitutionalization and our fragmented mental health system as key causes. Criminologists downplay the role of mental illness, claiming that people with and without mental illness are arrested for the same reasons. Meanwhile, practice guidelines offer clinicians little guidance on how to address the problem. Drawing on current crime prevention principles and knowledge of psychotic disorders and their treatment, this article provides a conceptual framework for understanding and preventing relapse. The framework highlights the importance of individual and service-related risk variables and emphasizes the central role of treatment non-compliance as a mediator between modifiable risk variables and relapse. Based on the conceptual framework described in this article, three necessary intervention elements for relapse prevention in adults with psychotic disorders are presented: competent care, access to services, and legal influence. Research is needed to further define and test these intervention elements as a basis for future service delivery efforts.",0,0,

1927,Understanding the diagnosis and management of dementia and guideline implementation in general practice: a qualitative study using the theoretical domain framework,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a growing problem that places a significant burden on patients, their families and society. General practitioners (GPs) play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of dementia, but there are gaps between recommended and current practice. The aim of this study was to examine the reported practice of GPs in the diagnosis and treatment of dementia and to theoretically describe terms that proposed explanations for the practice that were consistent with evidence-based guidelines and not. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs in Victoria , Australia, conducted The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) guided data collection and analysis on factors hindering and enabling the achievement of 13 recommended behaviors. The data were analyzed based on content and thematic analyses. This paper provides an in-depth description of the factors influencing two behaviors, assessing comorbid depression using a validated instrument, and conducting a formal cognitive assessment. RESULTS: A total of 30 primary care physicians were surveyed, most primary care physicians reported not doing the assessment comorbid depression using a validated tool according to recommended guidelines. Obstacles included the belief that depression can be adequately assessed using general clinical indicators and that validated instruments provide little additional information (beliefs about outcome theory); discomfort in using validated tools ('emotion'), possibly due to limited training and confidence ('skills'; 'beliefs about skills'); limited awareness of the need for a depression assessment (“knowledge”; “memory, attention, and decision-making processes”) and forgetting to do it. Most reported practicing in a manner consistent with the recommendation that formal cognitive assessment be conducted using a validated scale. Key factors that made this possible were awareness of the need to undertake cognitive assessment (""knowledge""); Possession of the necessary skills and confidence (“skills”; “beliefs about skills”);” and sufficient time and resources (“environmental context and resources”). CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first study to use a theoretical approach to examine the barriers and prerequisites to guideline-recommended diagnosis and management of dementia in general practice. Key factors were identified that likely explain the acceptance of the guidelines by general practitioners. Findings have influenced the design of an intervention aimed at supporting practice switching in line with dementia guidelines, which is currently being evaluated in a cluster-randomized study.",0,0,
1928,Understanding How Physician Assessment Works: A Realistic Review Protocol,"INTRODUCTION: Physicians in the UK must now participate in revalidation to retain their license to practice medicine. The assessment is a fundamental part of revalidation. However, there is limited objective evidence that assessment changes physician behavior and directly translates to improved patient care. In particular, it is not clear how the assessment process is intended to change physician behavior and improve clinical performance. The aim of this research is to understand how and why the assessment of physicians should have an effect. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Realist Review is a theory-driven interpretative approach to evidence synthesis. It applies realistic investigative logic to produce an explanatory analysis of an intervention, ie what works, for whom, under what circumstances and in what respects. Using a realistic review approach, an initial program theory of assessment is developed by consulting key stakeholders in assessing physicians on expert panels (ethical approval is not required) and by searching the literature to identify relevant existing theories. The search strategy consists of a number of phases including a combination of: (1) searches of electronic databases, e.g. (4) contacting authors; and (5) searching gray literature. The evidence search will be iteratively expanded and refocused as the review progresses. Studies are included based on their ability to provide data that allow verification of the program theory. For example, data extraction is performed through notes and annotations at various stages of review, as per the realistic approach. The evidence is synthesized using realistic logic to challenge the final program theory of the impact of assessment on physician performance. Synthesis results will be written according to RAMESES guidelines and disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations.

1929,Understanding the implementation processes of clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines in pediatric contexts: a study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Canada is among the wealthiest nations in the world, yet the health and well-being of Canadian children is surprisingly poor. There is some evidence that these poor health outcomes are partly due to differences in clinical practice, which may result from a failure to apply the best available research in clinical practice, also known as knowledge translation (KT). Surprisingly, deviations are ubiquitous in clinical practice, even with common acute pediatric conditions. Deviations in clinical practice result in unnecessary medical treatments, increased suffering, and increased healthcare costs. This study focuses on improving health outcomes for common acute health problems in children by evaluating strategies that improve KT and reduce variation in clinical practice. DESIGN/METHODS: Using a multiple case study design, qualitative and quantitative data are collected from four emergency departments in western Canada. Data sources include: pre- and post-implementation focus group data from multidisciplinary healthcare professionals; individual interviews with the local champions, KT intervention providers and department/site heads/managers; Alberta Context Tool (ACT) survey data” and aggregated patient outcome data. Qualitative and quantitative data are systematically triangulated and matrices are created for cross-case comparisons. Based on the cross-case comparisons, statements about the success or failure of the clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and the inclusion of clinical pathways (CPs) are produced. SIGNIFICANCE: This study will generate new insights into the potential causal mechanisms and factors shaping implementation. Future studies will track the impact of implementing the CPG/CPs on children's health and healthcare costs.",0,0,
1930,Understanding colorectal cancer screening non-compliance: a case-control study embedded in a randomized trial,"Background The greatest limit to the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening is often low compliance. We examined the reasons for non-compliance and determinants of compliance with fecal occult blood testing in Lazio, Italy. Methods This is a case-control study embedded in a study that tested the effect of test type and provider on colorectal cancer screening adherence. Non-compliant subjects were classified as cases and compliant subjects were classified as controls. We studied 600 cases and 600 controls who were matched by their GP, half invited to the hospital for screening and the other half directly to their GP's office. Cases and controls answered questions about: distance from the test provider, logistical issues, perception of colorectal cancer risk, confidence in the effectiveness of screening, fear of results, family history of colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Results Approximately 31% of the cases never received the letter offering free screening, and 17% of the sample population had already been screened. The first reported reason for non-compliance was “lack of time” (30%)”;” The most important determinant of compliance was distance from the testing provider: odds ratio > 30 minutes vs. < 15 minutes 0.3 (95% CI = 0, 2-0.7). The odds ratio for lack of time was 0.16 (95% IC 0.1-0.26). The effect was stronger when the hospital (0.03 95% CI = 0.01-0.1) and not the general practitioner (0.3 95% CI = 0.2-0.6) was the provider. Twenty-two percent of the controls were accompanied by someone to the test. Conclusion To increase compliance, screening programs must involve testing providers who are geographically close to the target population.",0,1,

Two sets of data were collected through telephone interviews in June and October 2003. The doctors surveyed perceived the mobile system positively and began to use it frequently in their work. They reported few negative experiences using a Nokia Communicator. They favored the use of mobile technology as a way to better disseminate medical knowledge. The main contents of the system, the Evidence-Based Medical Guidelines and the Pharmaca Fennica (the Pharmacopoeia), were crucial for the use of the system. Some differences in physician behavior over time were also noted. Implications for system improvements are discussed.",0,0,
1932,Understanding practice: the factors influencing management of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department - a qualitative study using the Theoretical Domains Framework,"BACKGROUND: Mild traumatic brain injury is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. Despite the availability of clinical practice guidelines in this area, there are differences in practice. One of the goals of the Neurotrauma Evidence Translation program is to develop and evaluate a targeted, theory- and evidence-based intervention to improve the management of mild traumatic brain injury in Australian emergency departments. This study is the first step in the intervention development process and uses the Theoretical Domains Framework to examine the factors perceived to influence the adoption of four key evidence-based recommended practices for treating mild traumatic brain injury. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with rescue workers in the Australian state of Victoria. The interview guide was developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework to examine current practice and identify the factors affecting practice. Two researchers coded the interview transcripts using a thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 42 participants (9 directors, 20 physicians, and 13 nurses) were interviewed over a seven-month period. The results suggest that (i) the prospective assessment of post-traumatic amnesia was influenced by: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, skills, social/professional role and identity, and beliefs about skills; (ii) the use of Criteria or decision-making rules developed in guidelines for informing about the appropriate use of a CT scan was influenced by: knowledge; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision-making processes; beliefs about abilities; social influences; skills and behavioral regulation; (iii) the Provision of oral and written patient information at discharge was influenced by: beliefs about outcomes; environmental context and resources; memory, attention, and decision-making processes; social/professional role and identity; and knowledge; (iv) the practice of informing became routine Discharge follow-up influenced by: environmental context and resources, social/professional role and identity, knowledge edge; beliefs about consequences;"" and motivation and goals. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, factors thought to influence the treatment of mild traumatic brain injury in the emergency department were identified. These factors provide theoretically sound targets for future intervention represent.",0,0,
1933,"Understanding the neurobiology, assessment and treatment of substances of abuse and dependence: a guide for the critical care worker","What do I do as an intensive care nurse? Because of their training in health promotion, and also because they interact with patients, families and communities, nurses have first-hand opportunities to play an active role in the practice of primary prevention. To prevent the first occurrence of substance abuse, assess community needs, facility needs, and identify potential risks. Identify the extent of the problem. Intervene early in young people and risk groups. Refer patients and their families to mental health specialists. Educate patients, families and communities. To reduce the incidence of substance abuse, practicing secondary prevention requires immediate action at the earliest moments of recognition of a problem and directing patients to early intervention and rehabilitation. Screening your patients, providing brief education, and prompt referral constitute early intervention. To delay disease progression, practice tertiary prevention by providing the affected individual with education, counseling, and support in achieving and maintaining sobriety through medication and offer rehabilitative group and counseling work. The goal of intervention in the lives of drug addicts is to stop drug use, prevent relapse, and aid in recovery. After years of research, NIDA has identified 13 core principles for effective drug abuse treatment. 1. Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior. 2. No single treatment is right for everyone. 3. The treatment must be readily available. 4. Effective treatment addresses the diverse needs of the individual, not just his or her substance abuse needs. 5. Remaining in treatment for an appropriate length of time is essential. 6. Counseling - individual and/or group counseling - and other behavioral therapies are the most commonly used forms of substance abuse treatment. 7. Medication is an important element of treatment for many patients, particularly when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. 8. An individual's treatment and benefit plan must be continually evaluated and adjusted as necessary to ensure that it meets their changing needs. 9. Many drug addicts also have other mental disorders that require treatment. 10. Medically assisted detoxification in the first stage of addiction treatment alone does little to change long-term substance abuse. 11. Treatment does not have to be voluntary to be effective. 12. Drug use during treatment needs to be monitored continuously, as there are interruptions during treatment. 13. Treatment programs should screen patients for the presence of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases, and provide targeted risk reduction counseling to help patients change or modify behaviors that put them at risk of infection or spread of infectious diseases. To really impact this disease, there is a need to improve risk factor identification and early detection and intervention in children and adolescents. The future of neuroscience lies in objective brain scans and genetic testing. From these approaches, more objective measures of addiction and dependency can emerge using brain scans and genetic testing. These actions would potentially enable the development of vaccines against certain drugs of abuse and addiction, as well as increasingly selective and effective pharmacological treatment approaches, and a new consensus on standard treatments for substance addiction.",0,0,
1934,Understanding the performance of community health care volunteers involved in the delivery of health programs in underserved areas: a realistic synthesis,"Background Recruitment of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) to support the delivery of health programs is a well-established approach in underserved areas and particularly where health inequalities exist due to a lack of trained staff. However, there is a lack of evidence on what works to improve the performance of CHVs. This review aimed to summarize the existing literature to explain why, how, and under what circumstances intervention approaches to improve CHV performance are more likely to be successful. Methods We performed a realistic synthesis. We identified possible theories related to our review questions, which then guided the selection, assessment, and analysis of primary studies. Interesting publications from the years 2008 to 2012 were identified by a systematic search in the PubMed and IDEAS databases. We considered all study designs that examined the different aspects of CHV performance in the context of formal organizational settings as appropriate and excluded the studies that did not provide explanations for CHV performance either in the results or in the discussion section. The data were organized according to their relation to context, interventions, outcomes and mechanisms to identify the interaction between them. The synthesis of the data allowed us to determine explanatory patterns within or between studies. Findings We identified broad approaches to intervention within the 23 papers included in the review: positioning the CHV within the community, establishing clear roles, providing competency-based and continuous training, incentives, supervision, and logistical support for task distribution and implementation. The results shed light on which mechanisms (self-esteem, sense of duty, self-efficacy, feeling of being treated fairly) should be targeted when implementing such approaches, and which contextual factors (stable and supportive cultural, political and social context and closely connected intervention). with local health services) create the most favorable conditions for the occurrence of these mechanisms and ultimately contribute to better performance of CHVs. Four main explanatory patterns around these mechanisms have emerged as fundamental to better performance. Conclusions The patterns identified, combined with the designers' and other stakeholders' assumptions about how such interventions are intended to work, can be tested through empirical studies to provide useful information that can be used by program implementers, policymakers, donors, and the community.",0,0,
1935,"Unemployment and Mortality in Denmark, 1970-80","Relative mortality in the period 1970-80 was examined among Danish men and women who were unemployed and employed on the 1970 census day. The study population consisted of the entire labor force aged 20 to 64 on November 9, 1970, ie approximately 2 million employed and 22,000 unemployed. Relative mortality was analyzed using a multiplicative hazards regression model (as a natural extension of the standardized mortality rate) and a multiplicative regression model with extra Poisson variation. A significantly increased mortality rate (40-50%) was found among the unemployed after adjusting for occupation, housing category, geographic region and marital status. Analysis of the five main causes of death showed increased mortality from all causes, but particularly from suicide or accidents. In areas where the local unemployment rate was comparatively high, the relative mortality among the unemployed was lower. The increased mortality among the unemployed was interpreted as a consequence of health-related selection and as an increased susceptibility to psychosocial stress caused by unemployment.",0,0,
1936,Unequal protection of patients' rights: the gap between university and health ethics committees,"Despite the Cartwright Report's recommendations, ethical scrutiny by health ethics committees in New Zealand has continued without health practitioners ever having to acknowledge their dual role as health practitioners researching their own patients. On the other hand, universities explicitly identify doctor-researcher-patient relationships as potential role conflicts. This stems from the recognition within the higher education sector itself that faculty-researcher-student relationships are fraught with such conflicts. Although similar unequal relationships exist between health researchers and their patients, patients/subjects are not afforded the level of protection afforded to students/subjects. In this paper, we argue that the difference between universities and health research is the result of the Operational Standard Code for Ethics Committees' failure to explicitly recognize patient vulnerability and conflicts of interest in the dual role of health practitioner/researcher. We conclude the paper recommending that the Department of Health consider rewriting the Ethics Committee Code of Operations, specifically rewriting Section 26 of the Ethics Committee Code of Operations. We also identify the value of a comparative ethical review and propose the New Zealand Health Research Council's trilateral relationship with Australia's NHMRC (National Health and Medical Research Council) and Canada's CIHR (Canadian Institute of Health Research) as a useful starting point for such a process .",0,0,
1937,Unhealthy drinking habits and receipt of preventive medical services by older adults,"BACKGROUND: The use of preventive services among older adults is suboptimal. Unhealthy drinking can be a risk factor for not making use of these services. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between unhealthy drinking and utilization of recommended preventive services in older Medicare beneficiaries, using the framework of current alcohol use guidelines. DESIGN/METHODS: The data source is the nationally representative 2003 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The sample included 65 years and older (N = 10,523). Based on self-reported alcohol consumption, respondents were categorized as non-drinkers, within-guidelines drinkers, monthly but not daily limit drinkers, or heavy episodic drinkers. The influenza vaccination, the pneumonia vaccination, the glaucoma screening and the mammography entry were determined on the basis of survey and damage data. Bivariate and logistic regression analyzes were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 70.3% of women received influenza vaccination and 49% glaucoma screening, 66.8% pneumonia vaccination, and 56.2% of women received mammography over 2 years over the year. In logistic regression, heavy episodic drinking was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving services compared to drinking within guidelines: influenza shot (OR 0.75, CI 0.59-0.96), glaucoma screening (OR 0, 74, CI 0.58-0.95) and vaccination against pneumonia (OR 0.75, CI 0.59-0.96). Non-drinkers were less likely to receive a mammogram (OR 0.83, CI 0.69-1.00) compared to those who reported drinking within guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Heavy episodic drinking is associated with a lower likelihood of utilizing multiple preventive services. Practitioners should be encouraged to screen all elders for alcohol use and, in addition to appropriate intervention, consider that elders who report heavy episodic alcohol use are at greater risk of not receiving preventive services.",0,0,
1938,Unintended effects of a computerized physician order entry near-continuous alert to prevent drug-drug interaction: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background The effectiveness of computerized medical order entry (CPOE) systems has been modest, primarily because clinicians frequently override electronic alarms. Methods To evaluate the effectiveness of a near-hard-stop CPOE prescription alert aimed at reducing concomitant prescriptions of warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group, which received a near-hard stop alert, or a control group, which received standard practice. The study period was from August 9, 2006 to February 13, 2007. Results The proportion of desired responses (i.e. no reordering of the alarm-triggering drug within 10 minutes of initiation) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alarms) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.12; 95% confidence interval 0.045-0.33). However, the study was terminated early due to 4 unintended consequences identified in patients in the intervention group: a delay in treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 2 patients and a delay in treatment with warfarin in an additional 2 patients. Conclusions An electronic emergency stop alarm as part of an inpatient CPOE system appeared to be extremely effective in changing prescriptions. The intervention resulted in clinically meaningful treatment delays in 4 patients requiring immediate medical therapy. These results illustrate the importance of formal assessment and monitoring for unintended consequences of the Programmatic interventions to improve prescribing habits.",0,1,
1939,Update on interventions that focus on symptom clusters: what has been tried and what have we learned?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although clinicians and researchers recognize clusters of symptoms, the focus was on alleviating a single symptom. This review summarizes the current literature on interventions focused on alleviating symptom clusters in cancer patients. RECENT RESULTS: Twelve intervention studies that met the inclusion criteria were published in 2011-2012. The time frame was extended to 2009-2012 and 24 studies met the criteria: 18 in early-stage and 6 in advanced-stage cancer patients. Several cognitive behavioral therapies, complementary therapies, and exercise interventions have shown positive results in alleviating a variety of symptom clusters in multiple cancers. Most psychoeducational interventions, using traditional formats or those combined with automated clinical alerts, showed efficacy in reducing a wide variety of clusters. Clusters that included fatigue and anxiety or depression were reduced by exercise in early-stage patients and by methylphenidate in advanced-stage patients. Recent studies funded by the NIH R01 confirmed the trends in the types of interventions tested. SUMMARY: Few interventions have been tested and found effective to alleviate specific symptom clusters in early- and advanced-stage cancer patients. Future research must expand our understanding of the mechanisms that trigger co-occurring symptoms. Mechanism-directed interventions need to be identified and tested in homogeneous samples with specific symptom clusters. Interventions must be repeated before policies can be established.",0,0,
1940,Update on pediatric hyperlipidemia,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to review the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHBLI) guidelines for the screening and management of hyperlipidemia in children and to discuss critics' concerns about universal screening. RECENT RESULTS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey showed favorable trends in serum lipid levels in children and adolescents aged 6-19 years between 1988-1994 and 2007-2010. Mean total cholesterol (TC) decreased from 165 to 160 mg/dL and the prevalence of elevated TC decreased from 11.3 to 8.1%. However, between 2007 and 2010, about 20% of children ages 9 to 11 had either low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or high non-HDL-C. This warrants an additional assessment under NHBLI guidelines. SUMMARY: The NHBLI guidelines provide physicians with a balanced perspective for the screening and management of hyperlipidemia in children. These guidelines provide a schematic approach to help GPs make treatment decisions. The hope is that this will lead to reduced healthcare system spending and overall improved health through early detection and intervention.",0,0,
1941,"Medical researchers in the United States, the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial and the Nuremberg Code. A review of the results of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments","The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experimentation (ACHRE), established to review allegations of abuse of human subjects in government-sponsored radiation research, was tasked with identifying appropriate standards for assessing the ethics of Cold War radiation experimentation. A key question for ACHRE was to determine the role of the Nuremberg Code in the norms and practices of US medical research. Based on evidence from ACHRE's Ethics Oral History Project and extensive archival research, we conclude that at the time of its promulgation, the Code had had little impact on established medical researchers studying humans. Although some clinical researchers raised questions about conducting research on humans, it was not until the 1960s that the medical profession began to pursue the issue.",0,0,
1942,Use and impact of health information sharing: a systematic review,"Background: Health information exchange (HIE) is increasing in the United States and is encouraged by government policies. Purpose: To systematically review and evaluate evidence for the use and effect of HIE on clinical care. Data Sources: Selected databases from January 1, 2003 to May 31, 2014. Study Selection: English-language hypothesis testing or quantitative studies of various types of data exchange between independent organizations for use in clinical care that addressed health outcomes, efficiency, utilization, cost, satisfaction, HIE usage, sustainability, and attitudes or barriers. Data extraction: Data extraction was performed twice. DATA SYNTHESIS: Low-quality evidence from 12 hypothesis-testing studies supports an effect of HIE use on reduced use or costs in the ED. Direct evidence of HIEs being used by providers was reported in 21 studies involving 13 different HIE organizations, 6 of which were based in New York, and generally showed use in less than 10% of patient encounters. Findings from 17 sustainability studies indicate that about a quarter of existing HIE organizations rate themselves as financially stable. Findings from 38 studies on attitudes and barriers showed that providers, patients, and other stakeholders see HIE as valuable, but barriers include technical issues and workflows, costs, and privacy concerns. Limitation: publication bias, possible selective reporting of results, and a lack of reporting of context and implementation processes. Conclusion: Leveraging health information sharing is likely to reduce emergency room utilization and costs in some cases. Effects on other endpoints are not known. All stakeholders claim to value HIE, but there are many barriers to adoption and sustainability. A small subset of operational HIEs has been evaluated and further research is needed to identify and understand success factors.",0,1,
1943,Using and Avoiding Isolation and Restraint: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project Beta Seclusion and Restrain Workgroup,"Issues related to reducing and/or eliminating episodes of isolation and restraint in patients with behavioral problems in crisis clinics, emergency departments, inpatient psychiatric departments, and specialized psychiatric emergency services continue to be an area of concern and discussion among mental health clinicians. An important guiding principle of the BETA (Best Practices in Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation) project is non-forced de-escalation as the intervention of choice in dealing with acute agitation and threatening behavior. In this article, the authors discuss various aspects of seclusion and restraint, including a review of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services policies governing its use in medical behavioral settings, adverse consequences of this intervention for patients and staff, and a review of quality improvement and risk management strategies, that have been effective in reducing their use in various treatment settings. An algorithm designed to help the clinician determine when solitude or restraint is most appropriate is introduced. The authors conclude that because of their primary treatment of acute patients, the specialized psychiatric emergency services and emergency departments may not be able to completely eliminate the use of isolation and restraint events, but these programs can employ strategies to reduce their utilization interventions.",0,0,

1945,Using a Clinical Decision Support Tool to Improve Guideline Adherence for the Treatment of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus: Skin and Soft Tissue Infections.,"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) with abscesses are commonly seen in the emergency room (ED). With the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-related abscesses, appropriate evidence-based decisions are essential for successful treatment. Provider adherence to clinical guidelines for the management of SSTIs with suspected MRSA remains inconsistent in terms of prescription practice related to antibiotic selection, wound culturing, and patient discharge recommendations related to the use of infection control techniques. There is evidence that the use of clinical decision support tools (CDS) is valuable to improve provider awareness and adherence to clinical guidelines. This study was conducted to investigate whether developing a CDS tool to guide order entry for the treatment of MRSA-related SSTIs and embedding it in the electronic medical record program would improve compliance with the North Carolina Consensus Guideline for Management of Suspected Community-Acquired MRSA -Skin and soft tissue.",0,1,
1946,Using a computer to recognize and respond to clinical events: its impact on clinical behavior.,"computer was used to prospectively identify and suggest responses to simple, medication-related events as reflected in a computerized recording in a prospective, randomized study of a primary care-responsible diabetes clinic. There were two categories of events/suggestions: If the last observation of a test required for medication control was too old, the computer suggested a repeat”; and when an abnormality with therapeutic implications was detected, the computer suggested a specific change in therapeutics. Clinicians responded to 36% of events in the first category with computer recall and 11% without (P<0.0001); they responded to 28% of events in the second category with computer assistance and 13% without (P<0.026). For the most clinically significant of these second category events, the difference was even greater: 47% with and 4% without computer assistance (p<0.0004). I believe that computer recognition and response (in the form of memories) to simple clinical events will change the behavior of physicians.",1,1,
1947,Use of a computerized guideline for glucose regulation in the ICU improved both guideline adherence and glucose regulation.,"Objective: To measure the effects of a computerized glucose regulation policy in an intensive care unit. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial with an off-on-off design. Methods: In the first phase of the study, we implemented a paper-based glucose regulation guideline in an intensive care unit. During the second period, the guideline was applied randomly in either paper or computerized form. In the third period, the guideline was only available in paper form. Measurements and results: We analyzed data from 484 patients. During the intervention period, the control group comprised 54 patients and the computer-assisted intervention group comprised 66 patients. The two guideline-related outcome measures consisted of compliance with: (a) the timing recommendations for glucose testing and (b) the insulin dose recommendation. We measured clinical effect as the percentage of time glucose levels fell within the target range. In the first (paper-based) phase of the study, 29.0% of the samples were optimally timed; during the second phase this rose to 35.5% for paper-based and 40.2% for computer-based protocols. Punctuality scores in the third study period returned. Late (suboptimal) sampling occurred in 66% of glucose measurements in the first study period, 42% of the paper-based and 28% of the computer-based protocol samples in the second period, and 50.0% samples in the third study period. In the first study period, adherence to insulin dosing guidelines was 56.3%; in the second period it was 64.2% for paper-based and 77.3% for computer-based protocols, and in the third period it fell to 42.4% For the second study period, the time it took for a patient's glucose levels to fall within the target range improved for both the control group (52.9%) and the computer-assisted group (54.2%) compared to the first study period (44 .3%) and the third study period (42.3%) Conclusion: Implementation of a computer-based version of a guideline significantly improved the timeliness of measurements and glucose regulation in critically ill patients compared to implementation of a paper-based version of the guideline.",1,1,
1948,Using a decision aid with overdetection information to support an informed breast cancer screening decision: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background Mammography screening may reduce breast cancer mortality. However, most women are unaware that trivial diseases can also be detected through screening, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Our aim was to investigate whether including information about overdetection of breast cancer in a decision aid would help women around the age of 50 make an informed decision about breast screening. Methods We conducted a community-based, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study in New South Wales, Australia, with a randomized cohort of women aged 48-50 years. The study was recruited by telephone”; Women were eligible if they had not had a mammogram in the past 2 years and had no personal or strong family history of breast cancer. Using a computer program, we randomly assigned 879 participants to either the intervention decision aid (consisting of evidence-based explanatory and quantitative information on overdetection, breast cancer mortality reduction, and false positives) or a control decision aid (including information on breast cancer mortality reduction and false alarms) Participants and interviewers were masked to the group. The primary endpoint was informed choice (defined as adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening intentions), which we assessed via telephone interview approximately 3 weeks after random assignment. The primary endpoint was assessed in all Women analyzed who had completed the relevant follow-up Interview questions in full This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12613001035718. Results Between January 2014 and July 2014, 440 women were assigned to the intervention group and 439 to the control group. 21 women in the intervention group and 20 controls were lost to follow-up; another 10 women assigned to the intervention and 11 controls did not answer all questions about attitudes. Therefore, 409 women in the intervention group and 408 controls were analyzed for the primary endpoint. 99 (24%) of 409 women in the intervention group made an informed choice compared to 63 (15%) of 408 in the control group (difference 9%, 95% CI 3-14; p=0·0017). Compared to the controls, more women in the intervention group reached the threshold for adequate overall knowledge (122/419 [29%] vs. 71/419 [17%]; difference 12%, 95% CI 6-18; p<0 0001 ), fewer women expressed a positive attitude towards screening (282/409 [69%] vs. 340/408 [83%]; 14%, 9–20; p<0 0001), and fewer women intended to be screened ( 308/419 [74%] vs. 363/419 [87%]; 13%, 8-19; p<0·0001). When only conceptual knowledge was considered, 203 (50%) of 409 women in the intervention group made an informed decision compared to 79 (19%) of 408 in the control group (p < 0 0001) Interpreting information to overdetect breast cancer in a decision aid increased the number of women who consciously chose to have breast screening Being better informed could make women less likely to choose screening.",0,1,
1949,Application of a fall prevention practice guideline for at-risk older people in community accommodation: a feasibility study,"BACKGROUND: Falls are common in older people and are a common cause of physical and psychological morbidity and health service utilization. The problem can be traced back to a complex interaction between health, behavioral and environmental factors. In order to ensure a uniform and evidence-based approach, a practical guide to fall prevention for elderly people at risk of falling at home was developed. AIM: To test the feasibility of integrating a practice guideline on falls prevention into the daily practice of 4 primary health care disciplines, ie general practitioners, nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists. METHODS: This was a descriptive study conducted by 10 local health networks across Flanders. The subjects involved in the study were 99 domestic workers and 1,142 elderly patients (65 years or older) who could get up from a chair and move around independently. For 6 months, primary care workers implemented our fall prevention guideline, which consisted of 3 parts (case finding, multifactorial in-depth assessment, and interventions). After the 6-month trial period, the participating primary care physicians were asked to complete a semi-structured questionnaire to assess the guideline's applicability in daily practice. RESULTS: The average time required to complete the guideline was 32.0 +/- 14.0 min. Health care workers of all 4 disciplines considered case finding their task. The situation was different when assessing risk factors and interventions. Although 87.5% considered fall prevention to be an important issue, health professionals across disciplines disagreed on how to integrate the prevention guideline into daily practice. A lack of time (57.3%), low motivation of the target population (53.3%) and insufficient cooperation between healthcare workers (37.3%) were perceived as barriers to the implementation of the guideline. CONCLUSION: The integration of prevention strategies into daily practice can be initiated with the help of a guide. Case finding can be carried out for all disciplines. Multifactorial assessment and interventions require specific task allocation, multidisciplinary collaboration, and clear communication.",0,0,
1950,Using action planning to improve the delivery of smoking cessation treatment by general practitioners: role of specificity and implementation of the plan,"Background Strategies are needed to help general practitioners (GPs) promote smoking cessation, as recommended in the guidelines. This study examines whether the quality of primary care physicians' action planning improves their delivery of smoking cessation treatment. Methods The effectiveness of a 1-hour exercise program was evaluated in a cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 49 general practitioners. General practitioners who participated in the training (intervention group"";"" n?=?25) formulated action plans in relation to i) questions about smoking, ii) advice on smoking cessation and iii) organization of follow-up care for smokers motivated to quit. GPs also formulated a coping plan for encountering smokers who were not motivated to quit. The quality of these plans (plan specificity) was assessed and GPs reported on the execution of these plans (plan implementation) 6 weeks after the training. The effects of plan specificity and plan implementation on the patient-reported smoking cessation activities of primary care physicians in the intervention group (n?=?1,632 patients) compared to the control group (n?=?1,769 patients) were examined using multilevel regression analyses. . Results Compared to the control group, primary care physicians who formulated a very specific action plan during the training asked their patients about smoking more often after the training than before the training (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.51-2.95). GPs were the most likely to ask patients about smoking after the training compared to before the training, when they had adopted a very specifically formulated action plan (OR 3.08, 95% CI 2.04-4.64). The impact of the specificity of the GP plan and the implementation of the plan on patients' questioning about smoking was most evident among GPs who intended to provide smoking cessation treatment at baseline. Conclusions A highly specific action plan formulated by a GP on when, how and by whom patients will be interviewed about smoking had a positive effect on GP surveys about smoking, particularly when these professionals reported implementing the plan. This effect was most evident in primary care physicians who intended to provide smoking cessation treatment prior to the intervention. Training on how to create personalized coping plans is recommended to further improve the way GPs offer smoking cessation services and organize smoking cessation follow-up care.",1,1,
1951,Using an internet portal to improve community-based pediatric ADHD care: a randomized cluster study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a quality improvement program to improve pediatrician adherence to existing, evidence-based guidelines for treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Forty-nine pediatricians in 8 practices participated in a cluster-randomized study. The practices were grouped according to the number of pediatricians and the proportion of patients receiving Medicaid. Medical histories for a random sample of patients with ADHD for each of the participating pediatricians were examined at baseline and at 6 months. All practices participated in 4 training sessions including didactic lectures and workshops on changing office flow. The practices were then given access to an ADHD web portal that allowed parents, teachers, and pediatricians to enter information (e.g., rating scales) about patients, after which the information was assessed, interpreted, and formatted in a reporting style helpful for the assessment was and treatment of patients with ADHD. Physicians evaluated their practice behavior quarterly and addressed underperforming areas. RESULTS: Pediatricians in the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher rates of many ADHD care practices recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, including surveys of parents (Cohen's d = 0.69) and teachers (i.e = 0.68) Rating Scales for Assessing Children with ADHD, Using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Criteria (d = 0.85), and Using Teacher Rating Scales to Monitor Treatment Success (d = 1.01) . CONCLUSION: A quality improvement intervention that can be widely disseminated through the use of Internet-based information technology has significantly improved the quality of ADHD care in community-based pediatric settings.",0,0,

1954,Use of warfarin at discharge in acute ischemic stroke patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation for patients with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation, and previous studies have shown that anticoagulation is underused in these patients in China. We have attempted to examine the underlying reasons and factors currently affecting warfarin use in China. Methods: From June 2012 to January 2013, 19,604 patients with acute ischemic stroke were enrolled in 219 city hospitals who voluntarily participated in the China National Stroke Registry II. Multivariable logistic regression models using the generalized estimating equation method were used to identify patient/hospital factors independently associated with warfarin use at discharge. RESULTS: Of the 952 acute ischemic stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, 19.4% were discharged on warfarin. The risk of bleeding (52.8%) and patient refusal (31.9%) were the main reasons for not prescribing anticoagulation. Larger/teaching hospitals were more likely to prescribe warfarin. Older patients, heavy drinkers, and patients with a higher National Institutes of Health stroke score at admission were less likely to receive warfarin, while patients with a history of heart failure and an internationally normalized ratio of between 2.0 and 3.0 during hospitalization were significantly associated with warfarin use at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The use of warfarin in patients with ischemic stroke and known non-valvular atrial fibrillation in China remains low. Hospital size and academic status along with patient age, heart failure, heavy alcohol consumption, internationally normalized hospital ratio, and stroke severity at admission were each independently associated with warfarin use at discharge. There is much room for improvement in secondary stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in China.",0,0,
1955,"User satisfaction and frustration with a portable, pen-based system for implementing asthma guidelines","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate physician satisfaction and frustration with the use of a handheld computer system implementing a policy for the management of childhood asthma exacerbations. SETTING: Nine pediatric primary care practices. DESIGN: Survey component of a randomized, prospective before-after study. INTERVENTION: Newton MessagePad equipped with custom software (called “AsthMonitor”) that helps document clinical findings and provides guideline-based recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, 3 users gave strongly positive global ratings while 6 users were neutral. At the same time, the majority used the documentation functions with care. With the exception of the recommendations for administering oxygen (which were not supported by evidence), users found the recommendations appropriate and valued the memories. Seven out of nine participants felt that documentation took more time with AsthMonitor. CONCLUSIONS: Handheld computers are acceptable to some practitioners in practice for providing guideline-based advice in the context of the clinical encounter.",0,1,
1956,"Using ""nudge"" principles for order set design: a before-and-after evaluation of an e-prescribing template in critical care","Aim Computerized prescription sets have the potential to reduce clinical variability and improve patient safety, but the impact varies. We sought to assess the impact of prescription set design changes on the delivery of chlorhexidine mouthwash and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) to ICU patients. Methods The study was conducted at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, UK. Our intensive care unit uses a clinical information system (CIS). All medications and fluids are prescribed using the CIS, and medication and fluid charts are stored in a database. Chlorhexidine mouthwash was added to the prescription template as a default prescription in January 2010. HES was removed from the prescription template in April 2009. Both interventions could be manually prescribed throughout the study period. We performed a database review of all patients eligible for each intervention before and after changes to the choice configuration within the prescribing system. Results 2231 ventilated patients were identified as eligible for treatment with chlorhexidine, 591 before the intervention and 1640 afterwards. 55.3% were prescribed chlorhexidine before the switch and 90.4% afterwards (p<0.001). 6199 patients were included in the HES intervention, 2177 before the intervention and 4022 after. The mean HES volume infused per patient decreased after the change from 630 mL to 20 mL (p<0.001) and the percentage of patients receiving HES decreased from 54.1% to 3.1% (p<0.001). These results have been well maintained over time. Conclusions The presentation of choices within an e-prescribing system influenced the delivery of evidence-based interventions in a predictable manner, and the effect was sustained. This approach has the potential to improve the effectiveness of computerized job sets.",1,1,
1957,Using a taxonomy of behavior modification techniques to identify agents in studies implementing interventions for diabetes care,"BACKGROUND: Methodological guidelines for reporting on interventions emphasize the detailed description of intervention content. Despite this, systematic reviews of quality improvement (QI) interventions remain limited by a lack of clarity and detail regarding the intervention content to be assessed. Our aim was to apply the recently developed Behavior Change Techniques Taxonomy Version 1 (BCTTv1) to studies of implementation interventions for diabetes management to assess the capacity and usefulness of this taxonomy to characterize agents. METHODS: Three psychologists independently coded a random sample of 23 studies on health system, provider, and/or patient-centric implementation interventions from a systematic review that included 142 such studies. The intervention content was encoded using BCTTv1, which describes 93 behavior change techniques (BCTs) grouped into 16 categories. We have supplemented the generic coding instructions within the BCTTv1 with decision rules and examples from this literature. RESULTS: Less than a quarter of the possible BCTs within the BCTTv1 were identified. For implementation interventions aimed at providers, the most commonly identified BCTs included: adding objects to the environment, prompts/cues, instructions on how to perform the behavior, credible source, goal setting (outcome), feedback on behavior outcome, and social support ( practical). For implementation interventions that also target patients, the most commonly identified BCTs were: Prompts/cues, Instructions to perform the behavior, Information about health outcomes, Restructuring of the social environment, Adding objects to the environment, Social support (practical) , and goal setting (behaviour). BCTTv1 mapped well to implementation measures aimed directly at physicians and patients, and could also be used to study the impact of system-level interventions on physician and patient behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The BCTTv1 can be used to characterize the agents in intervention delivery studies and provides substantive specificity beyond what is indicated by broader intervention labels. Identifying BCTs may provide a more helpful means of gathering knowledge about the content used in attempts at implementation interventions, which may help better inform replication efforts. In addition, prospectively using a taxonomy of behavior change techniques to develop and report on intervention content would further help build a cumulative science of effective implementation interventions.",0,0,
1958,Using a planned behavioral framework theory to examine beliefs about hand hygiene in the '5 critical moments' among Australian hospital nurses,"BACKGROUND: Improving hand hygiene among healthcare workers (HCWs) is the single most effective intervention in reducing HAIs. Understanding the cognitive determinants of hand hygiene decisions for healthcare workers with the greatest patient contact (nurses) is critical to improving compliance. The aim of this study was to examine the beliefs of nurses in hospitals related to the implementation of hand hygiene according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 5 critical moments. Using the belief-based framework of Theory of Planned Behavior, we examined attitudinal, normative, and controlling beliefs that underpin caregiver decisions to perform hand hygiene according to recently introduced national guidelines. METHODS: Thematic content analysis of qualitative data from focus group discussions with nurses from 5 wards in 3 hospitals in Queensland, Australia. RESULTS: Key advantages (patient and self-protection), disadvantages (time, hand damage), facilitators (supportive: patients, colleagues""; unsupportive: some physicians), barriers (overload, emergency situations), and facilitators (sink/product accessibility, training). , memories) were identified. There was some ambiguity regarding the relative importance of hand washing after exposure to the patient environment. CONCLUSIONS: The belief base of the theory of planned behavior provided a useful framework to systematically assess the beliefs underlying nurses' hand hygiene decisions according to the 5 critical Moments to examine and allow for comparisons to previous persuasion studies A commitment to improving caregivers' hand hygiene practices in the 5 Moments should focus on individual strategies to combat distraction from other tasks, peer-based initiatives to promote a A sense of shared responsibility and management-driven solutions to address staffing and resource issues.

While many reports focus on the limitations and barriers, this paper proposes a new approach to “make EBP a reality”. Appreciative inquiry (AI), both a social research method and an organizational development or change intervention, is a novel means of evoking enthusiasm and support for EBP in nursing. Readers are introduced to the theoretical foundations and assumptions as well as the ""4-D model"" of AI. It is suggested that the Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) has a key role in introducing and supporting this intervention in healthcare organizations to promote the successful implementation of EBP.",0,0,
1960,Use of computer-assisted clinical decision support for screening for latent tuberculosis infection.,"Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines recommending that high-risk groups be screened for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The aim of this study was to determine the impact of computer-assisted clinical decision support and guided web-based documentation on screening rates for LTBI. Design Non-randomized, prospective intervention study. Setting and participants Participants were 8463 patients treated in two primary care ambulatory public health centers in late 2002 and early 2003. Intervention The CDC's LTBI guidelines were coded into a computer-assisted clinical decision support system that provided an alert message with recommendations for further assessment of LTBI risk when certain guideline criteria were met (birth in a high-risk TB country and age <40). A guided web-based documentation tool was provided to facilitate appropriate adherence to the LTBI screening guideline and to encourage accurate documentation and assessment. Baseline data was collected for 15 weeks and study phase data was collected for 12 weeks. Key Outcome Measures Adequate LTBI screening per CDC guidelines based on a table review. Results Of 4135 patients enrolled during the post-intervention period, 73% had at least one CDC-defined risk factor, and 610 met alert criteria (birth in a high-risk TB country and age <40 years) for potential screening for LTBI. Adherence to the LTBI screening guideline improved significantly from 8.9% at baseline to 25.2% during the study period (183% increase, p<0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrated that computer-assisted clinical decision support with alerts and guided web-based documentation improved the screening of high-risk patients for LTBI. This type of technology could lead to an improvement in LTBI screening in the United States and also promises improved care for other preventive and chronic diseases.",0,1,
1961,Use implementation intentions to teach practitioners: Change practice behavior through continuing education,"AIM: This study evaluated the effectiveness of implementation intentions to increase the use of an exercise behavior among psychiatrists who attended a one-day continuing education course. METHODS: Seventy-eight physicians were randomly assigned to one of two psychiatric advance directive classes. One class integrated instructions into implementation intentions (N=40) and the other class did not (N=38). The intent-to-execute training required participants to describe the best time and place to use a practitioner-led process to help consumers complete a psychiatric living will. Use of the practitioner-guided procedure was the dependent variable in this study. The use of the method in practice was evaluated three months after the lesson by means of an electronic self-assessment survey. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two classroom conditions in terms of participant characteristics or pre- and post-teaching knowledge of and intentions to use the procedure. 54 participants (69%) responded to the three-month follow-up survey and indicated that they had used the practitioner-led process. The results of the follow-up survey showed that the participants in the class with the intention to implement it used the practice-led approach significantly more often than those in the other class (80% versus 58%). The effect of implementation intentions on the use of the practitioner-led approach was evident among practitioners whose postclass intentions were high but below the median of the overall sample (chi(2)=7.1, df=1, p<.01). The implementation rates among the practitioners with the highest intentions after the class were equivalent in the two class states. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating implementation intentions into continuing education courses can increase the utilization of the practices taught in these courses among well-motivated practitioners.",1,1,

1963,Use of paper chart-based clinical reminders to improve adherence to lipid management guidelines,"Rationale, Aims, and Objectives: The aim of this study was to apply paper-based clinical reminder to improve adherence to lipid guidelines. METHODS: Coronary artery disease (CHD) patients not on lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) were recruited and medical records were reviewed. Eligible subjects were randomized"";"" In the study group but not in the control group, a clinical reminder was stamped on the paper record with current standards and local insurance policy. The primary endpoint was a new LLT subscription at the 6-month follow-up period and the secondary endpoint was the composite result of the LLT or lipid profile review. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were assigned to the study group and 102 to the control group. The primary endpoint showed no difference at the end of 6 months (OR: 1.70, P=0.248, 95% CI: 0.69-4.19). The secondary endpoint was significantly higher in the memory group (OR: 2.81, P=0.001, 95% CI: 1.57-5.04). CONCLUSION: A paper chart-based clinical reminder with updated clinical recommendations could change physician behavior and improve awareness of lipid levels. However, its effect cannot be translated into an increase in LLT or a decrease in low-density lipoprotein levels due to local political restrictions.",1,1,
1964,Using Pathology-Specific Laboratory Profiles in Clinical Pathology to Reduce Inappropriate Testing Requests: Two Completed Audit Cycles,"BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have shown that the Consensus Guidelines, although well prepared, have not changed clinical practice. In the health district of Castelnovo ne Monti (Reggio Emilia, Italy) it became necessary for general practitioners and clinical pathologists to work together to jointly define laboratory profiles. METHODS: Observational study of two cycles of retrospective review of test request forms in a primary care setting. The objectives of the study were to develop pathology-specific laboratory profiles and to increase the number of tentative diagnoses on laboratory test request forms. A multi-professional, multi-disciplinary, multi-hospital work team developed pathology-specific laboratory profiles for a more effective testing requirement. After 8 training sessions using a combined strategy with multiple interventions, the 23 General Practitioners (GPs) in the test district (Castelnovo ne Monti) tested the profiles”; the 21 GPs in the Puianello district were the control group; all GPs in both districts participated in the study All laboratory tests for both health districts are performed in the laboratory located in the study district Baseline examination and 1-year audit were performed in both districts using GP inquiry forms RESULTS: Seven pathology-specific laboratory profiles for outpatients were developed. In the year after the first audit cycle: 1) the number of tests requested in the study district was significantly lower than in the previous year, with a decrease of approximately 5% (p<0.001); 2) the preliminary diagnosis on the claim forms was 52.8% in the experimental district and 42% in the control district (p<0.001) 3) the decrease in the number of tests on each claim form was much more pronounced in the district (8.73 vs. 10, 77; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The first cycle of audits showed a significant decrease in the number of tests ordered in the trial area only. The combined strategy used in this study improved prescription compliance for most primary care physicians involved. The presence of the clinical pathologist is seen as an added value.",0,0,
1965,Use of second-generation antidepressants for the treatment of depressive disorders: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians,"Description: The American College of Physicians developed this guideline to review the available evidence for the pharmacological treatment of the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, subsyndromic depression, and associated symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, or neurovegetative symptoms, using Second-generation antidepressants Methods: Published literature on this topic was identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007-language studies in adults over 19 years of age. Keywords for the search included terms for depressive disorders and 12 specific second generation antidepressants bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone and venlafaxine and their specific trade names This policy classifies t The Evidence and recommendations are generated using the American College of Physicians Guidelines for Clinical Practice rating system. Recommendation 1: The American College of Physicians recommends that when considering pharmacological therapy to treat patients with acute major depressive disorder, physicians select second-generation antidepressants based on side effect profiles, cost, and patient preference (Grade: Strong Recommendation; moderate- proof of quality). Recommendation 2: The American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians regularly assess patient status, therapeutic response, and side effects of antidepressant therapy, beginning within 1 to 2 weeks of starting therapy (Grade: strong recommendation; evidence of moderate Quality). Recommendation 3: The American College of Physicians recommends that physicians adjust treatment if the patient does not show an adequate response to pharmacotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks of starting treatment for major depressive disorder (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Recommendation 4: The American College of Physicians recommends that physicians continue treatment for 4 to 9 months after a satisfactory response in patients with a first major depressive episode. For patients who have had 2 or more depressive episodes, an even longer duration of therapy may be beneficial (grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).",0,0,
1966,Using shared goal setting to improve access and equity: a mixed methods study of Good Goals intervention in child occupational therapy,"Background Access and equity in children's therapy services can be improved by directing the use of resources by clinicians toward specific goals that are important to patients. To achieve this, a practice change intervention (titled ¡Â®Good GoalsÂ¡Â¯) was developed. This study examined uptake, acceptance, and potential impact of this intervention in occupational therapy for children. Methods Mixed methods case studies (n?=?3 services including 46 therapists and 558 children) were conducted. The intervention was delivered over 25 weeks through personal training, team workbooks and 'tools for change'. Data were collected before, during, and after the intervention on a range of factors using interviews, a focus group, case note analysis, routine data, document analysis, and investigator observations. Outcomes Factors related to reception and adoption were: type of intervention delivery, competing demands for therapist time, and service provider leadership. Service providers and therapists reported that the intervention: Helped therapists find common rationale for clinical decisions Increased clarity in service delivery Improved interactions with families and schools Ratio 2.4 (95% CI 1, 5 to 3.8); Goal agreement, 3.5 (2.4 to 5.1);"" Assessment of progress, 2.0 (1.1 to 3.5). Children's LoT decreased by two months [95% CI ?8 to +4 ?months] across services.Costs per trained therapist ranged from Â¡Âª1,003 to Â£1,277, depending on service size and therapist salary range.Conclusions Good goals are a promising quality improvement measure that can be implemented and adopted in practice and Further research is needed to assess: (i) impact on patient outcomes, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and (ii) transferability to other clinical contexts.",0,1,
1967,Using standardized patients to measure physician professional performance,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the types of inaccuracies likely to arise when standardized patients (SPs) are used to measure physician behavior and to assess the potential impact of these inaccuracies on estimates of physician performance. DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General practitioner offices. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen subjects, each presenting one of two patient scenarios, made a total of 179 visits to 92 general practitioners participating in a separate randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of an educational workshop on implementation of prevention guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy of the SPs' presentation of the assigned scenarios and accuracy of their coding of physician performance, determined based on audiotapes of the visits and correlated with indicators of the physicians' preventive practices. RESULTS: The accuracy of patient scenario presentation was 84.8% for the male SPs and 93.5% for the female SPs. Inaccuracies in the presentation had no influence on the doctors' performance values. The accuracy of coding the medical service was 90.5% for the female SPs (kappa = 0.66) and 90.1% for the male SPs (kappa = 0.68). Coding errors occurred most frequently in the assessment of alcohol consumption and smoking recommendation. CONCLUSION: SPs can provide valid information about physicians' professional performance. However, standardization of their activities should not be taken for granted. It may be more difficult to obtain standardized coding for counseling activities, an aspect of physician visits for which SPs are particularly well suited.",0,0,
1968,Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to understand adherence to multiple evidence-based indicators in primary care: a qualitative study,"Background There are recognized gaps between evidence and practice in general practice, an environment that poses particular implementation challenges. We previously reviewed clinical guideline recommendations to derive a set of high-impact indicators based on criteria including potential for significant patient benefit, scope for improved practice, and measurability using routinely collected data. Here we examine the perceived determinants of adherence to these indicators, as perceived by health professionals, and examine the extent to which the determinants were indicator-specific or potentially generalisable across indicators. Methods We surveyed 60 general practitioners, practice nurses and practice managers in West Yorkshire, UK, on their compliance with four indicators: avoidance of risky prescriptions; Treatment goals in type 2 diabetes; Blood Pressure Goals in Treated Hypertension;' and Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation. The interview questions were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). The data were analyzed by frame analysis. Findings Professional role and identity as well as environmental context and resources featured prominently in all indicators, while the importance of other areas, e.g. B. beliefs about consequences, social influences and knowledge, varied for all indicators. We have identified five meta-themes that represent broader organizational and contextual factors common to all indicators. Conclusions The TDF has helped identify a variety of reported determinants of adherence to high-impact indicators in primary care. It was more difficult to determine which determinants, when targeted by an implementation strategy, would maximize change. Overall, the meta-themes underscore the need to align the design of interventions targeting general practices with higher-level support and broader contextual considerations. However, our results suggest that it is possible to design interventions to encourage uptake of different evidence-based indicators that share common characteristics while incorporating content-specific adjustments.",0,0,
1969,Leveraging the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) Database: How Are Clinicians Really Searching?,"OBJECTIVES: Clinicians and patients are increasingly accessing information through Internet searches. This study aimed to examine the current search behavior of clinicians when using the Turning Research Into Practice (TRIP) database to examine search engine usage and opportunities for improvement. METHODS: A weblog analysis of the TRIP database, a meta-search engine covering 150 healthcare resources including MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, and a variety of guidelines, was performed. The connectors for search terms were examined and the search behavior of 9 users when working with the TRIP database was observed. RESULTS: Of 620,735 searches, most used a single term and 12% (n=75,947) used a Boolean operator: 11% (n=69,006) used ""AND"" and 0.8% (n=4,941) used ""OR"". Of the elements of a well-structured clinical question (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome), the population was used most frequently, while fewer searches included the intervention. Comparator and result were rarely used. Participants in the observational study were interested in how to formulate better searches. CONCLUSIONS: Web log analysis showed that most searches used a single term and no Boolean operators. Observational study found that users were interested in conducting efficient searches but didn't always know how. Therefore, either better training or better search interfaces are needed to support users and enable more effective searches.",0,0,
1970,"Using theory to improve back pain management in primary care for Australian Aboriginal people: a single-cohort, mixed-methods pilot study","BACKGROUND: The management of low back pain (LBP) is often at odds with research. This pilot study evaluated changes in LBP care following a systematic, theory-based intervention in a rural Australian Aboriginal health service. Our goal was to improve three aspects of care: reduce inappropriate referrals for radiological imaging of LBP, improve psychosocially oriented patient assessment, and improve the provision of information on self-management of LBP to patients Systematic Implementation Approach: A Mixed-Methods Pre -/Post-cohort design assessed the changes in the three behaviors using a clinical audit of LBP care over a six-month period before the intervention and then after implementation. In-depth interviews elicited the perspectives of the primary care physicians involved. RESULTS: The proportion of patients receiving guideline-inconsistent imaging referral (GICI) improved from 4.1 GICI per 10 patients to 0.4 (95% CI for rate decrease: 1.6 to 5.6). ) among the general practitioners involved in the intervention ), the GICI rate increased from 1.5 to 4.4 GICI per 10 patients (95% CI for rate increase: 0.5 to 5.3). There was a slight increase in the number of patients receiving LBP self-management information from participating GPs and no significant changes in participants' psychosocially oriented patient assessments, however, GPs qualitatively reported that their behavior had changed Consequence knowledge and beliefs were important behavioral domains related to changes in environmental and resource factors, including on-site staff protocols and clinical tools embedded in patient management software, were identified as future strategies. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic intervention model resulted in partial improvements in LBP care, better knowledge of clinical guidelines, education from someone considered a trusted source of information, and awareness of the negative consequences of inappropriate practices, particularly the radiologist ic imaging, on patient outcomes problem that has emerged and will pose a significant future challenge. The systematic approach used is applicable to other services interested in improving LBP care.",0,0,
1971,"Use of wearable devices and smartphones to track physical activity: initial activation, sustained use, and step counts across sociodemographic characteristics in a national sample","Background: Interest in using wearable devices and smartphones to monitor daily health behaviors, such as B. physical activity, is increasing (1, 2). Many large employers use these technologies in workplace wellness programs (3). The Precision Medicine Initiative has described how the data collected by these technologies can be used for more targeted interventions. However, the characteristics of people using these devices are poorly understood. Objective: To describe the rates of initial activity tracker use, sustained use at 6 months, and step count by various sociodemographic characteristics from a wellness program offered in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on activity tracker use, average daily step count, and sociodemographic characteristics between 2014 and 2015 was collected by Humana from policyholders with access to HumanaVitality (now Go365), a wellness program offered in the United States.

1972,Validation of the SF-36 health survey questionnaire: new outcome measurement for primary care,"OBJECTIVES To test the acceptability, validity and reliability of the Short Form 36 Health Questionnaire (SF-36) and compare it to the Nottingham Health Profile. DESIGN Postal survey using a booklet of questionnaires together with a doctor's letter. Non-responders received two reminders two weeks apart. The SF-36 questionnaire was retested on a subsample of respondents two weeks after it was first sent. RECRUITMENT Two GP surgeries in Sheffield. PATIENTS 1980 patients aged 16-74 years randomly selected from the two practice lists. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES Scores for each health dimension on the SF-36 questionnaire and the Nottingham Health Profile. Answers to questions about recent use of health services and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS The response rate for the SF-36 questionnaire was high (83%) and the completion rate for each dimension was over 95%. Considerable evidence was found for the reliability of the SF-36 (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.85, reliability coefficient greater than 0.75 for all dimensions except social functioning) and for construct validity in discriminating between groups with expected health differences. The SF-36 was able to detect poor health in patients who scored a score of 0 (good health) on the Nottingham health profile. CONCLUSIONS The SF-36 is a promising new tool to measure the perception of health in the general population. It is easy to use, accepted by patients and meets strict criteria for reliability and validity. Their use in other contexts and in different disease groups requires further research.",0,0,
1973,Variations in primary care physicians' decisions to screen suspected lung cancer: a factorial experiment using multimedia vignettes,"Introduction Lung cancer survival rates in the UK are low and comparatively poor. Patients with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer often consult the general practitioner's office, but it's unclear how general practitioners (GPs) distinguish which patients need further evaluation. This study examined how patients' clinical and sociodemographic characteristics influence primary care physicians' decisions to initiate lung cancer screening. Methods A factorial experiment was conducted among a national sample of 227 English GPs using vignettes presented as simulated consultations. A multimedia interactive website simulated key features of consultations with actors (""patients""). GP participants made online treatment decisions for six ""patients"" whose sociodemographic characteristics varied systematically across three cancer risk levels. For low-risk vignettes, an investigation (ie, ordered chest x-ray, computed tomography, or referral from a respiratory specialist) was not indicated; for medium risk vignettes an investigation might be appropriate; in the case of vignettes with a high risk, an investigation was definitely indicated. Each ""patient"" had two lung cancer-related symptoms: one voluntarily and another when GPs asked for it. Variations in the probability of examination were examined using multi-level logistic regression. Results The general practitioners decided lung cancer in 74% (1000/1348) from vignettes. The probability of examination did not increase with the risk of cancer. Investigations were more likely when primary care physicians requested information about symptoms that ""patients"" had but did not agree to (adjusted OR (AOR) = 3.18; 95% CI 2.27 to 4.70 In 42% (570/ However, GPs failed to collect this information in 1348) of the cases.GPs were less likely to study older than younger ""patients"" (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.7) and black ""patients."" ' than white (AOR=0.6 ± 8; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). Conclusions GPs were no more likely to screen 'patients' with high-risk than low-risk cancer symptoms, nor did they screen everyone the same symptoms alike Inadequate data collection could account for missed opportunities in diagnosis.",0,1,

1975,"Violence and Aggression: Short-Term Management in Mental Health, Healthcare, and Community Settings: Updated Edition.","Â This guideline was developed to provide advice on short-term management of violence and aggression in mental health, healthcare and community settings for adults, children (up to age 12), and adolescents (ages 13 to 17). This guideline updates Violence: the Short-term Management of Disturbed/Violent Behavior in In-Patient Psychiatric Settings and Emergency Departments (NICE Clinical Guideline 25), developed by the National Collaborating Center for Nursing and Supportive Care and published in 2005 since publication Since the 2005 guideline, there have been some important advances in our knowledge of how to cope with violence and aggression, including service users' views on the use of physical intervention and seclusion, and the effectiveness, acceptability, and safety of medications and their doses for rapid calming. The previous guideline was limited to persons 16 years and older in adult psychiatric facilities and emergency departments"";"" This update adds some of the previously excluded populations and settings. All areas of the NICE clinical guideline 25 have been updated and this guideline will replace them entirely. The guideline recommendations were developed by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, people with mental health problems who have had personal experience of dealing with violent or aggressive behavior, their carers, and guideline methodologists after careful review of the best available evidence. The guideline is intended to be useful to clinicians and service providers in providing and planning quality care for dealing with violence and aggression, while emphasizing the importance of the experience of caring for these service users and the experience of their carers (see Appendix 1 for more details on the scope of the directive). Although the evidence base is growing rapidly, there are a number of major gaps. The guideline includes a number of research recommendations specifically designed to fill gaps in the evidence base. In the meantime, it is hoped that the guideline will help clinicians, service users and caregivers by identifying the merits of particular treatment approaches when evidence from research and clinical experience is available.",0,0,
1976,Violence in the GP Practice: A Survey of GP Views,"OBJECTIVE To assess the extent of abuse and violence against GPs in the course of their work and to categorize the characteristics of such aggression. DESIGN Retrospective survey of the views of a large sample of general practitioners using a piloted postal questionnaire. RECRUITMENT All medical practices in the West Midlands. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1093 general practitioners (40.6% of the total sample) who answered the questionnaire. KEY OUTCOME MEASUREMENT Number of incidents of aggression experienced by primary care physicians over a 12-month period and the presence of various precipitating factors. RESULTS Although the response was low at 40.6%, this study is the largest published database on GP aggression. Overall, 687 (62.9%) of respondents had experienced abuse or violence in the previous 12 months, and 191 (17.5%) had experienced some type of abuse at least once a month, and 11 (1%) had verbal abuse every month Abuse experienced day. Even assuming that all non-responders have not experienced violence, 25.5% of GPs in the West Midlands are affected by patient aggression. Among the physicians who had experienced patient aggression, the annual incidence of one event per primary care physician was 2.42. Overall, 96 (14%) of these GPs felt that aggression was increasing. A total of 1520 (91.3%) of all incidents involved verbal abuse or threats without direct physical action. Surgery was the most common site of aggression, with 942 (56.6%) incidents"";"" However, 90 (62.5%) of the incidents involving physical harm or assault occurred during home calls, and 22 (66%) of the injuries occurred during late-night calls. Relatives were the aggressors in 668 (37.6%) cases, fear was a trigger in 435 (25.7%) cases, and long waiting in 183 (10.8%) cases. CONCLUSIONS Violence against GPs is widespread and may be increasing. Some of the triggers of aggression may be preventable, and practices should make vigorous attempts to identify and address such factors. Staff training in interpersonal skills and recognizing anxious or intoxicated patients is essential and should be complemented by consideration of surgical layout and repair. Physicians should avoid delays for patients by changing booking policies or surgery times and durations. Victims of aggression must be followed up. A prospective study or a centralized record of incidents should be funded.",0,0,
1977,'We can only do what we have available from the perspective of 'GPs' for the primary care of older people with complex health problems,"BACKGROUND: Due to demographic change, general practitioners (family doctors) are increasingly required to care for older people with complex health problems. Little is known about the subjective assessments of general practitioners regarding the required changes. Our goal is to examine how primary care physicians view their professional responsibilities and capacities to provide comprehensive care to older people with complex health problems. Does geriatric education or experience influence perspectives? Are there barriers to implementing changes in primary care for older people with complex health problems? Methods: This qualitative study preceded a controlled intervention study on case management of elderly patients in general practice (OMAHA II) and included 10 general practitioners with different geriatric qualifications. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and tape-recorded. Full interview transcripts were analyzed starting with case-based open coding and case descriptions. The resulting thematic structure was enriched with comparative dimensions through repeated case comparisons and developed into a multidimensional view typology. RESULTS: Based on the issues arising from the data and their presentation by the general practitioners surveyed, we were able to identify three different perspectives on the primary care of older people with complex health problems: ""maneuvering at the limits of competence"", ""Herculean task"" and ""cooperation and networking"". The perspectives differ in terms of role perception, perception of one's own professional domain and patterns of action in relation to cooperation. One guy shows a strong correspondence with a geriatrician. Across all groups there is a shared interest in the availability of sufficient resources to meet the challenges of primary care for older people with complex health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Limited financial resources, lack of collaborative networks and attitudes appear to be barriers to ensuring better primary care for older people with complex health problems. To overcome these barriers, geriatric education should have a positive impact, but needs to be complemented by reimbursement regulations. Most importantly, GP care for older people with complex health problems needs a conceptual framework that provides guidance on their specific role and contribution, as well as supportive networks. For example, it is important that general treatment guidelines become more explicit about how to deal with older people with complex health problems.",0,0,
1978,Web-based computer tailoring for practice nurses to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines: A study protocol for a randomized controlled efficacy trial,"BACKGROUND: Dutch practice nurses have suboptimal adherence to evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines. Web-based computer tailoring could be effective in improving their compliance. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the development of a web-based computer-tailored program and the design of a randomized controlled trial testing its (cost-)effectiveness. METHODS: Theoretically grounded in the I-Change model and self-determination theory, and based on the results of a qualitative needs assessment among practicing nurses, a web-based, computer-based program was developed, comprising three modules of tailored counseling and an online forum, modules of up-to-date information on smoking cessation, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and project information as well as a counseling checklist. The impact of the program is assessed by comparing an intervention group (access to all modules) with a control group (access only to FAQs, project information and counseling checklist). Adherence to smoking cessation guidelines and behavioral predictors (ie, intention, knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, social influence, action and coping planning) will be measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months follow-up. In addition, the indirect effects of the program on smoking cessation rates and the number of smoking cessation attempts are assessed at 6 and 12 months. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the development of a web-based, computer-based adherence support program for practicing nurses and the study design of a randomized controlled trial testing its (cost) effectiveness. This program may contribute to improving the quality of smoking cessation treatment in Dutch general practices. If proven effective, the program could be adapted for use by other health professionals, thereby increasing public health benefits through improved cessation counseling for smokers.",0,0,
1979,Web-based interventions for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease: systematic review and future directions,"Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs), the application of psychological and behavioral interventions through the use of technology, offer physicians the opportunity to deliver care in a way that overcomes a number of treatment barriers. Web-based interventions are a subset of BITs that are emerging as promising alternatives for in-person treatment and monitoring of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). A systematic literature review led to five empirical studies on web-based interventions for UC and MC. In addition, an informal search of a popular search engine revealed limited currently available web-based interventions for patients with UC and CD. Although they represent an ideal population for the development and dissemination of online interventions, patients with UC and CD have far fewer treatment options compared to other behavioral health problems. With the growing body of research into web-based interventions for other conditions, researchers and clinicians involved in the management and treatment of ulcerative colitis and CD have the advantage of being able to leverage the BIT model, an existing conceptual framework for development web-based interventions for both diseases. The BIT model is presented and applied to the treatment of UC and CD, as well as a technology development program, Purple, and usability guidelines to guide clinical researchers in the future development, evaluation, and dissemination of BITs for patients with UC and CD.",0,0,
1980,Weekly email reminders influence emergency physician behavior: a case study using pneumonia guidelines from the Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,"OBJECTIVES: Improving physician compliance with evidence-based guidelines is a challenge. The authors wanted to determine whether weekly email reminders to emergency department (ED) staff increase compliance with the Joint Commission and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality standards for community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: A nurse reviewed weekly the records of all adult patients admitted to the hospital from the emergency department with a working diagnosis of pneumonia. An email was then sent to all emergency department staff detailing the percentage of patients whose antibiotic timing was less than 4 hours after arrival. The names of people who administered antibiotics in less than 1 hour were highlighted. This study compared time to antibiotics for 11 months before and 11 months after the start of this intervention. RESULTS: There were 281 patients in the control cohort and 37 met the exclusion criteria, leaving 244 for analysis. There were 342 patients in the intervention cohort and 40 met the exclusion criteria, leaving 302 for analysis. The median time from arrival to ordering the chest X-ray decreased significantly from 61 to 47 minutes (p<0.001). The median time interval from the request for a chest X-ray to the administration of antibiotics did not change significantly (92 to 88 minutes, p = 0.294). The median total time from arrival to antibiotic administration decreased significantly from 162 to 146 minutes (p=0.018). The proportion of patients receiving antibiotics within 4 hours increased from 77.5% to 86.1% (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Weekly email reminders detailing performance on antibiotic administration recommendations are associated with increased adherence to a clinical guideline.",1,1,

1982,"Weight maintenance: challenges, tools, and strategies for primary care physicians","Obesity is recognized as a chronic disease and one of the greatest public health challenges we face today. Weight loss can be achieved through lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical interventions, but weight maintenance remains a lifelong challenge for people with obesity. Obesity management guidelines have emphasized the role of primary care providers (PCPs). This review examines the long-term results of clinical trials to identify effective weight maintenance strategies that PCPs can utilize. Due to the breadth of the topic, a structured PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant research articles, peer reviews, guidelines, and articles published by regulators. Studies have shown the benefit of sustained weight loss in treating obesity and its comorbidities. Weight loss of 5-10% for >/= 1 year is known to alleviate many comorbidities. Maintaining weight with lifestyle changes—although difficult—is possible, but requires long-term support to increase diet, physical activity, and behavior changes. Complementing lifestyle intervention with pharmacotherapy promotes greater and more sustained weight loss. Clinical evidence and recently approved pharmacotherapies have given primary care physicians improved strategies to help their patients maintain weight loss. Further studies are needed to assess the translation of these strategies into clinical practice.",0,0,
1983,Weighty matters - an approach to obesity in children in general medicine,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, childhood obesity now rivals asthma as the most common chronic health problem in children. The last 2 decades have shown a rapidly increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in children with no signs of a plateau. Primary care is increasingly recognized as a forum in which to address this growing public health problem. AIM: This article discusses the epidemiology of childhood overweight and obesity in Australia and the associated physical and psychosocial morbidities. It discusses the current evidence base and resources for defining, investigating, and treating childhood obesity and outlines an approach in primary care. It also reports on a recently developed general practitioner who has implemented an intervention to reduce obesity in elementary school children - the Live, Eat and Play (LEAP) project. DISCUSSION: There are now clear clinical guidelines for the assessment and management of childhood overweight and obesity in primary care. The feasibility of these policies and the availability of the resources needed to implement them are not yet clear. The LEAP project proposes an effective intervention, carried out by general practitioners, to address this important and complex issue.",0,0,

1985,"WellDoc's Mobile Diabetes Management Randomized Controlled Trial: Changing Clinical and Behavioral Outcomes, and Patient and Physician Satisfaction","BACKGROUND: Less than 63% of people with diabetes meet professional guideline goals of hemoglobin A1c <7.0%, and only 7% meet combined blood glucose, lipid, and blood pressure goals. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the impact on A1c of a mobile phone-based diabetes management software system used with web-based data analysis and therapy optimization tools. Secondary objectives assessed compliance by healthcare providers (HCP) with prescribing guidelines and assessed HCP acceptance of the technology. METHODS: Thirty patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited from three physicians' offices for a 3-month study and randomized evenly. The intervention group received cell phone-based software developed by endocrinologists and CDEs (WellDoc Communications, Inc., Baltimore, MD). The software provided real-time feedback on patients' blood glucose levels, displayed patients' medication schedules, built-in algorithms to manage hypo- and hyperglycemia, and requested additional data needed to assess diabetes management. The patient data collected and transmitted to secure servers were analyzed by proprietary statistical algorithms. The system sent computer-generated logbooks (with suggested treatment plans) to the HCPs of the intervention patients. RESULTS: The mean decrease in A1c in intervention patients was 2.03% compared to 0.68% (p<0.02, one-sided) in control patients. Eighty-four percent of intervention patients had medication titrated or changed by their HCP compared to controls (23%, P=0.002). HCPs of intervention patients reported that the system facilitated treatment decisions, provided organized data, and reduced logbook review time. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with type 2 diabetes achieved statistically significant improvements in A1c using WellDoc's software. HCP and patient satisfaction with the system were clinically and statistically significant.",0,0,
1986,How do mental health professionals feel about guideline recommendations for treating depression in young people?,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate potential barriers to the use of evidence-based guidelines for adolescent depression in a tertiary mental health specialty service as part of an initiative to implement evidence-based practices within the service. METHODS: This was a qualitative study that took a social constructivist perspective using focus groups. The focus groups conducted with all clinicians (physicians and health professionals) were audiotaped, transcribed and thematically analyzed. Clinicians were asked about the barriers to implementing four key recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. RESULTS: Barriers existed at (i) the ""individual clinician"" level; (ii) the clinical level related to young people's presentation;"" and (iii) the level of service. The main barrier at the individual clinician level was the stated belief that the guidelines were not relevant to the young people presenting to the service and that there was little evidence of practice. The main obstacle related to clinical presentation was the severity and complexity of this presentation, which often made interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) difficult to deliver. At the service level, sequencing of interventions according to guideline recommendations has been difficult due to a lack of integration with primary and secondary care. CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need to develop the evidence base to ensure that effective treatments for young people aged up to 25 years with severe and complex disorders that include co-morbid conditions, suicidal risk and psychosocial difficulties are studied and disseminated. In addition, this work has highlighted the need for greater investment in models of care that ensure integration between existing primary and secondary care and improved specialized psychiatric early intervention services for young people.",0,0,
1987,What do GPs think and do about prostate cancer screening in Australia?,"BACKGROUND: Men seek advice from their general practitioner (GP) on the benefits of screening for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to examine how general practitioners' knowledge and clinical experience influenced their position on prostate cancer screening. Methods: A total of 13 focus groups with 77 general practitioners were set up. The focus group discussions were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed by thematic analysis by two investigators. RESULTS: Primary care physicians were evenly split between those who proactively screen men for prostate cancer and those who do so only at the patient's request. Primary care physicians had limited knowledge of recently published evidence from prostate cancer screening studies. DISCUSSION: In order to promote evidence-based decision-making by primary care physicians and their patients, effective methods to increase primary care physicians' knowledge of evidence-based recommendations and potential changes in clinical behavior are needed.",0,0,
1988,What do patients and relatives know about problems and failures in care?,"Objective Understand what patients and families know about problems and failures in healthcare. Design Qualitative, semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 39 patients and 80 family members about their experiences of tertiary care incidents. Nineteen interviews involved more than one respondent, making a total of 100 interviews. Participants were recruited through advertisements in the national broadsheet and tabloid print media (43%), through the health services where the incidents occurred (28%), through invitations from two internet marketing companies (27%) and through Consumer recruiting organizations (2%). Setting interviews were conducted at respondents' homes or by telephone. One participant emailed her responses to the questionnaire. Findings Analysis of the interview data revealed: (1) significant patient and family knowledge of health care risks, issues, and incidents; (2) respondents' insight into opportunities to improve care;' and (3) challenges patients and families face when attempting to negotiate their knowledge and insights with healthcare professionals. Conclusion Patients (and family members) need access to structured processes that ensure dialogue with healthcare professionals about perceived risks, problems and incidents. Such a dialogue would reveal patients' and family members' questions and knowledge about improvement opportunities and minimize the risk that their questions and knowledge are ignored.",0,0,
1989,What do people with mental illness need to quit smoking? Consumer and provider perspectives on mental health,"OBJECTIVES: Forty-one percent (41%) of people in the US who reported having a recent history of mental illness also smoke cigarettes. Tobacco use in this population is associated with up to 25 fewer years of life and excessive medical comorbidity compared to the general population. While research shows that tobacco interventions can be effective for people with mental illness, they are not commonly used in clinical practice. The current study examined how evidence-based tobacco cessation interventions can be adapted to address the unique physiological, psychological, and social challenges faced by people with mental illness. METHODS: Ten focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured discussion"";"" 5 for adult mental health users (n=62); and 5 with psychiatrists and administrators (n=22). Content analysis was used to organize topics into categories. RESULTS: Five thematic categories were identified: (1) treatment barriers, (2) resources and infrastructure, (3) negative influences on smoking behavior, (4) knowledge deficits, and (5) treatment needs. CONCLUSIONS: These results are instructive for the development of appropriate tobacco cessation services for this population. Specifically, these data were incorporated into a toolkit for mental health providers on smoking cessation and fed into the development of a tobacco cessation intervention study.",0,0,

1991,Which implementation measures increase cancer screening rates? a systematic review,"Background Adequate screening can reduce mortality and morbidity from colorectal, breast and cervical cancer. However, effective implementation strategies are warranted if the full benefits of screening are to be realized. As part of a larger agenda to create implementation guideline, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate interventions aimed at increasing screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC). The interventions considered were: customer reminders, customer incentives, mass media, small media, group instruction, one-to-one instruction, breaking down structural barriers, reducing own costs, provider evaluation and feedback interventions, and provider incentives. Our primary outcome, completion of screening, was calculated as the overall median absolute percentage point change (PP) post-intervention in completed screening tests. Methods Our first step was to conduct an iterative scoping review in the research area. This resulted in three relevant systematic reviews of high quality. As our evidentiary basis, we have performed a formal update. Randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials published between 2004 and 2010 were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE and PSYCHinfo. Results The update identified 66 new eligible studies with 74 comparisons. The quality of the new studies varied greatly. Customer reminders, small media, and provider audits and feedback appear to be effective interventions to increase screening uptake for three cancer types. Individual training and breaking down structural barriers also appear to be effective, but their role in CRC and cervical screening, respectively, is less established. Further studies are needed to evaluate customer incentives, mass media, grouping, captive cost reduction, and provider incentive interventions. Conclusion The new evidence is generally consistent with the evidence and conclusions from the original systematic reviews. This review served as the evidentiary basis for an implementation guideline. Poor reporting, lack of precision and consistency in defining farm elements, and insufficient consideration of context and differences between population groups are areas for additional research.",0,1,
1992,What role does the general practitioner play in relation to the caring relatives of a relative living with dementia? A systematic literature search,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the attitudes and perspectives of primary care physicians towards carers of family members with dementia and to describe carer satisfaction. DESIGN: Systematic review. TOPICS: The population studied consisted of families with dementia and their general practitioners. KEY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the primary care physician's overall role and ability to improve home care from the perspective of family caregivers. Caregivers were rated on their satisfaction with the care they received from their primary care physician. RESULTS: The primary care physician is aware of his or her capabilities and limitations in all aspects of dementia care and their role towards family caregivers. They also recognized the importance of an appropriate diagnostic procedure, but felt uncomfortable disclosing the diagnosis to both the patient and the caregiver. They reported having more confidence in treatment issues than in diagnostic phases. The reports of the carers about the attitude of their general practitioner in the diagnostic process were rated from helpful to not very empathetic. GPs found that they were highly involved in dementia home care, but nurses rated their involvement as insufficient. The GPs' lack of adequate communication skills was not appreciated by the nurses either. Lack of time and remuneration were seen by the general practitioner as a major obstacle in dementia care. CONCLUSION: The key role of GPs as service providers and care planners is reinforced by the caregivers' confidence in their abilities. Clear guidelines from early diagnosis to appropriate referrals should enhance the primary care physician's ability to support these time and energy consuming home care situations. Intervention studies addressing the gaps in primary care physicians' skills in managing dementia in the home could be helpful in supporting family caregivers.",0,0,
1993,"What is the value of routinely using patient-reported outcome measures to improve patient outcomes, nursing processes, and healthcare outcomes in cancer care? A systematic review of controlled trials","PURPOSE: The systematic use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) has been advocated as an effective method for standardizing cancer practice. Nevertheless, the question of whether PROMs can actually lead to an improvement in the quality of patient care remains controversial. This review examined whether the incorporation of PROM into routine clinical practice is associated with improvements in patient outcomes, care processes, and public health outcomes during active cancer treatment. METHODS: A systematic review of five electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL [Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature], PsycINFO, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection [PBSC]) was conducted from database inception to May 2012 to randomize and non-randomized controlled trials in patients receiving active anti-cancer treatment or supportive care, regardless of cancer type. RESULTS: Based on predefined eligibility criteria, we included 26 articles reporting 24 unique controlled trials. A great deal of variability was evident in the design and use of the interventions delivered, the outcomes assessed, and the cancer and modality-specific context. Health services were rarely included as endpoints. Overall, the number of statistically significant findings was limited and the intervention effect sizes of the PROMs were mostly small to moderate. CONCLUSION: The routine use of PROMs increases the frequency of discussion of patient outcomes during consultations. In some studies, PROMs are associated with improved symptom control, increased supportive care, and patient satisfaction. Additional efforts are needed to ensure patient compliance, as well as additional support for physicians responding to patients' concerns and issues, with clear system policies in place to guide their responses. Further research is needed to support the cost-effectiveness of PROM in terms of patient safety, clinical burden, and health care utilization.",0,0,
1994,What should we teach students?,"The opinions of 600 randomly selected physicians on what students should be taught in clinical years were analyzed. General medicine, paediatrics, general surgery, accident surgery and gynecology were given high priority by those surveyed, but forensic medicine, plastic surgery, radiation therapy, anaesthesia, radiology and rehabilitation medicine were given low priority. Doctors thought these should be taught to postgraduates. The two large groups of doctors - general practitioners and specialists - gave essentially the same priorities. Undergraduate curricula cannot cover all major disciplines, so the results of this analysis can provide a useful basis for selecting the most appropriate subjects. Criteria for the inclusion of further disciplines can be the skills and enthusiasm of the teachers as well as well thought-out and academically sound teaching programmes.",0,0,
1995,What's in an environment?: Impact of organizational culture on provider compliance with clinical guidelines for tobacco use management,"BACKGROUND: Organizational culture is an important but understudied characteristic of the work environment that can influence provider behavior, including adherence to clinical practice guidelines. There is strong evidence that medical support for smokers can lead to significant reductions in tobacco use. However, this evidence has not translated well into practice, as only a small proportion of smokers receive recommended treatment during doctor visits. PURPOSE: This study examines organizational culture as a contextual feature of primary care clinics and its impact on adherence to evidence-based tobacco treatment policies. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from 500 primary care physicians at 60 community hospitals in New York City. The relationships between provider compliance with clinical guidelines “5A” as recommended by the US Public Health Service and both provider and organizational covariates have been described. We used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the associations between clinic culture and provider treatment patterns. RESULTS: Providers in clinics with stronger 'group/clan', 'hierarchical' and 'rational' culture types compared to a 'developmental' culture reported greater adherence to 5A guidelines (p<0.05). System-level structures and nursing processes were positively associated (p<0.01), while the number of ongoing quality initiatives was negatively associated with 5A delivery (p<0.05). Provider familiarity with the guidelines (p<0.01), trust in smoking cessation counseling (p<0.05), and perceived effectiveness in smoking cessation were associated with more frequent 5A interventions (p<0.01). IMPACT ON PRACTICE: The results suggest that organizational culture can influence provider adherence to treatment guidelines, even when controlling for other factors known to influence practice patterns. In particular, cultures that emphasize human resources and performance standards are conducive to incorporating 5A policies into routine practice. Understanding the role of organizational culture enables healthcare managers and practitioners to be strategic in implementing and also maintaining the use of evidence-based guidelines.",0,0,
1996,What's on YOUR Facebook profile? Evaluation of an educational effort to promote the appropriate use of privacy settings by medical students on social networking sites,"BACKGROUND: The rise of social media has led to growing concern about the potential impact of ""unprofessional"" postings by physicians and medical students on individuals, institutions, and the medical community. Relevant and effective policies have been difficult to develop and enforce, and there is a need for students and physicians to think about how their online activities can be viewed in the context of their professional role. The purpose of this project was to study the internet presence of a Canadian medical school class by scanning students' public profiles on the social media site Facebook, integrating this information into an educational activity dealing with professionalism and social media, and to assess the impact of this activity on student behavior. METHODS: A systematic search of the public Facebook profiles of each member of the class was conducted and data was collected on the types of publicly viewable material. These were presented as part of an educational event on social media and professionalism. A month later, the Facebook search was repeated. RESULTS: Of 152 students in the class, profiles were found for 121 (79.8%). The majority of students used reasonably restrictive privacy settings"";"" However, a significant minority had publicly viewable information, including comments, photos, location, and medical student status. The educational innovation was well received, with more than 90% of students agreeing that the topic was important and well covered. A subsequent search revealed that many students had changed their privacy settings to make less information publicly available. CONCLUSIONS: A small but significant proportion of students share potentially unprofessional content on social media. An interactive pedagogical intervention that involved specific disclosure of how participants came across to others on social media resulted in a significant change in student behavior.",0,0,
1997,When is it cost-effective to change healthcare professional behavior?,"Because of the way healthcare systems work, new, important and inexpensive treatments sometimes do not become routine care, while well-marketed products of ambiguous value find widespread acceptance. Should policy makers seek to influence clinical behavior and correct these inefficiencies? Implementation methods achieve some level of behavior change but cost money to implement. These factors can be combined with the cost-effectiveness of treatments to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the overall policy. In general, the cost-effectiveness of the policy is always less attractive than the cost-effectiveness of the treatment. As a result, trying to improve uptake of underused inexpensive care or reduce overuse of new and expensive treatments may not always make economic sense. In this article we present a method for calculating the cost-effectiveness of the policy and illustrate it with examples from a recent study carried out in 1997 and 1998 of community pharmacist awareness campaigns about medical prescription in England to influence.",0,0,
1998,When pharmacotherapeutic recommendations may result in an adverse effect on physician decision-making,"The medical literature has long demonstrated that patients do not always receive adequate care, including pharmacotherapeutic treatment. To achieve improved patient care, a number of physician-focused interventions are being conducted internationally to implement evidence-based medicine into the daily routine practice of physicians. The pharmacist profession has taken an active role in providing intervention strategies aimed at promoting evidence-based prescribing and improved quality and safety of drug use. However, the medical literature also supports the notion that valid clinical treatment recommendations do not always have the desired effect on physician behavior. We argue that the well-established theory of psychological reactance may at least partially explain cases in which physicians do not follow such recommendations. Reactance theory suggests that when prompted to take a specific action, a motivational state compels us to respond in ways that affirm our agency. Often we choose to do the opposite of what the recommendation suggests, or we simply remain where we are. The basic concepts of psychological reactance are universal and likely applicable to providing recommendations to physicians. Making recommendations about clinical care, including pharmacotherapy, can carry implicit threats as it can be perceived as an attempt to limit one's freedom of choice, potentially leading to reactions and efforts to avoid them. By identifying and addressing factors likely to promote reactance, physician-focused interventions could become more effective.",0,0,

But the safety and effectiveness of these compounds have been exaggerated, the effectiveness of psychotherapy has been overlooked and distorted, and various medical guidelines for treating perinatal depression have been downplayed or ignored. This article addresses the common fears and misconceptions surrounding the treatment of depression during pregnancy and after childbirth. The effectiveness of strategic cognitive behavioral therapy, enhanced by hypnosis, offers excellent results without the risks associated with these drugs.

2003,Why aren't clinicians accepting the results from pivotal clinical trials in severe sepsis? A Bayesian analysis,"BACKGROUND: Five pivotal clinical trials (intensive insulin therapy; recombinant human activated protein C [rhAPC]; low tidal volume; low dose steroid; early targeted therapy [EGDT]) have demonstrated a reduction in mortality in patients with severe sepsis and expert guidelines have them for the recommended in clinical practice, but acceptance of these therapies among clinicians remains low. Question 2: What is the current probability of increasing the relative risk of death (RRR) of my patient with severe sepsis around meaningful clinical thresholds (RRR > 15%; > 20% ; > 25%)? METHODS: Bayesian methods were applied to this study. Odds ratio (OR) was considered for question 1 and RRR was used for question 2. Effective sample sizes from other relevant clinical trials (unfavorable evidence). Posterior distributions were calculated by combining the previous distributions and the data from pivotal studies (favorable evidence). KEY FINDINGS: Answer 1 - The analysis, based on slightly skeptical antecedents, shows favorable results with the intensive insulin, rhAPC, and low tidal volume studies, but not with the low-dose steroid and EGDT studies. All study results are rendered unacceptable by the analyzes with moderate or severe skeptics. Answer 2 – If we aim for an RRR > 15%, the slightly skeptical analysis shows that the current probability of reducing death around this clinical threshold is 88% for the intensive insulin and 62-65% for the low-tidal volume, rhAPC , is , EGDT studies and 17% for the low-dose steroid study. The moderate and severe skeptical analyzes show no clinically meaningful reduction in risk of death for all studies. If we aim for an RRR > 20% or > 25%, all probabilities of benefit become smaller, regardless of the level of skepticism. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical threshold analysis provides a new bedside tool that can be directly applied to the care of patients with severe sepsis. Our results indicate that the strength of evidence (statistical and clinical) is weak for all studies, particularly the low-dose steroid and EGDT studies. It is imperative to replicate the results of each of these five clinical trials in confirmatory studies if we are to offer patient care based on scientifically sound evidence.",0,0,
2004,Why do doctors treat their loved ones? Exploring the influence of social psychology,"Doctors often receive requests for treatment, medical advice, or other interventions from loved ones. Most doctors do this. Reasons for compliance can be categorized according to the physician's attitude toward the family member, colleague, self, ethical guidelines, and the problem. Compliance can also be influenced by elements of social psychology. Social exchange theory, persuasion techniques, attribution, conformity, the desire for recognition, and the affinity principle can prompt interventions. Future research should examine physicians' attitudes towards family members, the medium through which inquiries are made, treatment outcomes, changes in the relationship after treatment, cultural or family norms, and changes in physicians' beliefs or behaviors that occur when they are with be confronted with conflicting requests and guidelines. Knowing these influences can help physicians make objective decisions about an intervention.",0,0,

2007,Why providers are transfusing blood products outside of recommended guidelines despite built-in electronic best practice warnings,"BACKGROUND: Best practice alerts (BPAs) provide clinical decision support (CDS) at the point-of-care to reduce unnecessary transfusions of blood products despite continuing significant transfusions outside of recommended guidelines. AIM: Understand why providers order blood transfusions outside of recommended guidelines despite disruptive warnings. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Providers of inpatient health services. INTERVENTION: Provider-BPA interaction data was collected from January 2011 to August 2012 from the hospital electronic medical record. MEASUREMENTS: Vendor (free text) responses to BPA prompts for blood transfusion were independently reviewed and categorized by 2 licensed physicians, with agreement assessed by chi(2) analysis and kappa scoring. RESULTS: Reasons for overriding blood transfusion BPA varied widely, with acute bleeding being the most common (>34%), followed by recorded behaviors at specialty services (up to 26%) through to ""symptomatic"" anemia (11%- 12%). . Many providers transfuse in anticipation of surgery or a procedure (10% to 15%) or impending hospital discharge (2% to 5%). Physicians in private practice represented the majority (55%) of providers who interacted with BPA. CONCLUSION: Vendors interacting with BPAs (primarily resident and mid-market vendors) often do not have the bargaining power to change ordering behavior. Recorded behaviors that are unlikely to be influenced by BPA are among the most commonly cited reasons for transfusions outside of guidelines. Symptomatic anemia is a common, albeit subjective, indication for blood transfusions. Given the multitude of individually unusual reasons for transfusion behavior, the secondary use of electronic medical record databases and integrated CDS tools is important to efficiently analyze common practice behavior.",0,0,
2008,Why we still do arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis: a multi-method study,"BACKGROUND: Knee arthroscopy has historically been a common treatment for knee osteoarthritis. However, several randomized controlled trials along with a Cochrane review have led to NICE recommending not using arthroscopy in the vast majority of patients with knee osteoarthritis. These recommendations have been replicated internationally. The use of arthroscopy for knee osteoarthritis has decreased"";"" however, it is still widely used. This study examines the factors thought to influence decision making using a theoretical framework developed for behavior change research (Theoretical Domains Framework). This study will allow future work to design and evaluate an intervention specifically targeting the identified barriers. METHODS: A multimodal approach was used, including questionnaire research and semi-structured interviews with physicians of all grades providing knee arthroscopy service at a Level 1 trauma center in the West Midlands, UK. Focus groups were also conducted with patients. A mixed methods analysis was used, with descriptive statistics for quantitative data and thematic content analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 26 surgeons completed questionnaires, with 6 semi-structured interviews taking place. All surgical grades were represented. Two focus groups of six patients were conducted. The results identified 13 beliefs in 12 domains (some beliefs were represented in all domains). The beliefs that there was pressure from patients to do something, that there were limited other options, that surgeons wanted to meet patient expectations, and that there was time pressure in the clinic seemed to be the predominant obstacles. CONCLUSIONS: Using the Theoretical Domains Framework, this paper has described the relevant barriers and requirements for implementing the NICE guidelines regarding the use of arthroscopy in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The next step in this process is the development of a targeted intervention, and we discuss the barriers that are most likely to change practice when a targeted intervention is implemented and what such an intervention might look like. Such an intervention would require evaluation within the clinical setting.",0,0,
2009,Why don't women ask for preconception health information? A qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Preconceptional care includes health promotion to reduce risk factors that may affect women and couples of childbearing age. Risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes include recognized family or individual genetic disorders, prior congenital disorders, miscarriage, premature birth, fetal growth restriction, infertility, maternal chronic disease, lifestyle, and occupational or environmental factors. Effective preconception care includes a range of preventive, therapeutic, and behavioral interventions. Although Italy has national preconceived treatment recommendations for the general population, these are usually recommended informally and only for individual risk factors. Currently, there is increasing interest in offering a global intervention in this area. The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes and behaviors of Italian women of childbearing age and healthcare professionals regarding preconception health. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among women of childbearing potential and healthcare professionals between February 2014 and February 2015. Five focus groups were held: 2 with non-pregnant women aged 22 to 44 and 3 with healthcare professionals. Topics for discussion included women's questions about preconception health, concerns and barriers to preconception care, attitudes and behaviors of women and healthcare professionals regarding preconception health, and sources of information for women. In the analysis of the focus groups, priority was given to the women's comments, supplemented by information from the focus groups of health professionals. RESULTS: Fourteen women of reproductive age (8 null and 6 multiparous) and 12 healthcare professionals (3 nurses, 4 midwives, 5 physicians) participated in the focus groups. The results indicate the presence of many barriers and a lack of awareness of preconceived notions about health in relation to women, health professionals and policies. Women's knowledge of and attitudes to primary preconception care information are described. The main source of information in this area for Italian women seems to be their obstetrician-gynaecologist. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that several barriers influence preconception care in Italy. There is also evidence of a lack of awareness of preconceived notions about health and care among Italian women of childbearing age and among healthcare professionals. Findings could contribute to strategies for implementing guidelines for preconception care.",0,0,
2010,WIC providers' perspectives on the delivery of smoking cessation interventions,"PURPOSE: To study the perspectives of WIC clinic providers to provide smoking cessation interventions for pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four focus groups consisting of WIC nurses, nutritionists, and social workers (N = 25) were conducted in WIC clinics in eastern Iowa. Researchers developed discussion guides to determine how WIC providers are currently targeting pregnant women who smoke cigarettes and what they believe are barriers to the delivery of effective smoking cessation interventions. Code mapping was used to analyze focus group discussions. RESULTS: Factors that influenced the ability of WIC staff to provide smoking cessation interventions to pregnant women included time available, clinic priorities, staff interaction with clients, and staff training. In addition, providers raised concerns about customer educational materials and other customer issues that prevent them from quitting smoking. The lack of mechanisms to track clinical outcomes related to smoking cessation was also noted. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: WIC providers have time constraints that may require minimal or low-intensity smoking cessation interventions, but have been unaware that such approaches are actually effective. WIC providers need more education on the whole issue of smoking cessation to become more proactive in their attempts to help pregnant women quit. Training that improves self-efficacy and understanding of the effects of smoking on mothers, infants and children should be initiated to motivate staff to intervene. Another strategy to motivate WIC staff in this regard could be to track clinical outcomes to help women quit smoking or prevent relapse.",0,0,
2011,Will mothers of sick children help their husbands quit smoking after receiving brief intervention from nurses? Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Passive smoking is a serious health risk for children. Clinical guidelines suggest that caregivers advise smoking parents to quit when accompanying their sick children to pediatric facilities, but the guidelines make no mention of what caregivers can do when the parents are not with the children. This study examines the effectiveness of a nurse-led, low-intensity health education initiative for non-smoking mothers to motivate them to take action to help their husbands quit smoking. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial and 1,483 non-smoking women living with smoking husbands were recruited as they accompanied their ill children to hospital admissions to general pediatric/outpatient departments of four Hong Kong hospitals. The women were randomized into intervention and control groups. The former received a brief health education consultation from nurses, a specially designed health education pamphlet, a ""no smoking"" sticker, and a week later a telephone reminder "";"" the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the women's action to help their smoking husbands quit smoking at the 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up visits. RESULTS: A higher proportion of women in the intervention group than in the control group had taken action to help their husbands stop smoking at 3 months (76% vs. 65%, P<0.001), 6 months (66% vs. 49%, P<0.001) and 12 months (52% vs. 40%, P<0.001) follow-ups. Women who received the intervention had better knowledge about the health hazards of smoking, a higher willingness to take action, and a willingness to take action true of their husbands to quit/cut down smoking had previously advised their husbands to give quit smoking were aware of their husbands' smoking history and knew that their husbands had made a previous attempt to quit smoking and intended to help them with their follow-up visits, quitting smoking can be effective in motivating the mothers of sick children to take action to help their husbands cope to quit smoking recommend adding the following to the clinical practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and addiction: “Caregivers should give any non-smoking mother of a sick child a brief piece of advice to encourage their husbands to quit smoking”.

2012,Words matter: improve the implementation of clinical guidelines.,"Objectives: To determine whether writing clinical guideline recommendations in behavioral “plain English” language increases the likelihood of their implementation by service users (patients). Design: Randomized controlled trial in which participants received either the original text of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) public guidelines for the management of schizophrenia or a behavioral text with the same content. Setting: User networks for mental health services and voluntary sector organizations in two central London boroughs. Participants: 84 mental health service users recruited by mail or face-to-face at user meetings. Intervention: The section of the NICE public guidelines for schizophrenia regarding psychological and pharmacological treatments was rewritten to improve style and behavioral specificity by applying evidence-based and psychologically sound principles of good written communication. Outcome Measures: Cognitive behavioral predictors, as specified by the evidence-based theory of planned behavior, provided the primary outcome as it was not possible to measure actual behavior of guideline implementation. The predictors were behavioral intentions to implement the guidelines, attitudes towards implementation, and perceived behavioral control over implementation. Satisfaction with the guidelines and perceived understanding were also measured. Results: Behavioral guidelines in “plain English” resulted in stronger intentions to implement the guidelines, more positive attitudes toward them, and greater perceived behavioral control over their application. There was no difference in satisfaction or perceived understanding. Conclusions: Writing policies with high behavioral specificity combined with using “plain English” can be a simple and effective way to improve their implementation. An assessment with a behavior score is now required.",0,1,
2013,Working to improve hospital management of hyperglycemia through statewide collaboration: the Georgia Hospital Association Diabetes Special Interest Group,"OBJECTIVE: To review the efforts of the Georgia Hospital Association Diabetes Special Interest Group (DSIG) to develop and disseminate model clinical guidelines for the management of inpatient hyperglycemia. METHODS: Beginning in February 2003, a consortium of physicians and related health professionals from across the state of Georgia began meeting regularly to formulate a plan to improve the care of hospitalized patients with hyperglycemia. The immediate goals of the DSIG were to identify and organize interested stakeholders, develop common clinical guidelines, and disseminate information. RESULTS: Since its inception, the DSIG has accomplished the following: developed 7 consensus clinical guideline templates, built a website that publishes these clinical guidelines and other useful information and educational materials, and sponsored workshops throughout the state of Georgia. CONCLUSION: As the importance of glucose control in the hospital setting is increasingly recognized, institutions must find ways to apply clinical trial results to “real” hospital settings. The DSIG is an example of a successful collaboration that could serve as a model for other government hospital organizations looking to develop programs to improve inpatient care for patients with hyperglycemia.",0,0,

(International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN 81079604) Setting: 13 UK Non-National Health Service establishments. Patients: 313 adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain. Intervention: Yoga (n=156) or usual care (n=157). All participants received an educational brochure about back pain. The intervention group was offered a 12-hour progressive yoga program conducted by 12 teachers over 3 months. Measurements: Results of the RolandÂ¨CMorris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) at 3 (primary outcome), 6, and 12 (secondary outcome) months""; pain, pain self-efficacy, and general health measurements at 3, 6, and 12 months (secondary outcomes) Results: 93 ( 60%) Patients offered yoga attended at least 3 of the first 6 sessions and at least 3 additional sessions The yoga group had better back function than usual care at 3, 6, and 12 months Adjusted mean RMDQ score was higher in the yoga group Group 2.17 points (95% CI, 1.03 to 3.31 points) lower at 3 months, 1.48 points (CI, 0.33 to 2.62 points) and 1.57 lower at 6 months Scores (CI, 0.42 to 2.71 points) lower at 12 months The yoga and general care groups had similar scores for back pain and general health at 3, 6, and 12 months, and the yoga group had at 3 and 6 months higher pain self-efficacy scores do not at 12 months Two of the 157 usual care participants and 12 of the 156 yoga participants reported adverse events, mainly increased pain Note: Data were missing for the primary endpoint (yoga group, n=21; ""normal care group"", n = 18) and differential missing data (more in the yoga group) for secondary endpoints. Conclusion: Providing adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain with a 12-week yoga program resulted in greater improvement in back function than usual treatment.",0,0,
2018,Adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment are not immune to poor diet and obesity: a call for dentists to get involved in prevention efforts,"OBJECTIVES: While obesity is widespread in the US, differences exist. Orthodontic trials are believed to be more affluent than the general population and do not require assistance in developing or maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This paper assesses the need for intervention in the orthodontic population by examining the diet and weight status of an orthodontic patient specimen and describes a role for dentists in obesity prevention efforts. METHODS: 552 patients, aged 8-14 years, 54% female, 51% non-Hispanic White, 26% Hispanic, were recruited from orthodontic practices in Southern California to participate in a randomized controlled trial of physician health promotion. Height, weight, demographics and diet were recorded. Chi-square analyzes were used to test for differences at baseline by sex, age, race, and income. RESULTS: 13% of the sample was overweight and 9% obese. Men had a higher rate of obesity than women. Low-income youth had a higher rate than higher-income youth. Hispanic youth had a higher rate than non-Hispanic white youth. Non-compliance with national dietary guidelines was widespread and varied significantly across demographic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Within a sample not normally considered needy, nearly 25% were overweight or obese and the majority were not following dietary recommendations. While most patients could benefit from an intervention, male, Hispanic, and low-income groups needed the most support. Dentists, who see young people frequently and who are already discussing nutrition in the context of oral health, have the opportunity to make a contribution to the prevention of obesity.",0,0,
2019,systematic scoping review of the choice architecture movement: To understand when and why nudges work,"In this article, we provide a general scoping review of the nudge movement realm by reviewing 422 choice architecture interventions in 156 empirical studies. We report the distribution of studies across countries, years, domains, subdomains of applicability, intervention types, and the moderators associated with each intervention category to review the current state of the nudge movement. In addition, we highlight certain features of the studies, as well as experimental and reporting practices, that may impede the accumulation of evidence in this area. Specifically, we found that 74% of the studies were primarily motivated to assess the effectiveness of the interventions in a given setting, while only 24% of the studies focused on exploring facilitators or underlying processes. We also found that only 7% of studies used power analysis, 2% used guidelines to improve reporting quality, no study was pre-registered in our database, and the intervention nomenclature used was incomplete and often overlapped categories. Building on our current observations and proposed solutions from other areas, we provide directly applicable recommendations for future research to support the collection of evidence about why and when nudges work.",0,1,
